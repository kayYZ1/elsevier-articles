This fact has been con- uously emphasized from the earliest pioneering work (cf. [107,123,108], to name but a few) right up to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most cent contributions [179]. However, while substantial efforts have been devoted through the years to developing methods r the acquisition of knowledge, either manually [186,64] or automatically [54,27,143], the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcknowledge acquisition ttleneck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 still represents one of the main obstacles to performing complex intelligent tasks with human-level perfor- ance [97,179]. Recently, however, this stalemate has begun to loosen up. The availability of large amounts of wide-coverage seman- knowledge, and the ability to extract it using powerful statistical methods [209,53, inter alia], are enabling signifi- nt advances in applications requiring deep understanding capabilities, such as information retrieval [36] and question- swering engines [57]. Thus, although the well-known problems of high cost and scalability discouraged the development knowledge-based approaches in the past, more recently the increasing availability of online collaborative knowledge Corresponding author.

This, in turn, has made these online resources one of the main driving forces behind e renaissance of knowledge-rich approaches in AI and NLP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, approaches that exploit large amounts of machine- adable knowledge to perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Collaboratively constructed knowledge repositories, in ct, have been used as wide-coverage sources of semi-structured information and manual annotations for a wide range AI and NLP applications, and have consistently proved beneficial. Wikipedia 1 is a case in point of this research trend, ing the largest and most popular collaborative and multilingual resource of world and linguistic knowledge that contains structured and (semi-)structured information. This special issue seeks to provide a comprehensive picture of the state of the art of research aimed at exploiting semi- ructured resources for AI and NLP, focusing on both the acquisition of machine-readable knowledge from these resources d the effective use of this knowledge to perform AI and NLP tasks. The initial pioneering work on using Wikipedia for search in AI was carried out around 2005\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2006, and since then there have been a very large number of high-impact ntributions in this area by leading research groups. In particular, proceedings from all major conferences in AI, NLP and formation Retrieval (IR) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including IJCAI, AAAI, ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, WWW and CIKM, to name only the top con- rence venues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have included in all past years a substantial number of contributions on this topic. Moreover, researchers orking in this area have striven to be very active, as shown by the workshops regularly held at IJCAI, AAAI, ACL and LING [28,29,128,66,65]. We argue that the popularity enjoyed by this line of research is a consequence of the fact that ) it provides a viable solution to some of AI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-lasting problems, crucially including the quest for knowledge [179]; i) it has wide applicability spanning many different sub-areas of AI \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as shown by the papers found in this special is- e, which range from computational neuroscience [154] to information retrieval [82,102], through works in knowledge quisition [73,130,192] and a variety of NLP applications such as Named Entity Recognition [148], Named Entity disam- guation [67] and computing semantic relatedness [122,216]. Other applications include the study of modality [125,189], e generation of referring expressions [92,16], Question Answering [199], Recognizing Textual Entailment [219],textsim- ification [211],etc. This introduction to the special issue is structured as follows. We begin in Section 2 by discussing the limitations of both structured and structured resources. We then show how semi-structured resources overcome these problems by pro- ding a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middle ground\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between structured and unstructured resources, thus bringing together the best of both worlds. a nutshell, we argue that collaboratively-generated, semi-structured information is made up of content which is (a) se- antified, (b) wide-coverage, (c) up-to-date, (d) multilingual, and (e) free in nature. Thanks to the combination of all these atures, this kind of resource provides an ideal environment for acquiring large amounts of machine-readable knowledge, d deploying it effectively for a wide spectrum of AI and NLP tasks. While there are many semi-structured resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cluding Wiktionary, 2 Flickr, 3 Twitter 4 and Yahoo! Answers 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we concentrate in this paper on Wikipedia as a case in int, seeing as it is the largest and most popular collaborative, multilingual resource of world and linguistic knowledge at contains unstructured and (semi-)structured information. We support our argument by looking at evidence from the search literature. To this end, we provide a survey of previous work centered on three main lines of research: 1. Using Wikipedia to acquire wide-coverage machine-readable knowledge (Section 3), including ontologized resources such as taxonomies and ontologies (Section 4). 2. Applying knowledge from Wikipedia to semantic Natural Language Processing tasks (Section 5). 3. Exploiting Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinguishing features, such as its versioned, continuously updated content (Section 6) and mul- tilinguality (Section 7). This way we are able not only to provide a thematic survey of work that has used collaborative, semi-structured content, t also to contextualize the various contributions collected in this special issue, introducing them into the discussion at propriate points. We conclude with general remarks and considerations about future directions for this line of research in ction 8. Why semi-structured resources? Intelligent applications in need of knowledge can choose from many different resources, ranging from automatically nerated, unstructured ones (e.g., language models computed from plain text) all the way to manually-assembled, fully- ructured ones (i.e., ontologies). In the middle lie those resources which are the focus of this special issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c semi-structured es. In this section we concentrate on the pros and cons of each kind of resource. More specifically, we try to answer e question of what makes semi-structured resources preferable to alternative machine-readable knowledge sources or, other words, how they help overcome the limitations of such sources. To this end, we first look at the strengths and http://www.wikipedia.org. http://www.wiktionary.org. http://www.flickr.com.http://twitter.com. http://answers.yahoo.com. 4w of ea Un co is ch th se W lie w hy th tio in re tr of (a (b St in re be w (c 6 7 wnE. Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 eaknesses of both structured and unstructured resources, and show how collaboratively-generated semi-structured content fers a powerful solution for combining the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best of both worlds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while at the same time overcoming the limitations of ch. structured resources. The simplest kind of resource is just a collection of text, images or other multimedia content. Text llections (i.e., corpora) are the main kind of unstructured resource. By \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unstructured\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we refer to the way knowledge formalized. In fact, while corpora provide some organizational structure (e.g., division by sentence, paragraph, section, apter, document, etc.), they encode information only by means of strings of text. As a result the knowledge available erein is not machine-readable, as strings are readable only at the character and word level. Resources such as raw text and unannotated corpora are easy to harvest on a very large scale, thanks to the Web. Con- quently, NLP research has devoted considerable efforts in recent years to exploiting free-form running text by using the eb as a corpus [89,86,169,96,15,88,198,134, inter alia]. Knowledge encoded within statistical models of word co-occurrence s at the core of language models [104,81] and vector space models [176], which are both essential components of real- orld applications like Machine Translation and Information Retrieval. Moreover, work based on the so-called distributional pothesis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, the idea that similar words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meaning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has shown at theoretically sound statistical approaches can produce robust models encoding different levels of linguistic informa- n, including selectional preferences, lexical meaning and word similarity (see [197] for a survey). Distributional models, turn, have been used for many different applications, ranging from the automatic acquisition of open-domain facts [151], lations [14] and full-fledged knowledge bases [32], to high-end tasks such as question answering [190], and document re- ieval and clustering [103]. Notwithstanding these major achievements we can identify at least two fundamental limitations using raw, unstructured data: ) The knowledge gap. Statistical models induced from very large amounts of text are known to be extremely powerful and robust [68]. However, they all still suffer from the knowledge acquisition bottleneck \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., they are not able to auto- matically acquire all the knowledge required for complex inference chains [49]. For instance, common sense knowledge (birds can fly) is almost never overtly expressed within the language data from which structured knowledge can then be extracted (e.g., on the basis of co-occurrence statistics). ) Degree and quality of ontologization. Large amounts of knowledge can be extracted from the Web with high precision in a minimally supervised fashion (cf., e.g., the Open Information Extraction framework of Banko et al. [14]). However, the output of these systems is typically not ontologized \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, it is not included within a semantic network of unam- biguously defined concepts and their semantic relations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and thus does not comply to the characteristics of a fully structured knowledge base or ontology. While recent contributions have tried to tackle this issue [163,91,143,55],ques- tions remain as to whether the quality of their output is on a par with that of manually created resources. ructured resources. There are many different kinds of machine-readable structured resources, depending on the level of formation they encode (cf. the Ontology Learning Layer Cake presented by Buitelaar et al. [26]). These include: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Thesauri. Thesauri are collections of related terms, some of which like, for instance, Roget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [172] and the Macquarie [19] Thesaurus, are specifically focused on synonyms and antonyms. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Taxonomies. The next level of structuring is that of a taxonomy, which is a hierarchically-structured classification of terms (e.g., a computer scientist is-a person). An example of a taxonomy is provided by the Open Directory Project, 6 which categorizes Web pages into a number of domains. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ontologies. An ontology is a fully-structured knowledge model, including concepts, relations of various kinds and, pos- sibly, rules and axioms. Concepts are the basic units of an ontology and identify meanings that belong to models of different domains. If an ontology is lexicalized, a concept is associated with one or more terms that express it by means of language. Examples of lexicalized and general-purpose ontologies are WordNet [56] and Cyc [98]. Manually-assembled repositories of structured knowledge contain information of the highest quality, since their content flects the contribution of experts such as lexicographers and ontologists. This knowledge, in turn, has been shown to be neficial for virtually all kinds of intelligent applications. 7 However, the acquisition and application of the knowledge found ithin fully-structured, manually-assembled resources exhibits non-trivial problematic issues: ) Creation and maintenance effort. As is often the case with human-labeled data, the manual creation of these resources does not scale and is extremely time-consuming, while the extracted knowledge is difficult to maintain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., keep con- tinuously updated with the latest changes. For example, it took Cyc six years to collect over one million assertions [97], nevertheless Schubert argues that the actual amount of knowledge needed for open-domain automatic processing http://www.dmoz.org.The list of research papers using, for instance, WordNet seems endless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., cf. http://lit.csci.unt.edu/~wordnet/ and http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/ sim-bib. (d (e ( M vo vo to St w co ve fu co th re th be A 14 th w in W pa w by no so ca of tr Th ( ( (i 8 9 10E. Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 5 should be two or three orders of magnitude greater, which, given the reported progress rate, would require further decades of manual work [179]. ) Coverage. Covering all topics, in order to enable open-domain intelligent processing, cannot be achieved by means of manual input from domain experts. For instance, WordNet provides fine-grained sense distinctions for many common nouns, but does not include information about named entities such as Condoleezza Rice or Theodor W. Adorno,orabout specialized concepts such as cysteine or CYP2E1. Furthermore, manual resources tend to be culturally-biased \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., both Cyc and WordNet contain concepts for George W. Bush and Tony Blair, but no entry for, e.g., their German contemporary counterpart Gerhard Schr\u00c3\u00b6der. ) Up-to-date information. When moving to dynamic domains, such as processing news and other real-time information, knowledge has to be up to date. Since manually annotated resources rely on a limited input provided by domain experts, they cannot provide continuously updated information, e.g., Cyc still identifies Silvio Berlusconi as Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, and refers to his 2001\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2006 government. f) The language barrier. To enable multilingual text processing, knowledge resources need to contain the lexicalizations of their concepts in different languages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., encoding that the sense of bank as financial institute translates as banca, banco and Bank in Italian, Spanish and German, respectively. However, manual input of lexical knowledge implies that the effort needs to be repeated for each language of interest. Moreover, resource-poor languages are typically difficult to cover, due to the limited availability of resources such as lexicons, native speakers, etc. Over the past decade, a variety of proposals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including online collaborative platforms such as MindPixel 8 and Open ind 9 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have tried to overcome these limitations and make manual knowledge acquisition feasible by collecting input from lunteers [170]. This approach has recently been revamped through the framework of human computation proposed by n Ahn, which aims at acquiring knowledge from users by means of online games [7,8]. However, none of these efforts, date, has succeeded in producing truly wide-coverage resources able to compete with standard manual resources. aking out a middle ground with semi-structured resources. Both unstructured and structured resources provide knowledge hich can be successfully exploited for intelligent applications. Furthermore, from a general standpoint, their limitations are mplementary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., manually-assembled, fully-structured resources achieve high quality for lower coverage while, vice rsa, statistical methods applied to unstructured data provide wide coverage for a lower quality. But although a promising ture direction is to combine these two alternatives within a unified framework, in this paper (and special issue) we ncentrate, instead, on semi-structured resources as a solution to the structured vs. unstructured knowledge dilemma. Since eir inception a few years ago, these resources have proved themselves, in fact, to be of a quality on a par with manual sources [61]. High-quality content, in turn, is attained for virtually all domains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus ensuring a wide coverage [76] \u00e2\u20ac\u201con e basis of a collaborative editing model. In the following we focus our survey and discussion on Wikipedia, which is a prime example of this kind of resource, ing, as it is, the largest and most popular collaborative semi-structured resource of world and linguistic knowledge. lthough a great deal of work exists on other resources, such as Wiktionary [221,105,116], Flickr [178,167,183],Twitter[150, 9,164] and Yahoo! Answers [3,20,188], Wikipedia exemplifies all the essential features of this trend of research. Indeed, anks to both its richness and free availability, all contributions contained in this special issue opt for it, choosing from the ide range of collaborative semi-structured resources, as their knowledge source for a variety of tasks (which we introduce the remainder of this paper). To understand the advantages provided by semi-structured, collaborative resources like ikipedia, we now turn to their content and editing model. At its core, Wikipedia consists of a repository of encyclopedic entries (i.e., pages), each about a certain concept. Each ge identifies a specific sense or entity of a nominal phrase: for instance, Mouse refers to the animal sense of mouse, hereas Mouse (computing) describes its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpointing device\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sense. Similarly, homonymous named entities are disambiguated associating them with different pages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., John McCarthy (computer scientist) vs. John McCarthy (linguist). 10 Let us w focus on the Wikipedia page for Alan Turing (Fig. 1), which we will use in the remainder of this paper as our primary urce of examples. Similarly to other encyclopedias, the page provides definitional text from which much information n be extracted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, that Turing was a mathematician, that he is widely considered to be one of the fathers AI, etc. However, what really makes Wikipedia stand out as a goldmine of knowledge is the fact that, in contrast to aditional encyclopedias, its text is partially structured. First, various relations exist between the different kinds of pages. ese include, among others: i) redirection pages: for instance, Turing, Turing, A.M., A.M. Turing and Christopher Morcom all redirect to Alan Turing; ii) internal hyperlinks: Alan Turing links, among many other pages, to Artificial Intelligence, Cryptanalysis, Enigma machine,etc.; ii) interlanguage links: these hyperlinks connect corresponding pages across wikipedias in different languages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., Alan Turing links to the Latin Alanus Mathison Turing and Russian T ring, Alan pages; http://www.mindpixel.com.http://www.openmind.org. Accordingly, in the remainder of this paper we use the terms \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconcept\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcentity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsense\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and (Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcentry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interchangeably. 6(iv to cr m us an th na po in fo re a by W sa no co 11 se seE.

Wikipedia page for Alan Turing. ) category pages: these are used to topically classify encyclopedic entries (e.g., Alan Turing is categorized into MATH- EMATICIANS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE, BRITISH LONG-DISTANCE RUNNERS, etc.) and are further embedded within a hierarchical structure (e.g., MATHEMATICIANS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE is categorized under SCIENTISTS WHO COM- MITTED SUICIDE). In addition, pages can contain infoboxes, namely tables summarizing the most important attributes of the entity referred by a page, such as the birth and death date for a person like Turing. On the one hand, hyperlinks and infobox tables are natural features of a web-based encyclopedia: on the other hand, the ucial aspect here is that markup annotations indirectly encode semantic content and, thus, world and linguistic knowledge anually input by human editors. For instance, categories naturally provide topic labels. Redirections, instead, are typically ed to provide alternative names for a concept, that is, they model (near-)synonymy. Internal links, in turn, provide sense d entity annotations: for instance, the term ciphers within the entry for Alan Turing is linked to Cipher, which describes e algorithmic sense of the word (as opposed to cipher as a name for the number 0). Similarly, an occurrence of the proper me King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College (where Turing was an undergraduate student) is disambiguated, among different entities, by making it int to the entry for King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College, Cambridge (as opposed, for instance, to King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College London). Inter-language links, stead, provide a natural way to capture sense-disambiguated translations. Finally, infoboxes encode both salient attributes r the entity of interest (e.g., the fact that Turing was British, was born in 1912 and died in 1954, etc.), as well as semantic lations (for instance, that Alonzo Church was his doctoral advisor). All this content is provided by human editors on voluntary basis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, Wikipedia has been dubbed as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcencyclopedia that anyone can edit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and quality is achieved massive, collaborative editing and validation. In order to make it possible for users to provide large amounts of world and linguistic knowledge (i.e., annotated data), ikipedia relies on a low entrance barrier: that is, (i) users are encouraged to contribute content which does not neces- rily need to be structured; (ii) this content can be enhanced at any time with manual annotations, which, however, do t necessarily carry any explicit, well-defined semantics. For example, users are encouraged to hyperlink the most relevant ncepts of a page, without explicitly viewing this as a sense or entity annotation process. 11 Similarly, pages and categories http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links. Note that this simple, yet highly accessible, framework can later be extended with a full-fledgedmantic model \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cf. online collaborative platforms like Semantic MediaWiki [93], which extend Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software platform with tools to annotate mantic data within wiki pages. ca ev re tu a co gu st tu sp ( ( (i (i ( (v so ed fr of ho 3. an 3. re bo ce in 12E.

How- er, this thematically organized thesaurus does not necessarily consist of a semantic backbone for the concept repository: lations between Wikipedia categories are, in fact, semantically unspecified and, although methods exist for creating struc- red knowledge resources from their network (see Section 4.2), they do not provide per se a taxonomy or ontology with full-fledged subsumption hierarchy. Thus, the model of Wikipedia (i) relies on large amounts of manually-input knowledge, (ii) provided via massive online llaboration (iii) on the basis of semi-structured (i.e., free-form markup) content which implicitly encodes world and lin- istic knowledge. We crucially argue that this model is able to alleviate, in a substantial way, the problems related to both ructured and unstructured resources. This is achieved by leveraging a middle ground between structured and unstruc- red knowledge sources, thus taking advantage of the strengths of the resources at the two ends of the spectrum. More ecifically: i) Being an encyclopedia, Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content is definitional in nature. It therefore fills the knowledge gap by encoding large amounts of knowledge in an explicit way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., the page about Birds mentions that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost bird species can fly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This in turn calls for the development of knowledge acquisition frameworks which, in contrast to mainstream approaches which typically exploit textual redundancy [50,14], concentrate instead on leveraging definitional text by means, for instance, of definition extraction techniques [142]. ii) Wikipedia is a web of interconnected concepts and named entities, thus showing a high degree of ontologization. In fact, previous work has shown that its concept repository can be used \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas is\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as a semantic network or taxonomy (see [160,162], for instance) or embedded within a larger knowledge base [187,22,139, inter alia]. ii) In the collaborative framework upon which Wikipedia is based, the effort required to create and maintain the knowledge repository is spread across a multitude of users. This is to say, the high quality of its ontologized information is ensured by means of collaborative editing [61]. Each human editor, in fact, contributes his or her expertise by providing knowledge for different topics: while this anonymous crowdsourcing process is not necessarily able to produce an authoritative resource [207], it nevertheless enables scalable and open knowledge management. v) Relying on vast amounts of users makes it possible to achieve a wide coverage for virtually all domains. In fact, thanks to its massive collaborative approach, Wikipedia is able to cover in depth not only domains pertaining to popular culture (e.g., music, movies, etc.) but also very specialized domains such as systems biology or Artificial Intelligence [76]. v) The low entrance barrier and easy accessibility enable a continuously updated content, which is (i) revised to ensure high quality; (ii) kept up-to-date to reflect changes due to recent events. Content revisions, in turn, provide real-world data about how documents are collaboratively edited and revised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., machine-readable records of how sentences and texts evolve through time. i) The Web naturally provides a global environment for the development of a multilingual repository of knowledge. Wikipedia is, again, a prototype par excellence, since it ranks among the largest multilingual resources ever created. Currently, it covers almost 300 languages, ranging from resource-rich ones such as English and Italian to resource-poor ones like Maltese or Yiddish. A multilingual dimension is encoded not only as disambiguated translations (its so-called inter-language links), but also as vast amounts of text which can be exploited, for instance, to create parallel corpora [1]. Thus, semi-structured resources like Wikipedia address the problems associated with unstructured and structured re- urces by bringing together the best of both worlds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, wide coverage and high quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by adopting a collaborative iting model (cf. Fig. 2). In the following sections we corroborate this thesis by presenting an overview of contributions om the literature which lend support to the key arguments listed above. Or, to put it another way, we now turn to a survey contributions which highlight the advantages of using collaboratively-generated semi-structured content, 12 and explain w the papers of this special issue take up this line of research and advance it a step further. Filling the knowledge gap: transforming semi-structured content into machine-readable knowledge In this section we start looking at approaches which extract machine-readable knowledge from semi-structured content d focus on the acquisition of non-ontologized information such as terms and relations between them. 1. Acquiring related terms: thesaurus extraction Thesauri consist of collections of related terms, which are grouped on the basis of their senses (e.g., based on the lexical lations of synonymy and antonymy). Sense information can be straightforwardly obtained from Wikipedia in the form of th a sense inventory (provided by its set of articles) and sense-annotated data (given by its internal links pointing to con- pts and entities with unambiguous labels): consequently, Wikipedia naturally provides a source of data for automatically ducing thesauri.Foracomplementarysurveythereaderisreferredto[112]. 8Fig to ea Sc do as w Al th ta (i) ba to re la co co 3.

Semi-structured resources such as Wikipedia stake out a middle ground between totally unstructured and fully-structured resources, thus bringing gether the best of both worlds on the basis of a collaborative editing model. Nakayama et al. [127] proposed a variety of approaches to automatically construct thesauri from Wikipedia by associating ch sense (i.e., a Wikipedia page) with its most closely related senses. The simplest method is based on previous work by h\u00c3\u00bctze and Pedersen [181] and combines (i) a cosine-based scoring function and (ii) a vector space representation of cuments, with (iii) a variant of the widely-used tf *idf measure defined using Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hyperlinks. This computes the sociation strength between two pages by multiplying the number of times a specific internal link occurs within a page (tf ) ith the log-scaled inverse number of documents containing that same link (idf ). For instance, the relatedness between an Turing and Artificial Intelligence is computed by counting the number of times the latter occurs as a link within e former, multiplied by the inverse number of Wikipedia pages which link to Artificial Intelligence. A more complex association measure, named pf *ibf, instead, takes into account the entire structure of the graph ob- ined from Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal links. To compute the association strength between articles, this scoring function combines the path frequency (pf ), namely the number of paths between articles (each weighted by its length), with (ii) an inverse ckward link frequency factor (ibf ), which quantifies the specificity of a sense in terms of the number of backward links its corresponding article. However, the high accuracy of pf *ibf comes at the cost of a high computational load, since it quires the computation of all paths between all pairs of articles in a very large graph. To resolve this, the same authors ter presented a more efficient approach [79] which combines tf *idf vectors with second-order co-occurrence vectors [180] mputed over Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hyperlinks, and achieves a performance comparable with pf *ibf for a much lower computational st. 2. Relation extraction We now look at approaches which are aimed at establishing relations between entities in text \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., Alan Turing born-in ndon, worked-at Bletchley Park, etc. As in the case of thesaurus acquisition, we find that semi-structured content from ikipedia provides large amounts of high-quality data for this task, in terms of both plain text and annotated linguistic ta. A first approach, proposed by Ruiz-Casado et al. [174], collects relations between entities by analyzing the definitional ntences found in the Simple English Wikipedia. 13 From these sentences, contexts containing hyperlinks are first collected d generalized on the basis of edit distance measure and part-of-speech constraints; then, in a second step, these gen- alized patterns are used to harvest novel relations. Based on an automatic mapping between WordNet and Wikipedia ee Section 4.1), these relations are used to enrich WordNet with novel semantically typed is-a and part-of links between nsets. An alternative approach to relation extraction which leverages Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infoboxes was presented by Wu and eld [212], who proposed to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcautonomously semantify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Wikipedia by creating new infoboxes and completing others with no plicit supervision. To this end, their system, named Kylin, leverages the shallow structure contained within Wikipedia to tomatically induce supervised information extractors. Given a Wikipedia page, a document preprocessor parses the page\u00e2\u20ac\u2122shttp://simple.wikipedia.org. in co Th (i gi ex au m en w an ex m su se to Ta an W co po to 4. in m to a in cu in st 4. as in of va to re Fl pr on sy st Ba in m In in 14 diE.

Then, ven a new Wikipedia page, these classifiers are used to identify sentences which potentially contain attributes, and to tract specific attribute-value pairs from them. The result is a self-supervised system which gathers training examples and tomatically learns a set of relation extractors. Self-supervision is achieved by synergistically exploiting two of Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ain characteristics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, structured annotations in the form of table-formatted data (i.e., infoboxes) and free-form cyclopedic text. Matching structured annotations from infoboxes with free-form text to automatically generate labeled relational data as subsequently developed in a variety of different directions. Wu and Weld [213] learn relation-independent extractors, d combine them within TextRunner [14], in order to boost its performance. The results show that an open information traction system can benefit greatly from a general-purpose, self-supervised extractor using dependency parse-level infor- ation (thus supporting related findings from Nguyen et al. [145]). Another extension is to enrich the feature set of Kylin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pervised relation extractors by means of Web-harvested lexicons [75], thus generalizing over lexical features. Finally, this lf-supervised framework can be applied to the task of matching infoboxes from wikipedias in different languages, in order perform cross-lingual resource mapping and integration [2]. ke-home message 1. Although their output is relatively low-level from a semantic standpoint, methods for thesaurus d relation extraction introduce us to a leitmotif \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, generating semantics by exploiting the shallow structure found in ikipedia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which we will encounter frequently in the remainder of this article. This simple, yet powerful idea is, in fact, mmon to the majority of approaches that are going to be reviewed in the following sections. Its applicability is made ssible by the high quality and quantity of the collaboratively-generated, manually-curated input, which requires less noise lerance compared to, for instance, processing Web text. Degrees of ontologization: building and enriching ontologies from semi-structured content In this section we look at resources which are created from collaboratively-generated, semi-structured content and, contrast to thesauri and repositories of relational knowledge, provide truly semantic information, i.e., they encode se- antic relations between disambiguated concepts and entities. These include taxonomies, as well as their generalization fully-structured knowledge models, i.e., ontologies. Exploiting semi-structured content to build ontologized resources is well-explored line of research, and is taken a step further by the two papers on YAGO2 [73] and WikiNet [130] included this special issue, as well as by recent work on BabelNet [139], among others. We accordingly devote a detailed dis- ssion to it. First, in Section 4.1, we look at approaches integrating semi-structured with structured information. Next, Section 4.2, we consider taxonomic and ontological resources built by transforming semi-structured content into fully ructured knowledge bases. 1. Integrating semi-structured and structured knowledge repositories A first step towards ontologization can be achieved by integrating semi-structured content with structured resources, provided, for instance, by existing taxonomies and semantic networks such as WordNet and Cyc. 14 To perform this tegration the most accurate solution consists of using manual input from human experts (similarly to the general scenario constructing knowledge resources, cf. Section 2). For instance, DBPedia [22] provides a knowledge base interlinked with rious other Web resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including, e.g., a manual mapping of Wikipedia entries to WordNet concepts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c according the Linked Data principle [21]. However, due to its high costs and limited scalability, a manual approach needs to be placed or complemented with automatic methods, to which we now turn. at representations: vector similarity and heuristic mapping. One of the first proposals for mapping Wikipedia to WordNet was esented by Ruiz-Casado et al. [173], who proposed associating Wikipedia pages with their most similar WordNet synsets the basis of the similarity between their respective bags-of-words representations. Their method represents pages and nsets in a vector space model (using the pages\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 content and glosses, respectively) and computes their similarity using andard vector distance metrics such as, e.g., cosine or the dot product. An approach used in later work to construct belNet [138,139], a very large multilingual network combining WordNet and Wikipedia, achieves good performance by tersecting these bags-of-words. In contrast to using bags-of-words and vector space representations, Suchanek et al. [187] ade use of the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost frequent sense\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 heuristic typically used in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD, [132,133]). order to build the YAGO ontology, they proposed unifying Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s category system with WordNet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxonomy by link- g each Wikipedia category to a WordNet synset. To this end, categories whose label consists of complex noun phrases (e.g.,Note that many of the approaches presented here are in fact part of larger proposals aimed at producing unified knowledge bases: consequently the scussion overlaps with many of the contributions presented later in Section 4.2. 10 M no (t a H PL th Su ap ta W w gl ap no a W a of Pa by Ex m se us W us Po de ov ta Th by in fra su Ta tu a w W 4. st an Ta ca ne be us go on taE.

Next, in order to establish the actual mapping, each category is associated with he synset containing) the sense of its label: in the case that more than one such synset exists (i.e., the label consists of polysemous word), a link is established with the sense which is most frequent in SemCor [119], a sense-labeled corpus. owever, the most frequent heuristic can lead to many spurious mappings (e.g., linking the botanical Wikipedia category ANTS to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindustrial plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sense of plant): consequently, later work from Ponzetto and Navigli showed how to improve is simple approach by means of a structure-based mapping algorithm [156]. pervised and ensemble methods. As in the case of many complex tasks and applications, an alternative to unsupervised proaches consists of adopting supervised methods that make use of labeled data. These were explored for the mapping sk by de Melo and Weikum in the construction of MENTA [114], a multilingual taxonomy which integrates WordNet and ikipedia (Section 7). Their supervised model is induced from a set of manually-labeled mappings using features such as ord-level information (term overlap between sets of synonyms and redirections, cosine similarity between the vector of osses), as well as YAGO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most frequent sense heuristic (used here as a soft constraint, instead). Adopting a supervised proach for resource mapping has the advantage of yielding competitive results. However, as a trade-off, this approach is t applicable to arbitrary resources where no manually-labeled mappings are available for training. Toral et al. [193] investigated a variety of methods for mapping Wikipedia categories to WordNet synsets, including textual entailment system, knowledge-based semantic similarity (computed by applying Personalized PageRank [4] to the ordNet graph), as well as distributional methods [210]. While most methods achieve a performance comparable with baseline mapping using SemCor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most frequent sense, substantial improvements are obtained by combining the output these methods using a voting strategy or a supervised learner. Similar findings on using and combining Personalized geRank with cosine similarity for the different, yet strongly related, task of mapping Wikipedia pages were later presented Niemann and Gurevych [146]. ploiting structure. Since Wikipedia provides semi-structured content, its structured features can also be exploited for the apping task. Similarly to Ruiz-Casado et al., Medelyan and Legg [111] also integrated Cyc with Wikipedia by finding the mantically closest mappings. However, instead of relying on a flat vector representation, they quantified semantic distances ing a relatedness measure computed on the Wikipedia hyperlink graph [120]. Toral et al. [195], instead, proposed linking ikipedia to WordNet by finding categories and synsets which have the maximum overlap in terms of instances, that is, ing structural evidence, but only from the lowest hierarchical level. A full-fledged graph-based method was presented by nzetto and Navigli [156], who associated categories from WikiTaxonomy [162] with those synsets which have the highest gree of structural overlap (computed against WordNet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxonomy). Using a graph-based technique is found to improve er the most frequent sense heuristic by a large margin: the mapping, in turn, can be used to restructure the Wikipedia xonomy, in order to improve its quality by increasing its degree of alignment with the reference resource (i.e., WordNet). e advantages of a structural approach to resource mapping were further investigated in the construction of BabelNet Navigli and Ponzetto [139], who performed a side-to-side comparison of a bag-of-words method, originally developed [138,157], with a graph-based approach. To provide a fair comparison, the two methods were evaluated within the same mework (i.e., to estimate the probability of a mapping), and the graph-based approach was consistently found to be perior in that it displayed a much higher recall for comparable precision. ke-home message 2. Rather than representing knowledge sources that are mutually exclusive, semi-structured and struc- red resources are complementary to each other. In order to produce a unified, fully-ontologized resource, one needs to define mapping procedure: the best methods for this task (i.e., highest-performing and requiring minimal supervision) are those hich take into account structural features of the input resources, such as Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hyperlink and category graphs, and ordNet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concept hierarchy. 2. Semantifying unstructured and semi-structured content: taxonomy and ontology induction An alternative to integrating fully-structured knowledge sources with semi-structured information is to take semi- ructured resources and build knowledge bases directly from them. In this section we look at approaches to taxonomy d ontology induction based on Wikipedia, and focus on the advantages of using semi-structured resources for this task. xonomy induction: WikiTaxonomy. One of the first proposals for automatically acquiring a taxonomic resource from the tegory system of Wikipedia was presented by Ponzetto and Strube [159,155,161]. Their method starts with the category twork \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas-is\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (namely, with semantically unspecified relations between its categories, cf. Fig. 3(a)) and labels the relations tween categories as is-a or not-is-a, thus producing a taxonomy as output (Fig. 3(b)). Semantic relations are established ing a cascade of heuristics, which consider (i) the syntactic structure of the category labels, (ii) the topology of the cate- ry network, and (iii) the application of lexico-syntactic patterns for detecting subsumption and meronymy relations (based the original work of Hearst [71] and Berland and Charniak [18], respectively). These three approaches are complemen-ry: while specializations such as MATHEMATICIANS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE is-a MATHEMATICIANS can be acquired Fi tra by fo SU m m co in th no no an by in O it co a W re ag th in co to fr la an Tu th im 19 in ar qu (e ed kn co m fo la fuE. Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 11 g. 3. Inducing taxonomic relations between categories in Wikipedia. Starting from the network of categories of Wikipedia, WikiTaxonomy is generated by versing the network and deciding for each pair of categories whether the sub-category isa a super-category. means of a syntactic analysis of the category names, the last two types of method (i.e., (ii) and (iii)) generate more in- rmative relations like, for instance, that MATHEMATICIANS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE is-a SCIENTISTS WHO COMMITTED ICIDE. The result is a large scale taxonomy containing hundreds of thousands of is-a relations. Evaluation of this auto- atically generated resource, named WikiTaxonomy, shows that it compares favorably in quality and coverage with existing anually created taxonomies such as WordNet and Cyc. In comparison with manually constructed resources, WikiTaxonomy ntains a large amount of additional information such as, for instance, domain taxonomies covering very specialized areas the fields of arts, business, fashion, etc. Furthermore, thanks to Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common structure across different languages, e framework can be applied to wikipedias in languages other than English such as, e.g., German [84],toacquiretaxo- mic knowledge for other languages. Finally, while WikiTaxonomy is built upon a definition of the is-a relation which does t distinguish between subsumption (i.e., a concept-to-concept strict specialization/generalization) and instantiation (i.e., entity-to-concept class membership) relations, this layer of information can be added later in a second stage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as shown Zirn et al. [222], who also developed a cascade of heuristics to further specialize WikiTaxonomy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations into is-a and stance-of. ntology acquisition: WikiNet, YAGO and DBPedia. Despite the fact that they typically form the backbone of structured repos- ories of knowledge, taxonomies contain only is-a relations. Instead, the range of semantic relations that can hold between ncepts is far larger \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., meronymy (part-of ) or even domain-specific relations (e.g., the is-advisor-of relation between faculty academic and his or her students). To harvest such relations, Nastase and Strube [129] proposed building upon ikiTaxonomy and transforming it into a full-fledged semantic network by taking all category pairs labeled with a not-is-a lation, and specifying their semantics with more fine-grained relations such as part-of, located-in, etc. These are generated, ain, by employing heuristics which look at the syntactic structure of the category labels, as well as at the connectivity in e category network. Part of this approach is also integrated in the construction of WikiNet described in this special issue the paper by Nastase and Strube [130]. An alternative approach to building a full-fledged ontology from semi-structured content is used for YAGO [187].YAGO nsists of a wide-coverage semantic network which is automatically derived from Wikipedia and WordNet. Similarly WikiTaxonomy and its extensions, it is built by means of a number of heuristics applied to semi-structured content om Wikipedia (e.g., infoboxes and categories), which is combined with taxonomic relations from WordNet. YAGO popu- tes WordNet with millions of entities from Wikipedia by means of: (i) a simple, yet powerful, heuristic which assigns instance-of relation to entities corresponding to Wikipedia pages and their (property-denoting) categories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., Alan ring instance-of BRITISH LONG-DISTANCE RUNNERS; (ii) a mapping from Wikipedia categories to WordNet synsets on e basis of SemCor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most frequent sense (Section 4.1). Other category-specific heuristics parse category labels and extract plicit relations between nominals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for instance, from the category 1954 Deaths one can derive that Alan Turing died-in 54. Similar heuristics are also applied to the attribute-value pairs found within infoboxes in order to generate additional formation (e.g., from death_place=[[Wilmslow]] it is possible to acquire Turing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place of death). All these relations e integrated within a unified knowledge base using an RDFS-like formalism, and are accessed by means of a dedicated ery language. In recent years YAGO has enjoyed a wide interest and has been used for a variety of intelligent applications .g., IBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Watson [57]): in this special issue, Hoffart et al. [73] present recent work which aims at taking this knowl- ge base to the next level by enriching it with spatial and temporal knowledge [72],inorderthatitcanbeappliedto owledge-intensive tasks requiring such knowledge types. A parallel effort, similar in spirit to YAGO, is DBPedia [22], the goal of which is also to transform the semi-structured ntent of Wikipedia into a fully-structured representation using RDF, a Semantic Web language, as the underlying for- alism. To this end, DBPedia builds upon a cascade of parsers to extract information from a variety of different elements und within Wikipedia pages, including redirects, inter-language links, categories, as well as infoboxes. The result is a very rge ontology containing tens of millions of RDF statements. In contrast to YAGO, however, the focus of this project is onlly structuring information already present within pages, rather than acquiring novel, or abstracting existing, information. 12 In ot A tu st si w ve in am w fu Ta sc lig of 5. a fro ph m le 5.1 lin ta (W Na Th in se gr re an m ar (1 th th fo a 15 16 17 18 is 19E.

All approaches to taxonomy and ontology acquisition that we have seen in this section create struc- red knowledge repositories by means of heuristic approaches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c arguably, an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoffbeat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tendency which contrasts with atistical approaches being the de-facto standard framework for work in knowledge acquisition. Each individual method is mple in nature, focuses on a specific characteristic of Wikipedia (e.g., the syntactic structure of the category labels, or the ay categories and pages are connected within a hyperlink graph), and in combination these methods are able to produce ry large resources with millions of concepts and semantic relations between them. In general, what is really interesting this simple, yet powerful, heuristic approach is that it can be seen as a natural consequence of the availability of large ounts of high-quality semi-structured content. All the aforementioned heuristics, in fact, perform well because they start ith content that is already meaningfully structured (i.e., Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pages and categories), and need \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make it lly-structured by augmenting it with overt semantic information. ke-home message 3. High-quality, semi-structured content enables the acquisition of machine-readable knowledge on a large ale by means of heuristic methods which essentially leverage regularities found within their shallow structure. That is, htweight and scalable rule-based approaches can be devised to exploit the conventions governing the editorial base collaboratively-generated resources, and capture large amounts of semantic information hidden within them. Getting serious about semi-structured resources: exploiting collaboratively-generated knowledge The availability of very large amounts of knowledge for many domains naturally invites, demands even, its use on wide range of tasks. Accordingly, in this section, we present an overview of approaches aimed at leveraging knowledge m collaboratively-generated, semi-structured content for intelligent applications. To this end, we progressively look at enomena of increasing complexity. We start in Section 5.1 with lexical semantic tasks concerned with modeling the eaning of words and phrases. Next, in Section 5.2 we look at high-end tasks which go beyond the word and sentence vel, such as text categorization, Question Answering and Information Retrieval applications. . Understanding words and phrases We first consider contributions which exploit semi-structured information for lexical semantic analysis. For this purpose, guistic knowledge encoded within Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structure has been found to be beneficial for several lexical understanding sks, among which we focus here on Named Entity (NE) recognition and disambiguation, Word Sense Disambiguation SD), and computing semantic relatedness. med Entity Recognition. Named entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying mentions of named entities (NEs) in text. e task of recognizing NEs is a well-known problem in NLP (see [126] for a survey) and it has attracted a lot of interest recent years, since information about NEs can benefit a variety of high-end applications such as, for instance, Web arch [12]. Typically, the NER task consists of identifying mentions in running text and classifying them into coarse- ained semantic classes such as, for instance, PERSON, LOCATION and ORGANIZATION.SinceWikipediaisaverylarge pository of information that is focused primarily on NEs, it has been exploited for automatically generating labeled data d improving performance on NER. A first proposal for harvesting structured information about entities was presented by Toral and Mu\u00c3\u00b1oz [194].Their ethod extracts a gazetteer using the first sentence found on each Wikipedia page and relies on the fact that such sentences e typically definitional in nature. 18 For instance, given a sentence like: ) Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS (23 June 1912\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 June 1954), was an English mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. e method is able to extract the information that Alan Turing is an instance of a PERSON. It achieves this by: (i) extracting e genus phrase from the sentence (mathematician, in this case), (ii) mapping it to its first sense in WordNet and (iii) llowing the is-a hierarchy until a synset denoting a named entity class is encountered (mathematician 1 n is-a scientist 1 n is- person 1 n , 19 which in turn corresponds to the NE class PERSON). Similarly to the knowledge acquisition scenario from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook. http://www.freebase.com. http://www.opencyc.org. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The article should begin with a short declarative sentence, answering two questions for the nonspecialist reader: What (or who) is the subject? and Whythis subject notable?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, extracted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles. We denote WordNet senses with w i p ,namelythei-th sense of a word w with part of speech p.

Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 13 ction 4.2, this approach shows that large amounts of knowledge about NEs can be harvested by complementing semi- ructured content with simple rules leveraging regularities in the annotations it contains. This semantic class information om Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitional sentences was later used by Kazama and Torisawa [85] as a feature for a supervised named tity recognizer. Improvements on a standard benchmarking dataset for this task [191] confirm the benefits of using zetteer information mined from Wikipedia. As we will see in this section in respect of a variety of tasks, the leitmotif of approaches to lexical semantic analysis ploiting Wikipedia is that they each leverage semi-structured data as semantic annotations. For instance, given a gazetteer here Turing is classified as an instance of PERSON, it is possible to label occurrences of internal links to the page Alan ring such as the following: ) The study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer, based on the work of mathematician Alan Turing and others. instances of an entity of type PERSON in context. Using Wikipedia as a source of NE annotated data has been investigated a variety of papers, including those of Mika et al. [118], who use attribute-value pairs found in infoboxes, and Nothman al. [147], who instead classify Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s articles into NE semantic classes and label occurrences of internal links with the ass label (as in our example). The classification of a Wikipedia entry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., identifying that the Wikipedia page Alan Turing fers to an entity of class PERSON \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can, in its turn, be performed in a number of ways. This includes using a manual t of keywords [171], a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach [147], or a supervised classifier using annotations from ikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bullet lists [206] or infoboxes [45]. The topic of automatically generating NE labeled data from Wikipedia and eir extrinsic evaluation within a NER system is explored in detail in the article by Nothman et al. [148] included in this ecial issue. amed Entity disambiguation. In order for the meaning of an NE to be fully modeled, it not only needs to be recognized in xt, but also to be associated with its appropriate reference. For instance, the phrase Tu r i n g in these two sentences: ) A number of the university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faculty and students have also gained prominence in the field of computing sciences. Examples include [. . . ] Ric Holt, co-creator of several programming languages, most notably Turing. ) Turing was played by Derek Jacobi, who also played in a 1996 television adaptation of the play. fers to two different entities, namely the programming language vs. the British mathematician. The task of linking occur- nces of ambiguous names with their corresponding NEs is referred to in the literature as named entity disambiguation. Initial work on named entity disambiguation using Wikipedia as a source of entity-annotated data was presented by nescu and Pas\u00c2\u00b8ca [30], who proposed viewing internal links as named entity annotations which define a link between proper name in context (Tu r i n g , for instance) and the entity to which it refers, as given by its target Wikipedia page .g., Turing (programming language) or Alan Turing). Bunescu and Pas\u00c2\u00b8ca used this labeled data to build a model that aps each NE context and Wikipedia page to a vector space and links a proper name in context with the entity-denoting ge which has maximal cosine similarity. Error analysis of the cosine-based ranking method shows that it suffers from e general limitations of the vector space model, i.e., it is not able to capture synonymy and does not cope with short or complete contexts. To provide a richer representation, feature vectors representing the contexts were therefore augmented ith information quantifying the correlation between contexts and Wikipedia categories. This improved representation, mbined with a disambiguation kernel, outperforms the vector space model and crucially demonstrates the beneficial effect including category information from Wikipedia. The benefits of structural features mined from Wikipedia were further monstrated in the subsequent work of Dredze et al. [51], where the performance of a supervised classifier is further osted by including additional features derived from the Wikipedia hyperlink graph, such as the indegree/outdegree of entity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wikipedia page, as well as the page length in bytes. Later contributions continued to build upon the idea of using Wikipedia as a repository of textual data containing a large antity of annotated entities. Cucerzan [42] presented an unsupervised approach based on a vector space model, which intly disambiguates all mentions of named entities within a document by assuming that entities referred to within a doc- ent must be related to each other. For instance, an occurrence of Java and Sun within the same document helps these o proper names to mutually disambiguate each other as referring, respectively, to the programming language and the mpany. This better disambiguation strategy is achieved, similarly to [30], by using information from Wikipedia categories enrich the context vector representations of NE mentions. The benefits of a joint model that disambiguates all entities gether were thereafter demonstrated with a wide range of algorithms, including simple hill-climbing and integer linear ogramming [94], as well as a graph-based algorithm combining syntactic and semantic compatibility information [74]. detailed analysis of the task of entity disambiguation, including a systematic comparison of different state-of-the-art ap- oaches and the most important factors affecting the performance of the systems, is presented in this special issue in the ticle by Hachey et al. [67]. ord Sense Disambiguation. While NE disambiguation is concerned with linking mentions of entities with their referents,ord Sense Disambiguation (WSD, [132,133]) aims at identifying the meaning of words in context. For this task knowledge 14 m pe ni w fo (5 (6 in M pr w co se th co am to se W pl w id an ki bi th m ho by N at fro in Th in w Ta ph di Co od pr in gr pu 20E. Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 ined from semi-structured resources like Wikipedia has been shown to be beneficial both in a supervised and an unsu- rvised setting. Mihalcea [117] proposed a method for automatically generating sense-tagged data which, similarly to work in NE recog- tion and disambiguation, views internal hyperlinks as linguistic annotations encoding lexico-semantic information, i.e., ord sense annotations, in this case. For instance, two Wikipedia links anchored on the same word fellow are used in the llowing sentences to identify two different senses, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmember of a learned society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vs. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccolleague\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. ) In 1935, at the young age of 22, Turing was elected a fellow at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem. ) In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived By mapping Wikipedia articles to WordNet senses, hyperlinked text like these two example sentences can be transformed to standard sense-labeled data for use in WSD, which typically draws on WordNet as sense inventory [184,137].Thus, ihalcea was able to automatically create sense-annotated data on the basis of a manual mapping: these data were then ovided as input to a machine learning WSD system for predicting the senses of words in unseen text. This approach as shown to improve the performance over the standard SemCor most frequent sense baseline [132],aswellasamore mplex approach based on the Lesk algorithm [99]. An alternative approach aimed at exploiting knowledge from Wikipedia for a knowledge-based WSD system was pre- nted instead by Navigli and Ponzetto [139,157]. This approach maps Wikipedia pages to WordNet (cf. Section 4.1), enriches e latter with topical relations from the former, and uses this enriched knowledge base to perform graph-based WSD using ntext degree disambiguation [136]. Knowledge from Wikipedia is shown to be beneficial for knowledge-rich lexical dis- biguation: when injected into WordNet, this knowledge, in fact, makes it possible for knowledge-based WSD algorithms compete with the best performing approaches for this task, i.e., supervised systems, in a coarse-grained and multilingual tting, as well as to outperform them on domain-specific text. ikification: bringing entity and Word Sense Disambiguation together. An attempt to bring together the (different, yet com- ementary) entity and Word Sense Disambiguation tasks is provided by the so-called task of wikification. In a nutshell, ikification combines keyword extraction with lexical disambiguation: given an input document, a wikification system entifies the most important terms in the document and links (i.e., disambiguates) them to their appropriate entries within external encyclopedic resource, i.e., typically Wikipedia. Csomai and Mihalcea [41] presented the first approach of this nd, in which an unsupervised keyword extraction algorithm using statistics drawn from Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal links is com- ned with the Lesk-like and supervised disambiguators presented by Mihalcea [117].InlaterworkbyCourseyetal.[40], is method, named Wikify!, was applied in order to semantically tag arbitrary documents and automatically extract their ost relevant topics using an unsupervised graph-based approach. Wikification is a very active area of research, arguably because the ability to link documents can have a high impact on w vast amounts of online text, i.e. Web resources, can be structured automatically. The interest in this task is reflected the popularity of community-driven shared tasks, such as the TAC Knowledge Base Population Track [110,80] and the TCIR-9 Cross-Lingual Link Discovery Task, 20 which are two different kinds of wikification competitions: the former is aimed benchmarking the performance of systems in linking mentions of entities in text to entries of a knowledge base built m Wikipedia, the latter, instead, is focused on the ability of systems to generate cross-lingual links between wikipedias different languages. This heightened interest in wikification is also clearly apparent in two papers of this special issue. e Wikipedia Miner toolkit from Milne and Witten [122] makes the supervised wikification system originally presented [121] freely available, while Tonelli et al. [192] present instead the Wiki Machine, a high-performance wikification system hich is shown to outperform Wikipedia Miner thanks to a state-of-the-art kernel-based WSD algorithm [62]. ke-home message 4. Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal links can be viewed as linguistic annotations of the meaning associated with nominal rases referring to word senses or named entities. These sense annotations, in turn, can be used to train state-of-the-art sambiguation models of lexical meaning in context, i.e., named entity, Word Sense Disambiguation or wikification systems. mputing semantic relatedness. Recent years have seen a great deal of work on computing semantic relatedness, i.e., meth- s for automatically quantifying the strength of association between words. This is arguably because semantic relatedness ovides a valuable model of semantic compatibility that can be embedded within a wide range of applications, includ- g, among others, information retrieval [58], Word Sense Disambiguation [152], coreference resolution [158], short answer ading [124], and paraphrase detection [196]. Thanks to its multi-faceted semi-structure, Wikipedia has been drawn upon in a variety of different ways for com- ting semantic relatedness. Among the first such contributions was the WikiRelate! method developed by Ponzetto andhttp://ntcir.nii.ac.jp/CrossLink.

Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 15 rube [185,160], who used Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s category network to compute semantic relatedness by applying a variety of mea- res that had previously been developed for computing semantic relatedness exploiting lexical resources such as WordNet. e results show that, although Wikipedia outperforms WordNet on datasets modeling semantic relatedness such as the ordSimilarity-353 Test Collection [58], its performance on computing semantic similarity (i.e., a tighter notion of semantic mpatibility) is nevertheless lower. This was because approaches for measuring semantic similarity that rely on lexical sources typically use paths based only on is-a relations [25]. Therefore, in later work [159,162] Ponzetto and Strube used eir own WikiTaxonomy (Section 4.2) as a resource and applied the same measures as those used by WikiRelate! to com- te semantic similarity using the is-a paths found in WikiTaxonomy. The results show that using the Wikipedia taxonomy akes it possible to outperform WordNet also on those datasets designed specifically for computing semantic similarity. An alternative to using a structured representation such as Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s category network is offered by distributional ethods [208,197]. Gabrilovich and Markovitch [59,60] introduced a method, called Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), which mputes semantic relatedness on the basis of a vector space of concepts built from Wikipedia. The core idea behind ESA that, given an input document, this document can be represented as a vector whose elements measure the strength association between it and all other documents in a collection. Given a collection of documents such as Wikipedia, here each entry represents a disambiguated concept, the vector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elements can thus be taken to quantify the strength of sociation between the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words and explicit concepts grounded within a semantic space. ESA offers a general trieval model which has been analyzed in depth (see, e.g., [10]) and has been used for a variety of applications. The iginal results from Gabrilovich and Markovitch [59] showed that it enabled state-of-the-art performance on computing mantic relatedness between arbitrary text fragments (i.e., words or documents). Later work on ESA included its application a variety of tasks such as text categorization [60] and semantic information retrieval [52], as well as extensions to include ditional levels of information like, for instance, temporal information mined from Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revision history [166]. One of the limitations of both WikiRelate! and ESA is that they do not exploit one of Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest features, mely, its hyperlink graph. Two approaches which fill this gap were presented in later work by Milne and Witten [120] d Yeh et al. [218]. Milne and Witten [120] compared a tf *idf -like measure computed on Wikipedia links with a more re- ed link co-occurrence measure modeled after the Normalized Google Distance [37]. Their findings indicate that exploiting e topology of the hyperlink graph yields a cheap, yet competitive, semantic relatedness measure. Yeh et al. [218],in- ead, exploited Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structure by computing semantic relatedness using a random walk algorithm, i.e., Personalized geRank [70], on a graph derived from Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hyperlinks, infoboxes and categories. Their best results, obtained by mbining information from categories and infoboxes, indicate that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by lever- ing multiple features from Wikipedia at the same time. However, using internal links only is found to degrade the overall rformance: this is because these links represent many different types of semantic relation with different levels of strength association \u00e2\u20ac\u201c therefore, their richness needs to be combined with other resources and a robust weighting scheme. Using ndom walk algorithms for computing semantic relatedness is a very active area of research: when applied to Wikipedia, is approach is able, in fact, to exploit its structure (e.g., the internal link and category graphs) within a sound statistical amework. In this special issue, the paper by Yazdani and Popescu-Belis [216] explores the application of a random walk gorithm for computing semantic relatedness using Wikipedia. ke-home message 5. Wikipedia contains various different facets of semi-structured content, including disambiguated concepts, ternal links and categories, all of which can be used for computing the strength of association between concepts and word senses .e., semantic relatedness) on the basis of vector space and graph-based representations. 2. Language processing beyond the sentence level Knowledge mined from collaboratively constructed resources can be used to perform tasks which go beyond the level words and their surrounding local context (i.e., sentences, typically). In this section we review approaches which exploit owledge from semi-structured resources for high-end tasks such as document clustering, text categorization, Question nswering and Information Retrieval applications. ocument clustering and text categorization. Documents can overlap in terms of domain, topic, entities they describe, their lations, etc. As a consequence, a first level of document understanding consists of either assigning documents a domain topic label, or grouping them together on the basis of common features. These are two well-known tasks referred to in e literature as text categorization [182] and document clustering [33], respectively. Knowledge mined from collaboratively-constructed resources has been successfully applied to both tasks. Banerjee al. [13] show that performance on document clustering of news feeds can be improved by enriching their bag-of-words presentation with the label of disambiguated concepts, i.e., the title of Wikipedia pages, which are related to the input ort text. Hu et al. [78] proposed, instead, representing documents with a multi-level representation consisting of a con- nt (i.e., bag-of-words) vector and concept vectors built from Wikipedia pages and categories. These vector representations e then combined and exploited to perform clustering by means of a variety of approaches (i.e., agglomerative vs. parti- onal) on the basis of their similarity. The results consistently show that information from Wikipedia categories gives the st improvements over the bag-of-words baseline, and that the best overall results can be achieved by combining it withge-level information. 16 w W w cl by in ca re by In Ta re ef Qu ex en st m of po of cl by pu fro by ap w w a ap nu th ac An qu in us an fro In ra m in sc ra co in an te 21 22 23E. Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 The results from both Banerjee et al. [13] and Hu et al. [78] show the usefulness of going beyond the simple bag-of- ords model by including in the vector representation of texts features that explicitly model disambiguated concepts from ikipedia. Indeed, this very same line of research has been successfully investigated for the task of text categorization, here improvements have been achieved by mapping documents onto semantic spaces in order to perform a more robust assification. One of the first such proposals was presented by Wang and Domeniconi [204], who represented documents means of a semantic kernel which incorporates background knowledge from Wikipedia. Gabrilovich and Markovitch [60], stead, demonstrated the benefits of using ESA to represent documents in an explicit semantic space, prior to the classifi- tion step, whereas Wang et al. [205] explored the usefulness of expanding the bag-of-words representation with semantic lations from a thesaurus automatically constructed from Wikipedia. Recently, graph-based methods have been exploited Navigli et al. [135] in order to perform document-level categorization jointly with term-level lexical disambiguation. all cases, leveraging semantic features from Wikipedia is shown to boost performance in the classification task. ke-home message 6. Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-structured content can be used as a source of semantic information to enrich document presentations and thus go beyond the simple bag-of-words model. These semantically rich representations, in turn, are more fective on, and improve performance on, document-level tasks such as text clustering and classification. estion Answering. The ability to answer questions is a natural benchmark for knowledge resources and methods which ploit them. Large amounts of curated knowledge, in fact, lie at the core of state-of-the-art Question Answering (QA) gines such as Wolfram Alpha 21 and TrueKnowledge, 22 while it is true to say that state-of-the-art QA approaches in general rive for wide-coverage content with a rich structure. Initial work on knowledge-based QA was concentrated on using anually-constructed knowledge repositories (e.g., WordNet-based query expansion [77]). However, the limited coverage these resources soon led researchers to turn to the Web, whose huge amounts of textual data, although noisy, make it ssible to acquire knowledge encoded within surface patterns on a large scale [168]. Wikipedia has been used in a variety of papers as a source of knowledge in order to overcome both the limited coverage manual resources and the lower-than-human quality of knowledge automatically acquired from the Web. Although ency- opedic content is particularly beneficial for definitional questions (i.e., such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat is X?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwho is X?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), as highlighted the findings of Lita et al. [100], Wikipedia has also been used for tackling other QA tasks. Ahn et al. [5] use it as a cor- s in order to extract answers to both factoid questions and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 questions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., interesting information about a topic m a target corpus that was not explicitly asked for in the factoid question [201]. Later work took this one step further leveraging its structure with emphasis on the category system. Ahn et al. [6] used category labels as queries to find propriate supporting documents in the target corpus for an input topic. Buscaldi and Rosso [31] matched input questions ith Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s categories to collect candidate answers among their pages. An approach aimed, instead, at query expansion as presented by MacKinnon and Vechtomova [101], who used Wikipedia for Complex Interactive Question Answering [87], QA task where systems are required to return information nuggets for an input topic, rather than entities or facts. Their proach leverages the anchor text of Wikipedia links as a source of expansion terms for improving the retrieval of relevant ggets. Recently, IBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Watson [57] has renewed community-wide interest in QA by achieving human-level performance in e Jeopardy! game 23 : among its sources of content this state-of-the-art system combines the automatic corpus-based quisition of text nuggets with wide-coverage information from Wikipedia contained in DBPedia and YAGO (Section 4.2). in-depth analysis presented by Chu-Carroll and Fan [35] shows that the lexical answer types (namely the terms in the estion that indicate the type of the entity to be returned) found in Jeopardy! questions are more fine-grained that those TREC [202]: in order to fill the performance gap observed between datasets, they proposed mining candidate answers ing anchor text and redirects metadata from Wikipedia documents. In this special issue, the paper on YAGO2 [73] includes extrinsic evaluation of the quality of this knowledge base on the challenging task of answering spatio-temporal questions m the GeoCLEF 2008 GiKiP Pilot [177] and Jeopardy!. formation Retrieval. Thanks to its repository of disambiguated concepts and its semi-structured content, Wikipedia natu- lly offers a semantically-rich environment for developing Information Retrieval (IR) applications beyond the bag-of-words odel. The first contributions in this area have concentrated on using Wikipedia for the task of entity ranking. Entity rank- g is a retrieval task where searchers are required to find documents representing entities of a certain type (e.g., computer ientists) that are relevant to an input query (e.g., researchers who worked on the halting problem). Evaluation of entity nking systems has been conducted in the context of the INEX evaluation forum since 2006, using Wikipedia as the test llection [48,47]. As this is a task focused on entities and their semantic classes, most approaches have exploited category formation from Wikipedia by either defining a similarity function between the categories associated with the queries d those of the retrieved entities, such as for instance category overlap [153], or by computing statistical associations of rms with category labels [83].

To overcome the fact that Wikipedia contains some entities at are very general (such as countries, for instance), retrieval can be coupled with an idf -like weighting scheme which nalizes over-linked entities [220]. Starting with entity linking, the paper by Kaptein and Kamps [82] in this special issue pands on the authors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 previous work from [83] and shows how category information can also be exploited for other IR skssuchasad-hocretrieval. A semantic IR system which leverages the conceptual space provided by Wikipedia has recently been presented by ozi et al. [52]. Their approach consists of representing both documents and queries using concepts: this semantically-rich presentation is achieved by projecting them into a conceptual vector space using Explicit Semantic Analysis [60].The sults indicate that, while using a semantic representation alone does not improve over a simple bag-of-words approach, s combination with a feature selection procedure is indeed able to achieve state-of-the-art results. In this special issue, e paper by Malo et al. [102] also tackles the problem of semantifying IR systems, however by concentrating, instead, learning semantified queries. In this framework, named Wikipedia-based Evolutionary Semantics (Wiki-ES), wikified eries are learned using a variation of a genetic programming algorithm, and subsequently used to perform concept-based trieval. Although ESA and Wiki-ES provide general retrieval frameworks, both approaches are based upon the semantic ace of Wikipedia concepts. Thus we have yet further examples of the advantages of using a wide-coverage repository of sambiguated concepts. ke-home message 7. The repository of disambiguated concepts found in Wikipedia (i.e., its articles) provides a semantic ace into which documents and queries can be projected in order to perform semantic retrieval beyondthesimplebag-of- ords model. Staying up-to-date: exploiting updated content from revision history One of the most notable characteristics of Wikipedia is that, being an online collaborative medium, its content is contin- usly updated by human editors. Different versions of pages are stored and can be accessed and compared using a content anagement system. For instance, Fig. 4 shows the diff representation for fragments of different revisions of the Alan Tur- g page. Users can arbitrarily modify content by adding and/or removing text, as well as by rephrasing existing text. The quence of different revisions of a Wikipedia article, called its revision history, provides a very large dataset of linguistic ta, which can be used to model how documents evolve through time. This enables a range of NLP applications, and it is these we now turn. writing tasks: sentence compression, text simplification and targeted paraphrasing. The ability to manipulate sentences in scourse includes monolingual text-to-text generation tasks such as sentence compression, text simplification and para- rasing (among many others). Given an input sequence of words, sentence compression aims at finding a subset of is sequence which is both grammatical and meaning-preserving (Fig. 4(a)). Text simplification, on the other hand, canviewed as a rewriting process whose output consists of more accessible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., easier to understand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sentences 18 (F pr [9 re se ed al Th pa ch pa th le pr la us hi in Fi ev pr \u00e2\u20ac\u201c re ba w of BM Hi fo ni fra th de po se to vi re Ta ac di w tio 7. tu pr ed sy 24E.

Finally, paraphrasing consists of finding alternative ways of conveying the same information (Fig. 4(d)). While evious work on these tasks explored a variety of different approaches, including both statistical models using corpus data 0,109,39, inter alia] and hand-crafted rules [34,200], recent proposals have concentrated, instead, on leveraging Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision history as a source of data in order to automatically acquire sentence rewriting models. Initial work in this line of research by Nelken and Yamangil [144,214] proposed creating a dataset of sentence pairs for ntence compression by iterating for each article over each temporally adjacent pair of revisions. For each such pair an it-distance comparison is performed, treating each sentence as an atomic token. The dataset is then built by looking for l replacement operations of one sentence by another, and checking whether one sentence is a compression of the other. e resulting corpus is two orders of magnitude greater than the standard annotated dataset for this task (380,000 sentence irs vs. the 1,067 from Knight and Marcu [90]): this much larger dataset enables a statistical system based on the noisy annel model [90] to achieve a higher compression and grammaticality rate. In a similar vein, Yatskar et al. [215] and Woodsend and Lapata [211] created datasets of simplified word and sentence irs, respectively, by finding reliable alignments between articles in the English and Simple English Wikipedia, 24 and mining e revision history of the latter. Both datasets are then used as training data to effectively learn statistical models of xical and sentence simplification using a probabilistic model of edit operations [215], or by applying an integer linear ogramming model to select the most likely sentence simplification from the output of a quasi-synchronous grammar [211]. Finally, Max and Wisniewski [106] described a method for harvesting a corpus of sub-sentential paraphrases, which was ter used by Bouamor et al. in [24] as a source of data to train a supervised model for validating candidate paraphrases ing information from the Web. In line with findings for sentence compression and text simplification, Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revision story was found to provide a viable source of linguistic data for training monolingual text-to-text generation models, this case at the lower level of phrases. nding relevant terms within documents to improve search. Another application of revision history data is for modeling the olution of documents through time, in order to identify important elements within them. For instance, Aji et al. [9] oposed including information from Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revision history in order to score the relevance of terms within documents i.e., under the assumption that important terms are introduced early in the document history and tend to be kept across visions. Accordingly, their approach, named Revision History Analysis (RHA), scores terms on the basis of a frequency- sed weighting scheme which captures the presence of a term across different document versions: this scoring function as later extended to model so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcburst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, namely drastic content changes deriving from a sudden increase of popularity a document. RHA is extrinsically evaluated as the term weighting component of two state-of-the-art IR models, namely 25 and document language models [95], where it is shown to boost the performance on document search. gh-end semantic applications: Recognizing Textual Entailment. Document revisions also turn out to be a goldmine of data r the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) [44,43]. RTE is a language understanding task which consists of recog- zing whether the meaning of a text fragment (called the hypothesis) can be inferred from the meaning of another text gment (called the premise). Although a wide range of different techniques for performing RTE have been developed over e years [11,17], a problem common to all of them has been the lack of large datasets and this, in turn, has limited the velopment of high-performance statistical models for the task. To overcome this issue, Zanzotto and Pennacchiotti pro- sed harvesting RTE corpora by mining Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revision history [219]. Their approach starts by considering modified ntences in adjacent pairs of revisions as premise-hypothesis entailment pairs. A co-training approach [23] is then used label these candidates as positive and negative instances, and thus iteratively provide additional data for an RTE super- sed learner. The performance boosts on different benchmarking datasets indicate, yet again, the beneficial effects of using vision history data as training data. ke-home message 8. Approaches using Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revision history show that versioned content can be exploited for the quisition of statistical models for different levels of linguistic structure. Applications which benefit from large amounts of achronic information from Wikipedia range, in fact, from sub-sentential paraphrasing and sentence compression all the ay up to tasks beyond the sentence level such as textual entailment, document search and discourse-level text simplifica- n. The tower of Babel: multilingual resources and applications The Web is fundamentally a global and multilingual resource [63]. The existence of such enormous amounts of tex- al information in many languages virtually obliges researchers to develop novel methods for robust multilingual language ocessing. At the same time, vice versa, all this multilingual text represents a veritable goldmine of lexico-semantic knowl- ge in different languages which can be used for a wide range of applications. In this section, we look at how these two nergistic trends go hand in hand in the case of collaboratively-generated semi-structured resources.http://simple.wikipedia.org. di in co m of kn W th 7. sa En of by at N co la (7 (8 ar la fo co on sc na in pe M in of WE. Hovy et al. / Artificial Intelligence 194 (2013) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c27 19 Fig. 5. English and Italian Wikipedia pages for Alan Turing. Multilinguality lies at the very core of collaborative resources such as Wikipedia. In fact, wikipedias in hundreds of fferent languages exist and these are highly interlinked with each other by means of so-called inter-language links. For stance, the English page for Alan Turing (Fig. 5(a)) has an Italian counterpart (Fig. 5(b)): the two pages contain textual ntent and structural features such as infoboxes and categories which are comparable to each other (i.e., they overlap in eaning) despite being in different languages. Parallel multilingual structured resources could potentially benefit a variety multilingual NLP applications: however, the limited availability of such content has, in the past, hindered research on owledge-rich multilingual methods. In the following, we review approaches which overcome this problem by exploiting ikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content and structure across languages in order to perform multilingual knowledge acquisition (Section 7.1), and e application of this knowledge to different multilingual NLP tasks (Section 7.2). 1. Acquiring multilingual knowledge Each of the different types of machine-readable repository of knowledge that we reviewed in Sections 3 and 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., the- uri, semantic relations, taxonomies and ontologies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can be acquired from collaborative resources for languages other than glish. Once again, the key idea is that information encoded within Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shallow structure enables the acquisition large amounts of multilingual lexico-semantic knowledge. In the approaches we will review below this is often achieved leveraging Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multilingual graph (i.e., inter-language links) and page content. So, what we are now going to look is how repositories of knowledge of increasing depth and structure can be built from wikipedias in different languages. on-ontologized resources: parallel corpora and thesauri. An initial approach by Adafre and de Rijke [1] generated parallel rpora from Wikipedia by finding similar sentences in different languages which share links to the same concepts across nguages. For instance, the two sentences: ) Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS (23 June 1912\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 June 1954), was an English mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. ) Alan Mathison Turing (Londra, 23 giugno 1912\u00e2\u20ac\u201cWilmslow, 7 giugno 1954) \u00c3\u00a8 stato un matematico, logico e crittanalista britannico, considerato uno dei padri dell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122informatica e uno dei pi\u00c3\u00b9 grandi matematici del XX secolo. e deemed to be similar, since they contain the links in italics, which point to a description of the same concept in different nguages, e.g., Mathematician and Matematico.Yeetal.[217], on the other hand, developed a graph-based approach r constructing a multilingual thesaurus. Their method represents a thesaurus as a weighted graph whose nodes include ncepts and words in arbitrary languages and edges express relatedness between them (computed using a Dice coefficient link co-occurrence statistics). This method is able to capture from the two sentences above, for example, that computer ientist and crittanalista are related words, since both occur with an instance of the same concept in different languages, mely Mathematician and Matematico. Basically, this approach builds on the method of Ito et al. [79], and extends it to clude words in different languages from Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inter-language links. The output is then extrinsically evaluated by rforming multilingual query expansion on a variety of cross-lingual IR datasets from TREC [202]. ultilingual taxonomies and ontologies. In Section 4.1 we saw that high-quality knowledge acquisition can be attained by tegrating wide-coverage content from Wikipedia with well-structured manual resources such as WordNet. An application this line of research in a multilingual setting was presented by de Melo and Weikum in [113,114].In[113] a UniversalordNet (UWN) is developed by automatically acquiring a semantic network for languages other than English. UWN is 20 Fig co W bo an se co pr fro th of on ba w of ex w he in to hy en a be ge Na in in in fo re la un co tr w Se w an Ta en ac mE.

An illustrative overview of BabelNet centered around the theatrical sense of play: relations between Babel synsets (i.e., multilingually lexicalized ncepts) are obtained from hyperlinks between pages in Wikipedia (e.g., Play (theatre) links to Musical theatre), as well as semantic relations between ordNet synsets (e.g., play 1 n has-part stage direction 1 n ). otstrapped from WordNet and is built by collecting evidence extracted from existing wordnets, translation dictionaries, d parallel corpora. The result is a very large graph combining multilingual lexical information, i.e., multilingual word nses, with WordNet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxonomic backbone. The same authors later presented an extension, named MENTA [114], which nsists of a large-scale taxonomy of named entities and their classes also built from WordNet and Wikipedia. Both ap- oaches focus crucially on building a multilingual taxonomy by (a) collecting large amounts of entities and translations m external resources (such as, e.g., online dictionaries and translations found in Wikipedia); (b) integrating these within e clean taxonomic structure of WordNet (UWN), which is further integrated with concepts from Wikipedia on the basis a resource mapping phase (MENTA). As was the case with taxonomy induction, Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multilinguality also makes it possible to acquire multilingual tologies. Efforts of this kind include monolingual resources in languages other than English, as well as lexical knowledge ses for a multitude of languages. An example of the former is the WOrdnet Libre du Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais [175, WOLF],aFrench ordnet built using Wikipedia, among other resources, to provide a bilingual French\u00e2\u20ac\u201cEnglish semantic lexicon. An evaluation WOLF shows that the straightforward use of inter-language links is able to provide accurate translations for multi-word pressions, a problem typically suffered by ontology learning approaches relying on parallel corpora. As was the case ith monolingual approaches, substantial amounts of lexico-semantic information can be harvested by means of simple uristics, which transform shallow annotations (inter-language links across wikipedias in different languages, in this case) to fully-structured knowledge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., machine-readable disambiguated translations. Nastase et al. [131] presented WikiNet, a very large multilingual semantic network built from Wikipedia. Similar in spirit YAGO and DBPedia, WikiNet makes use of different facets of Wikipedia, including articles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 internal and inter-language perlinks, infoboxes and categories. The concept inventory of WikiNet is constructed using all Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pages (mostly, tities) and categories (typically referring to classes). Relations between concepts, instead, are harvested on the basis of link co-occurrence analysis of Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markup text \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e., a semantically unspecified relation is assumed to exist tween pairs of articles hyperlinked within the same window \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and also collected from relations between categories nerated using the heuristics developed by Ponzetto and Strube [162] and Nastase and Strube [129]. In this special issue, stase and Strube present in [130] an extension of their original work [131], and apply WikiNet to different NLP tasks, cluding computing semantic similarity and metonymy resolution. All multilingual knowledge bases reviewed so far are primarily concerned with conceptual knowledge. At the lexical level, fact, these approaches draw on Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inter-language links (WikiNet), and additionally perform statistical inference, order to produce a more coherent output (MENTA, see also [115]). A complementary contribution which is, instead, cused more on providing wide-coverage lexical knowledge for all languages, is BabelNet [138,139]. Similarly to other sources such as YAGO and UWN/MENTA, BabelNet aims at bringing together \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe best of both worlds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by combining very rge numbers of entities found in Wikipedia with lexicographic knowledge from WordNet, by means of a high-performing supervised mapping framework (cf. Section 4.1). In addition, however, BabelNet also focuses specifically on providing high verage for all languages thanks to Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interlanguage links, and filling the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctranslation gaps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (i.e., missing anslations from Wikipedia) by using statistical machine translation. Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inter-language links are complemented ith translations obtained from a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system applied to sense-labeled data from mCor [119], and Wikipedia itself. The result is a very large lexical multilingual knowledge base, overviewed in Fig. 6, hich has been successfully applied to a variety of monolingual and cross-lingual lexical disambiguation tasks [139,141], d high-performance semantic relatedness [140]. ke-home message 9.

Thanks to a common structure shared ross languages, multilingual approaches can be developed which, in a similar fashion to their monolingual counterparts,ake use of lightweight methods for exploiting semi-structured annotated data. 7. na ti it Sc m cl M cr po of la da th (9 Ri En su Sc cr sa th Ci ve re di th ve m lin of us to ne jo Ta la in co 8. bu Th th w th m of th aE.

Multilingual applications As with the English monolingual scenario (Section 5), the ready availability of large amounts of multilingual knowledge turally offers great potential for the development of multilingual applications. More specifically, the fact that lexicaliza- ons for Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disambiguated concepts are available in many different languages (via its inter-language links) makes possible to develop applications which leverage this multilingual lexical knowledge for a variety of tasks. Richman and hone [171], for instance, presented a method for automatically creating NE-labeled data for a variety of languages. The ethod starts by classifying Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s articles into NE semantic classes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g., Alan Turing is an instance of PERSON.Page assification is achieved on the basis of class-specific keywords (e.g., Alan Turing has categories 20TH-CENTURY MATHE- ATICIANS and PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH BLETCHLEY PARK, which both vote for PERSON). Next, NE-annotated data are eated by projecting the article\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class onto occurrences of internal links to it (that is, all occurrences of internal links inting to Alan Turing are labeled with PERSON,cf.Example2,p.13). Finally, by pivoting across languages on the basis inter-language links, the method is able to assign the same NE class to Wikipedia articles in different languages and thus bel non-English data with NE labels. For instance, given that Alan Turing has been classified using the English Wikipedia ta as an instance of type PERSON, and that that page links to the homonym Italian Wikipedia page, it is possible to label e following internal link in the Italian Wikipedia with that same NE class: ) La Macchina di Turing come modello di calcolo \u00c3\u00a8 stata introdotta nel 1936 da Alan Turing per dare risposta al- l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Entscheidungsproblem (problema di decisione) proposto da Hilbert nel suo programma di fondazione formalista della matematica. chman and Schone used their method for the automatic creation of NE-annotated data for six languages other than glish (French, Ukrainian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese) and then employed these as training data to bootstrap pervised NER systems in these languages. In this special issue, the paper by Nothman et al. [148] builds on Richman and hone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work and their own previous work [147], in order to provide an in-depth analysis of methods for automatically eating multilingual NE corpora from Wikipedia and enabling NER in many different languages. In general, as demonstrated by the multilingual propagation of NE labels, inter-language links essentially relate the me concept across different languages: this, in turn, makes it possible to straightforwardly project models built using e English Wikipedia data to other languages (and vice versa). Departing from this idea as a basis, Potthast et al. [165], miano et al. [38] and Hassan and Mihalcea [69] each developed a cross-lingual version of ESA by mapping the concept ctor representations from one Wikipedia article space to a Wikipedia in another language. As a result they were able to present texts in arbitrary languages as vectors whose elements quantify the strength of association between words (in fferent languages) with (language-independent) concepts: this model is thus able to account, for instance, for the fact that e English computation and the Italian computazione are both strongly related with the named entity Alan Turing.Since ctors are concept-based, language-independent representations, similarity across languages can easily be computed by eans of standard measures, e.g., cosine similarity. This, in turn, enables multilingual semantic applications such as cross- gual search [165,38] and semantic relatedness [69]. An alternative to the distributional approach to semantic relatedness Hassan and Mihalcea [69] was presented by Navigli and Ponzetto [140], who proposed computing semantic relatedness ing the multilingual semantic information found in BabelNet. Their results show that graph-based methods are able outperform distributional ones when provided with high-quality knowledge encoded within a multilingual semantic twork, and that substantial improvements can be achieved by exploiting multilingual information from different languages intly. ke-home message 10. Inter-language linking relates descriptions of the same concept across wikipedias in different nguages. This, in turn, enables the projection of models across languages, since the conceptual level provides a language- dependent representation (i.e., a conceptual interlingua). As a result, information in arbitrary languages can be uniformly mpared at the same semantic level for a variety of cross-lingual applications. Conclusions In this paper we presented a review of work from the recent literature on exploiting semi-structured, collaboratively ilt knowledge resources for AI and NLP, focusing primarily on Wikipedia as the main knowledge repository of this kind. e primary aims of this survey article were twofold: first, we wanted to provide readers with an up-to-date overview of e many different contributions that have been produced in this highly active area of investigation, so as to provide them ith a comprehensive introduction to past and ongoing research directions; second, we were crucially interested in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsetting e stage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the papers contained in this special issue. The feedback we received from the research community for this special issue has been enormously positive, with 71 sub- issions received overall. These 71 papers all underwent an extremely rigorous selection process, carried out by an army more than 150 reviewers who, together with the Artificial Intelligence Journal editors, made it possible for us to guarantee e highest standards. Thanks to this, the 10 papers that we were able to select for inclusion present top-level research onwide spectrum of topics, ranging from computational neuroscience to the acquisition of structured knowledge on a large 22 sc ci so in W w tr no pr se Ac Re [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [E.

Accordingly, we organized the papers contained in this spe- al issue on a thematic basis. The first two papers are devoted to acquiring structured knowledge from semi-structured urces [73,130]. These are followed by papers focused on Information Retrieval [102,82] and Natural Language Process- g [67,148,216,192] applications. Finally, the last two papers present tools for working with semi-structured resources like ikipedia [122], and its use to acquire computational semantic models of mental representations of concepts [154]. Back in 2006, some of us argued that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe can only expect a bright future for automatic knowledge mining techniques ith Wikipedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 [185]. Six years later it is clear that neither work on specific topics nor general interest in this research end have diminished one bit. In this light, it would seem today that we can only expect an even brighter future, in terms t only of new methods, but also of novel tasks and innovative applications. In this sense the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstory so far\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that we have esented here may well turn out to have been just the first step on a long line of path-breaking research exploiting mi-structured knowledge \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthat anyone can edit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. knowledgements The second and third authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the ERC Starting Grant MultiJEDI No. 259234.

Collaboratively built semi-structured content and Artificial Intelligence: The story so far Eduard Hovy a Roberto Navigli b Simone Paolo Ponzetto b \u204e a Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, United States b Dipartimento di Informatica, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy \u204e Corresponding author. Recent years have seen a great deal of work that exploits collaborative, semi-structured content for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This special issue of the Artificial Intelligence Journal presents a variety of state-of-the-art contributions, each of which illustrates the substantial impact that work on leveraging semi-structured content is having on AI and NLP as it continuously fosters new directions of cutting-edge research. We contextualize the papers collected in this special issue by providing a detailed overview of previous work on collaborative, semi-structured resources. The survey is made up of two main logical parts: in the first part, we present the main characteristics of collaborative resources that make them attractive for AI and NLP research; in the second part, we present an overview of how these features have been exploited to tackle a variety of long-standing issues in the two fields, in particular the acquisition of large amounts of machine-readable knowledge, and its application to a wide range of tasks. The overall picture shows that not only are semi-structured resources enabling a renaissance of knowledge-rich AI techniques, but also that significant advances in high-end applications that require deep understanding capabilities can be achieved by synergistically exploiting large amounts of machine-readable structured knowledge in combination with sound statistical AI and NLP techniques.

E-mail address: ish07@aub.edu.lb Abstract Micro modeling of bones is a topic of considerable interest today. These complex organic materials are hierarchical bio-composites characterized by complex multi-scale structural geometry. Specific to bone cutting, the predominant majority of the studies reported in the open literature are based on empirical research and based on macro level description with little, or no, account of the s to re- examine the topic of bone cutting from a micro-structural perspective. For this purpose, a methodology consisting of four major steps was developed: (1) identification of the micro-structural architecture via an automatic methodology for identifying the various microstructures in an optical image taken from (2-year old) bovine femur cortical bone slice, (2) enhancing bone images at the microstructure level and, later, segregating the micro-constituents of the bone as separate artificial intelligence (AI) modules and based on pulsed coupled neural networks (PCNN), (3) assigning mechanical properties for each AI- identified micro-phase in the imagery, and (4) generating an FEM model (DEFORM\u00c2\u00ae) for the simulation of 2D orthogonal bone cutting the results of which can predict the (macro) cutting forces. These simulated cutting forces, based on accounting for the microstructure constituents of the bone, agree with experimental data reported in the literature. This micro-feature-based methodology promises to improve the accuracy of predictions of forces and other relevant parameters while cutting of bones. \u00c2\u00a9 2013 The Authors.

Introduction Bones, rigid organs that support and protect the human body, has complex multi-scale structural geometry and therefore cannot be treated as continuum. The Osteon system is the basic cell construction on which cortical bone is based. Although the Osteon system is predominantly comprised of lamellae matrix, other salient micro-features include Haversian canals, lacunae, cement lines, and other micro features. Several studies have been conducted to study bone cutting and the associated heat generation. A novel cutting process was developed in order to enhance sawing of the bones in surgical procedures by improving cutting rates [1] with the results suggesting that a higher reciprocating frequency may invoke more efficient cutting. A new linear sawing apparatus was created to overcome the drawbacks of unique sawing fixtures, and was evaluated by comparison with previous works [2]. A numerical analysis using finite element on the macro level of the surgical drilling revealed that the forces and stresses decrease with smaller point angles [3]. Finite element macro model of bone cutting suggested a strong dependence of the cutting force on cutting parameters with low depths of cut and cutting tool with sharp edges are favored to reduce cutting forces [4]. Thermo- mechanical finite element model of bone cutting was developed in [5] to optimize cutting parameters to avoid thermal necrosis and improve current orthopedic surgical procedures. Evaluation of the cutting and thrust forces, as well as the cut surface quality, were done over a range of Osteon (micro-structure of the bone) orientations and cutting conditions in an orthogonal machining of cortical bones [6]. Results showed that cutting perpendicular to the Osteons resulted in the highest machining forces and largest surface roughness. The above studies dealt mostly with the bone at the macro level without taking into account the effect of the Available online at www.sciencedirect.com 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In order to have a more realistic model, the geometry must reflect the microstructure of cortical bone via enhancement of bone images at the microstructure level. For modeling bone cutting in finite element models, it would be advantageous to reflect the true complex nature of the bone at the micro scale. A step toward modeling bone geometry is to segregate real bone images into their micro constituents via AI computer vision techniques. In the past, several studies have dealt with bone image processing, for example automated bone image segmentation proved to be efficient in detecting microscopic bone features (e.g. Osteons and Haversian canals) [7]. More recently developed [9] is a technique for effective and consistent extraction of bone features by using hybrid automated gray scale segmentation combined with threshold and edge detection. While providing an automated processing technique of RGB color images, Hage and Hamade [11] processed histological images without the need to convert to gray scale. This technique was demonstrated to be able of distinguishing the salient micro-structural features of a bovine cortical bone, present each of the segregated micro-structural phases on a separate image, and of computing their respective areas and area percentages. Pulse coupled neural networks (PCNN) were proven [12] as robust technique for segmenting medical images e.g. CT and ultrasound images. A multi-channel model m-PCNN was developed to process different kinds of medical images [13]. A new method of image segmentation based on PCNN and entropy was successfully applied on medical image analysis [14]. Brain MRI images were successfully segmented using statistical expectation maximization (EM) model and PCNN [15]. After segmentation and identification of the micro features of the bone, the mechanical properties for each phase would be assigned while noting the hierarchical structure of bone and its mechanical properties [16]. In this paper, we utilize PCNN as an automatic method of segmentation. Image representing similar features are sorted together and appropriate properties are assigned. Later, all images are combined in a master image and imported into a finite element model in the FEM software (DEFORM \u00c2\u00ae , Scientific Forming Technologies Corporation, Columbus, Ohio). Various simulations are run in order to extract forces at the macro scale. These forces will be found to favorably compare with experimentally reported data. 2. Image Segmentation 2.1. Materials and sample preparation All The material used in this study is cortical (mid femur) bone extracted from a bovine animal (cow). Fresh bone sample was immerged in formalin solution during a 3-day period for softening and fixation. Bone pieces were immerged in decalcifying solution (hydrochloric acid <15 %wt., EDTA (ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt) < 5 %wt.) for 20 days. The decalcified bone, a cortex of 2mm thick, was processed in a Leica machine model 300 where they were dehydrated and paraffin protected, after one day they were cut using a rotary microtome (model 340 E microm). Finally, slices were rehydrated using hot water. For better visualization, staining solutions Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for image optical enhancement were used Optical images of slices were acquired using a BX-41M LED optical Olympus microscope. 2.2. PCNN basics PCNN has a biological foundation and is based on the EcKhron model of the cat visual cortex. The neuron in this model contains two input compartments: the feeding and the linking. The feeding receives an external stimulus (S) as well as local stimulus (Y). The linking receives local stimulus. The feeding and the linking are combined in a second-order fashion to create the membrane voltage, U m output is extracted. Figure 1 illustrates the algorithm of the PCNN network [17]. Fig. 1. PCNN scheme, shown is the linking and feeding compartment control unit [17] Mathematical equations which describe the PCNN [17] are based on: Input part: Feeding input: (1) Linking input: (2) Linking part: (.( 1) () ( ) ij ij ij F ij1 F 1 () ( 1) ( .

This value then decays until the neuron fires again [17]. PCNN has several parameters (7 coefficients and weights) that may affect its behaviour. By using the recommended coefficients in [17] and running several iterations, the segmented images representing the micro constituents of the bone were obtained. Weights were so chosen as to be inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the original image pixels. 2.3. Segmented images The PCNN would be launched using a random initial set of parameters. For training purposes, it would be applied to several images of slices with several iterations performed in order to reach the targeted segmented images. Typical resulting PCNN output images are shown in figure 2. The identified micro-constituents of the bones appear to be of good quality and demonstrate the robustness of this method for segmenting and classifying features in microscopic images of bone slices.

Finite Element Model 3.1. Model configuration For the work piece (bone), the output images extracted per the above methodology were imported into AUTOCAD\u00c2\u00ae where a micro-model was generated combining each micro-constituent of the bone. This resulting features geometry would be imported into DEFORM\u00c2\u00ae. Figure 3 shows a typical imported micro geometric model with dimensions of 156 m x 206 m x 15 m (thick). Using the scale bar, these dimensions would be scaled up into micrometer 540 \u00ce\u00bcm \u00c3\u2014 710 \u00ce\u00bcm (a 270 \u00ce\u00bcm \u00c3\u2014 355 \u00ce\u00bcm rectangular fragment of the bone was used to represent a symmetrical half model of that was used in the simulations).

Model of the bone work piece showing (in blue) the osteoblast lamellae boundaries and (in gold) the lamellae matrix Tool: The modelled tool represents one toothed saw (one of many) present in surgical tools. The rake angle was chosen to be 20 \u00c2\u00b0 as in [21]. The cutting tool (shown in figure 4) was modelled as rigid solid where the stiffness was much greater than that of the bone. Fig.4. Cutting tool: shown as 3D view (left) and top 2D view (right) 3.2. Meshing and simulation control Tetrahedral elements were used to mesh the tool and the work piece (bone), and finer mesh was applied to the tip of the tool and the regions were the bone is cut. For the work piece, 192709 elements were used with a minimum element size of 0.00014 mm. For the tool 8946 elements were used with minimum element size of 0.005 mm. The resulting mesh is shown in figure 5. Active re-meshing was considered with a relative interference ratio of 0.7 and a maximum stroke increment of 1 \u00ce\u00bcm to ensure proper interaction between the tool and work. The simulation time step was estimated based on the size of the smallest element in the work piece. Fig. 5. Meshed tool and bone (shown with assigned materials) 3.3. Mechanical properties Cortical bone, with its Osteons aligned predominantly along its longitudinal axis, was modeled as fiber-reinforced composite heterogeneous material. Mechanical properties of the bone and its micro constituent were imported from other workers. The thermal properties for the Osteon (Osteoblast lamellae matrix) and lamellae matrix regions were assumed to have the same value. Table 1.

The model accounts for strain-rate and temperature effects. The material was considered as an elastic-plastic with bilinear strain hardening.

Hage and Ramsey F. Hamade / Procedia CIRP 8 ( 2013 ) 385 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 390 due to lack of reliable data). The material for the tool used was diamond (young's modulus 900 ) used in surgeries for bone cutting with mechanical properties set as per the library in Deform\u00c2\u00ae. 3.4. Boundary conditions The outer surfaces of the work were defined as fixed boundary. A heat transfer condition for all surfaces with the environment was set. The tool was given a speed in y-direction. In addition, an extra boundary condition in the z- direction prevented the chip from traveling in the z- direction since the width of cut in this model is very thin. 3.5. Work-tool interaction As in [21], the shear friction factor and convection heat transfer coefficient at the contact interface between the tool and the work were set to 0.35 and 8000 , respectively. 4. Results The cutting simulations were run on an Intel core i73612QM CPU @ 2.1 GHz with 6 GB RAM (64-bit operating system) and took around 15 hours on average. Fig.6. Chip formation along with the stress contours Typical results of the generated chip and contour values of effective stress (MPa) are shown in figure 6. Cutting simulations were done for 3 values of depth-of- cut (DOCs). The resultant force (square root of the sum of the feed force (Ff) component and tangential (Ft) cutting force component) were found in this work to agree favorably (under the same cutting conditions) with experimental results reported in [21] as summarized in table 2.

In figure 7, the resultant force-time graphs were overlaid on those reported in [21]. Although at the end the values are comparable, the start of the simulations of the predicted force development is less steep than those in [21]. One likely cause of deviation at start may have to do with the nose radius being sharp in this work compared with a 10 m nose radius in [21] (recommended for orthopaedic bone surgery). Overall, this methodology appears to be capable of identifying the macro forces by way of modelling the micro constituents of the bone. Fig.7. Comparison of the simulated forces in this work vs. experimental results in [21] 5. Summary To study the effect of the micro-structure on the generated forces while cutting bone, an AI-based methodology was developed in this work. First, the heterogeneous micro-constituents of the bone in optical image of actual bone slices were recognized using AI- identified (PCNN).

Micro modeling of bones is a topic of considerable interest today. These complex organic materials are hierarchical bio-composites characterized by complex multi-scale structural geometry. Specific to bone cutting, the predominant majority of the studies reported in the open literature are based on empirical research and based on macro level description with little, or no, account of the contributions attributed to the micro structural architecture (Osteons, Haversian canals, lamellae\u2026). The aim of this study i s to re- examine the topic of bone cutting from a micro-structural perspective. For this purpose, a methodology consisting of four major steps was developed: (1) identification of the micro-structural architecture via an automatic methodology for identifying the various microstructures in an optical image taken from (2-year old) bovine femur cortical bone slice, (2) enhancing bone images at the microstructure level and, later, segregating the micro-constituents of the bone as separate images using MATLAB's artificial intelligence (AI) modules and based on pulsed coupled neural networks (PCNN), (3) assigning mechanical properties for each AI- identified micro-phase in the imagery, and (4) generating an FEM model (DEFORM\u00ae) for the simulation of 2D orthogonal bone cutting the results of which can predict the (macro) cutting forces. These simulated cutting forces, based on accounting for the microstructure constituents of the bone, agree with experimental data reported in the literature. This micro-feature-based methodology promises to improve the accuracy of predictions of forces and other relevant parameters while cutting of bones.

Introduction There is something extremely incredible and stunningly intuitive in the ideology behind artificial intelligence in computer science and functionalism in philosophy of mind. It is my initial aim, in this paper, to reveal and examine this ideology from a philosophical perspective. To this purpose, I first give a very short sketch of functionalism. Then, I move on to explain the Platonic ideology, which, in my view, is deeply rooted in almost all versions of functionalism. This ideology is often argue for the claim that the software/hardware dichotomy is only a pragmatic distinction, and it should not be taken to imply metaphysically exclusive categories. Having shown the misconception about this distinction, then, I will suggest, in the last section, that there could be a better, more sensible, metaphysics at the background of functionalism, one that may offer a much more fruitful way to understand the nature of representation and mind. * Corresponding author: okel.

Artificial psychology and functionalism Artificial Intelligence (shortly as AI) is a research field that aims to investigate the question of whether it is logically and technically possible to build machines or program computers that can achieve diverse sorts of cognitive activities, activities that involve deductive and inductive reasoning, believing, desiring, planning, dreaming, etc., much like the activities of which normal adult human beings are capable. For Simon and Newell, building computers that can think was not only logically possible, they believed that soon we will be witnessing that a digital compute mathematical theorem, it will compose a fine piece of music, and most importantly with these advances in AI, most theories in psychology will take the form of computer programs, or of qualitative statements about the characteristics of computer programs (Simon & Newell, 1958). This could have been the most robust expression of the initial targets and ideology behind AI. Simon and Newell put forward a firm and strong claim that there is no contradiction in terms about the idea of artificial psychology. After one point, there will be probably no sense to distinguish artificially intelligent systems from naturally intelligent organisms. We will eventually have the same moral obligations toward them, at least so Simon and Newell might believe. On the other hand, a few philosophers in the late- , who were deeply fascinated by the computer model of mind and Turing machines, began to develop a functionalist theory of mind (henceforward as FTM) that updates behaviorism and mind-brain identity theory (Block, 1980; Block, 1995; Kim, 1996). Since then FTM has been the cornerstone of the contemporary philosophy of mind. Functionalism achieves two things. First, as opposed to the behaviorist framework, it prominently demonstrates the fact that mental states must be inner states with functional-causal roles. Secondly, as opposed to chauvinistic attitude in the mind-brain identity theory, it opens up a widely liberal perspective through which any kind of being/system (e.g. computers, souls, extra-terrestrials) that can pass Turing Test is qualified as an intelligent being. In a way, FTM has brought forth a radical change to our way of describing mentality and intelligence by offering a new conceptual repertoire for the comprehension of the metaphysics of mind, a framework that was not only backed up by largely optimistic AI research predictions but also pumped up with extremely powerful forces of intuition and imagination. In order to pinpoint the underlying ideology behind FTM, it is crucial to provide a brief sketch of the theory in a few lines beforehand. With this brief presentation, I hope, one will be able to come to recognize its thought- provoking and intuition-based reasoning features. Without further ado, let us then give an outline of Functionalism. Consider the following simple example of keys. A key can be realized by many diverse physical kinds. For instance, it can be made out of metal, plastic, wood, and so forth. It may also come in many different shapes, weighs, colors, etc. But, all these keys have one thing in common, that is to say that their job is to unlock By the same token, functionalists argue for the claim that the intrinsic/essential property of a mental state has to do with its causal role in a network of functional architecture of a being/system, and it has nothing to do with what realizes or occupies that role. Hence, there is the distinction between role and occupant of mental states. A mental state can be realized by physically, and even spiritually, different beings, and provided that a state has the same functional role across different physical/spiritual beings, then we are entitled to assign the same mental state to all these beings. It is even possible for the same individual to entertain the same mental state when the state in question is realized by different physical-chemical states of the individual at different times. More explicitly, FTM states the following claim: Any being/system B is in a type M of mental state, if there is a state of B that plays a particular functional/causal role F (definitive of that M-type) within a complex network of states of B such that it mediates, together with other relevant states in that network of states, between perceptual inputs and behavioral outputs of B. It is a purely empty and futile enterprise, according to the functionalist metaphysics of mind, to explore the source of psychological laws, which govern mental operations and behaviors of material or spiritual beings, in 14 Nazim Gokel / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 82 ( 2013 ) 12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 18 the underlying (material/spiritual) structure/substance where those laws make their first appearance. This is another way of saying that there is no difficulty, in principle, for the individuation of the same mental states in physically/spiritually differently composed beings and substances, provided that those beings and substances manifest functionally equivalent architectures, i.e. a functional organization of an appropriate kind that is constitutive of mentality and intelligence. Viewed in this manner, functionalism surprisingly makes both materialists and spiritualists happy, probably the first time in the history of mankind. For instance, let us have a look at the functionalist description of pain for material beings: A material subject, M, is in pain, if there is a functional state, say F10, such that it mediates, together with the other functional states, between bodily damage and avoidance/escape behavior from the source of that bodily damage. And now have a look at spiritual pain: A spiritual subject, S, is in pain, if there is a functional state, say F10, such that it mediates, together with the other functional states, between spiritual damage (as the effect of psychological disturbance of another soul) and avoidance/escape behavior from the source of that spiritual damage. [Both examples belong to me] Any mental state, intentional or phenomenal, can be realized in material or spiritual substances, and it just does not matter at all in which kind of substance it is embodied or ensouled. The material or spiritual host of mental states does not contribute to the essence of those states; they are required only for the realization of those states. In a sense, they help them come into being, but they do not determine the essence of mental states. But, this gives rise to a number of questions: Can functionalists successfully explain the essence of mental states merely in terms of amount to exactly? To begin with, mental states are not only inner states with functional-causal roles; they also have intentional and qualitative properties. For simplicity, let us take a belief as the paradigm example of mental states. A belief, from a functionalist point of view, is a monadic functional state, say F10, with a unique causal role such that, whenever such-and-such input conditions obtain, it typically leads to another functional state(s), say F11, which together typically terminate in such-and-such output patterns. At this point, it is not very clear, however, whether functionalism can reduce or explain intentional and phenomenal characteristics of mental states purely in terms of functional-causal roles. According to Brentano, one of the touchstones of mentality is that mental states represent things in the world as being a certain way, that is to say they are all about something in particular. Moreover, intentional systems are capable of entertaining thoughts that involve things not present/available at the moment of thinking or, even, things that are non-existent objects in the world. These two features are commonly called intentional in- qualitative experience, what it is like to be in that state. Qualia may be, for some people, one of the most important ingredients of mentality without which we may never be said to be conscious of anything. -Earth thought experiment (Putnam, 1975) Room argument (Searle, 1980) -experiment (Block, 1978), a great number of people began to suspect (1) whether it is really true that if A and B are functionally equivalent, then A and B cannot differ with respect to contents/meanings of their functional states (Shagrir, 2005), (2) whether functional duplicates can instantiate authentic intentionality, (3) whether functional duplicates are capable of thoughts and consciousness. Let this suffice for a short review of functionalism. In the sequel, I will attempt to highlight the underlying ideology behind FTM. 3. The Platonic ideology I tend to believe that there exists a hidden Platonic ideology behind functionalism, operative in the background of almost each version of it. This ideology, a two-leveled explanatory framework, is often manifested with its constant emphasis on the software/hardware dichotomy. are in order. 15 Nazim Gokel / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 82 ( 2013 ) 12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 18 -changing paradigms or archetypes that exist in the realm of Being; whereas objects/things in the realm of Becoming are imperfect and subject to change over time. Platonic Forms are, in a sense, ideal, (ultimately) real and perfect models in which particular things in the realm of Becoming share or participate. In other words, those ordinary objects are only exemplifications or realizations of Forms. Logically speaking, the very existence of ordinary objects (logically and ontologically) depends on the existence of Forms, because without any Form that exists to be shared, there could not be ordinary objects too (Watson, 1995). Thus, the Form X exists independently of X-ing objects, but X- ing objects cannot exist without the Form X. Metaphorically speaking, objects in the material world are like shadows of those ultimately real Forms in the world of Being. Within this context, a soul, according to Plato, is a miserable and unhappy prisoner in a body with forgotten memories, and its freedom and capacity to know the real nature of things lies in its own intellectual revolution by means of which it comes to a gradual recognition of the fact that ultimate reality lies beyond the shadows of the material world. It is striking to notice that FTM is deeply rooted in a Platonic metaphysics. In much the same spirit, FTM asserts the claim that the function of something (e.g. keys, coke-machines, computers) is independent of the physical aspects of what realizes it. Then, it follows, according to functionalists, that a mental state must be identified with a functional state that is independent of the physical/spiritual make-up of whatever embodies or ensouls it. In functionalism, there is a two-leveled conceptual scheme according to which any given mental state is described with reference to its physical/spiritual composition or its (potential or actual) causal role in a vast array of functional architecture. From a functionalist point of view, lower-level aspects of mental states (e.g. neural firings, synapses in the neural networks) only indicate what mental states are actually made of with respect to one kind of intelligent beings (e.g. human beings and some animals), but they do not explain what constitutes/makes up mental states in general. A pain, for instance, can be realized by C-fiber activations in human beings, or it can be realized by D-fiber activations in octopuses, or, even, it can be realized by some kind of plasma in extra-terrestrial creatures. There must be a universal pain in virtue of which (physically/spiritually) different kinds of pain-suffering beings/systems are said to be in pain. To explain this conceivability of a universal psychology, FTM provides a very liberal account of mind according to which mental states are, in essence, functional states. Functional states, in turn, stand for higher-level properties of intelligent beings, intrinsic properties that give something a definitive character, e.g. being a kind of intelligent being/system. For FTM, it is not the fine structural details about the material/spiritual host, but the functional details about the complex causal network that determine whether a being/system has a share in universal mentality and intelligence. Functionalism, therefore, rests on the assumption that there is a universal psychology that can be shared across physically/spiritually diverse beings/systems. This ideology is often illustrated with the software/hardware dichotomy. Heil (1998) says that: program can run on very different sorts of material device. In the same vein, we might suppose that every mind has some material embodiment, although minds may have very different kinds of material embodiment. In the case of human beings, our brains constitute the hardware on which our mental software runs. Alpha Centaurians, in contrast, might share our psychology, our mental software, yet have very different, perhaps non-carbon-based, hardware. (p. 91) This is one of the fine instances of the computer model of mind according to which mind is nothing but a universal software that can run on radically different sorts of physical/spiritual stuff. Intelligent beings are intelligent, because all of them share the same universal psychology/software regardless of the differing (material or spiritual) ways they realize that psychology/software. This way of characterizing mind, however, gives rise to a number of questions. As far as I can see, there could be two groups of questions, the former of which is related to the identity conditions of a software and the latter of which is related to the emergent need to clarify notions of s begin with the first group of questions. 16 Nazim Gokel / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 82 ( 2013 ) 12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 18 Can there really be a universal software/program that can run on different kinds of hardware? The very idea of universal software implies the claim that it is possible to run exactly the same program in physically diverse machines/hardware. But, the following question must be answered first: Under which conditions it is true to say that X is exactly the same program running on different machines? From my point of view, the idea of universal software must be, at least, a matter of debate, yet most people find it obvious and straightforward. Consider the following case. Suppose that you have a program running so smoothly on one of the most advanced computer hardware technologies available now, a computer that is composed of high-tech silicon chips and electronic circuits. Just think what would happen if you want to use exactly the same program in old computers composed of valves and gears. Can it be installed in the first place? One can plausibly argue for the claim that the way to program old computers must be extremely different from the way to program recent computers, because their computational architecture is radically different due to the physical structure of their components. Installing the same program, however, might not be the real problem after all; one can find a good medium to do the work of installation. But, one can go on to insist that installing the same program will require much labor to modify the algorithm in order to adapt computational and physical capacities of the old hardware. So, if the algorithm is the heart of any software, then changing the structure of an algorithm is nothing but playing with the identity conditions of software. If this is true, then we can no longer talk about the identity of software over physically diverse machines (see Eliasmith, 2002). As for the second set of questions, it is not really clear whether software is something entirely independent of hardware. In general, functionalists seem to hold a view that software-properties of X mark a completely different and independent category than those hardware-properties of X. Does this distinction between software- properties of X and hardware-properties of X really entail that software is entirely independent of hardware? Or, broadly speaking, does the distinction between pure functional properties and pure structural/physical properties n of Computer programs are often considered to be part of the software of a computer as opposed to the hardware. Unfortunately, computer hardware is frequently characterised as 'the physical units making up a computer system' (Chandor [1970], p. 179). By contrast this seems to suggest that software is not part of the computer system or even worse that it is not physical. It is important to remember that computer programs can be understood on the physical level as well as the symbolic level. The programming of early digital computers was commonly done by plugging in wires and throwing switches. Some analogue computers are still programmed in this way. The resulting programs are clearly as physical and as much a part of the computer system as any other part. Today digital machines usually store a program internally to speed up the execution of the program. A program in such a form is certainly physical and part of the computer system. Furthermore, since programming can occur on many levels, it is useful to understand the software/hardware dichotomy as a pragmatic distinction. (p. 215) The whole point boils down to the issue whether software-properties and hardware-properties of a computer indicate a metaphysical distinction or a pragmatic distinction. Moor has a way to settle this issue. For him, one can describe any given computer in terms of its physical aspects or symbolic aspects. For instance, a computer, in a physical description, is an entity composed of silicon chips, electronic circuits and so forth. If you hold on to this description and know enough about the laws of physics about electronics, Moore suggests, you will be able to predict any computer behavior. In addition, one can describe any given computer with respect to its symbolic features. Consider a chess-playing computer. In this case, a computer is a system that can take certain kinds of inputs as symbols, go to a set of states relevant to that input, make use of its database and algorithms, and choose the best output in accordance with inputs. If you detect, for instance, that the computer always moves its queen too early, and know enough about the logical structure of the computer, then you may easily spot the source of the problem ( Dennett, 1978, p. 107; see also Cummins, 1986; Skokowski, 1994). 17 Nazim Gokel / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 82 ( 2013 ) 12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 18 By following this strategy, for Moor, one can also provide two different ways to characterize a computer ymbolic 1978, p. 213). In the final analysis, Moor wanted to show that software and hardware terms do not actually signify mutually exclusive categories. Just because one can explain software properties of a computer without a reference to its physical aspects, this does not, in any sensible way, prove that software properties are independent from hardware properties. The software/hardware distinction is a pragmatic distinction, and programming, as Moor and Lycan made painstaking efforts to sho perspective (Lycan, 1990; Moor, 1978). 4. Mental representation: Instead of explaining Form as something connected with Matter, Platonic metaphysics takes it to have a higher-order mode of being, one that is independent of ordinary material objects and the logical/ontological ground of them. Similarly, FTM takes functional properties of mental states as higher-order properties that are independent of physical/spiritual properties of their realizers/hosts and the existence of those functional properties in any body/soul actually explains the reason of that body/soul being intelligent and conscious. In particular, FTM accepts a very Platonic idea that there is universal software that can run on and be shared across physically/spiritually diverse kinds of beings/systems. At the end of the previous section, I provided a number of reasons why this way of characterizing mentality and intelligence is very problematic. Alternatively, one can adopt an Aristotelian metaphysics according to which the Form of something is intimately connected with the Matter of that being/system. In the context of our discussion of functionalism, one can plausibly argue for the claim that functional properties of mental states are not independent of the physical/spiritual properties of their realizers/hosts; they actually emerge directly out of the physical/spiritual properties of their hosts. So, there is an intimate connection between the role X and the (physical/spiritual) occupant of that role X (Armstrong, 1968; Lewis, 1966). This way of reading functionalism, I believe, may prove to be much more fruitful and rewarding. Let us turn back to the problem of intentionality for functionalism and attempt to develop a possible answer by adopting an Aristotelian framework at the background this time. One of the effective ways to describe intentionality is that intentional systems differ from non-intentional systems in that states of the former have the capacity to represent things in the world as being in a certain way, whereas states of the latter do not have any capacity to represent anything at all. At this point, the central issue of intentionality appears to be based on the concept of representation. From a broad perspective, the question of artificial and natural intelligence is really a question about the nature of representation; i.e. what is it for something to (mentally) represent something else? So, if we have a good theory of representation, we will be able to answer the question of (1) the emergence of intentionality and (2) whether it is possible for artificial systems to be capable of intentional states. Elsewhere (in my ongoing Ph.D. thesis) I developed a theory of representation and I attempted, in particular, to answer the question of what it is to have a mental representation. From my point of view, mental representation is a special kind of structure (i.e. a map-like structure) that originates from the physical/structural resources of representing vehicles and it emerges as a result o representational mechanism. If mental representations are the product of representing vehicles and if the contents of mental representations are limited and sensitive to what physical/structural properties of representing vehicles are capable of representing plus the pressing environmental conditions determining the evolution of the function of those representing vehicles, then, it follows, two systems/beings which are unlike with respect to representational vehicles and evolutionary history cannot entertain the same representational content. For instance, a human being and a robot will never have the same mental representation of a dog, or the event of a 18 Nazim Gokel / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 82 ( 2013 ) 12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 18 snake crawling on the sand. For, they will have different modes of presentations under which any object or event is conceived. In conclusion, I do not claim that it is logically or technically impossible to create or build artifacts that have intelligence and psychology on their own. I do not believe, however, that there is a universal psychology that is up and running across radically different kinds of beings/systems. I attempted to show, in a number of points, where the idea of a universal psychology is very problematic. In the final analysis, it does seem to me that a human being and a robot may look at the same dog and can produce the same behavioral response, but it is highly unlikely that they will have the same representation of that dog. They do not have the same representing vehicles, nor do they have the same evolutionary history underlying the teleological function of those vehicles. Thus, neither representational content nor a universal psychology will be shared. Acknowledgements I owe special thanks to Prof. Stephen Voss for his invaluable criticisms and suggestions.

In this paper, I aim to reveal and examine the ideology behind artificial intelligence and functionalism from a philosophical perspective. To this aim, I first give a short review of functionalism. Then, I move on to explain the Platonic ideology, which, according to me, is deeply rooted in almost all versions of functionalism. I argue for the claim that the software/hardware dichotomy is only a pragmatic distinction and one should not expect to find mutually exclusive categories signified by software and hardware terms. In the final section, I suggest that there could be a better, more sensible, metaphysics at the background of functionalism, one that may offer a much more fruitful way to understand the nature of representation and mind.

They should not be conscious of how these features are implemented, from a hardware or from a software point of view. In order to obtain such a high degree of transparency, it is necessary for the system to be able to provide its services regardless of location, adapting to the environment and the context in general and to the available hardware more specifically. This is known as ubiquity, and to achieve it requires considering many aspects, from security and privacy to system interoperability. This paper is mainly focused on the development of two elements related to ubiquity: physical migration of components between different platforms together with their associated runtime state, and the adaptation of those components to the destination platform and physical environment. These solutions are being addressedwithin our efforts for the development of a general- purpose middleware for Ambient Intelligence in the framework of the HI3 project. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This goal is achieved in AmI systems by offering their functionality to users in the most transparent way possible, and transparent operation has multiple implications. For example, the interaction with the user should use natural interfaces as much as possible, the system should show autonomous and proactive behavior, it should require little intervention in system management and its functionality must be ubiquitous to the users. Ubiquity, namely the capability of the system to provide its services regardless of location and the devices available, is an important topic in AmI, as it is a key enabler to release the user from the management of its applications and data. But ubiquity is not an easy goal and a lot of issues must be addressed. Interoperability between the different systems involved, fault-tolerant distributed operation, physical mobility of system components, self-organization of components, heterogeneity of devices and services available in each environment, user location tracking, and a lot of security and privacy issues, are among the most important ones. In the framework of HI3 [1], an integral Ambient Intelligence platform that has been in development in our lab for the last few years, this paper is focused mainly on the mobility of components and some of its associated issues, like reorganization of components and renegotiation and adaptation of behaviors after a component migration process. \u00e2\u02c6\u2014 Corresponding author.

Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 Component mobility has been addressed using tools and techniques from many different fields. The distributed computingworld has provided general solutions for service-oriented systems andmulti-agent systems, but special emphasis must be placed on more specific solutions coming from the area of ubiquitous computing. Multi-agent technologies are a prominent source of solutions for software mobility because of the benefits obtained by agents with the ability to migrate from one host to another [2]. The most popular multi-agent platforms have some level of integrated support for agent mobility [3,4]. Commonly, the solutions applied by these technologies are simple, leaving in the hands of the developers a lot of responsibility, but they are also very general, so they can be used for multiple purposes. They provide only code and state migration support, and the main problem addressed is the interoperability between heterogeneous platforms, especially when dealing with platforms that have communications compatibility but are implemented with different base technologies (programming language, computer platforms, etc.). This problem has been recently addressed in [5] by specifying a common interface to manage the lifecycle of agents in a FIPA [6] platform, as well as by providing common agent models and data encoding mechanisms to enable interoperability between platforms that do not support the same programming languages. Even though they are not directly related to ubiquitous computing, Fluid Computing [7,8] techniques are interesting proposals for user application mobility. They rely mostly on application state replication and synchronization, especially bearing in mind disconnection issues. In the case of [8] they also provide support for application code replication. Another important source for mobility solutions is the service-oriented field. The SOA approach has been widely used by ubiquitous computing solutions, and as such, many have recognized the necessity to provide support for service mobility. Two approaches that need to be mentioned are [9] and TaskShadow [10]. The former has extended the OSGi platform to support service replication and state synchronization between replicas. It has also increased the service description capabilities of OSGi with environment contextual information, so that the migration process can be driven by context changes. TaskShadow applies a very different approach to mobility because it does not rely on code migration. Instead, it introduces the concept of task as an abstract description of user intents and a set of functionalities required to perform some user task. It achieves user mobility migrating a user task by searching local services that fulfill the requirements of the task. The Aura [11] project is in some ways a precedent of TaskShadow. It also contemplates the idea of user task and relies on local components to fulfill the requirements of a task. Aura was designed for a classical desktop environment and thus it does not use context information to adapt the user task to a new environment. Finally, another very clear example ofmobility solutions is the Gaia OS project [12]. It provides a development framework that divides applications using theMVC pattern. The different components of the application can bemigrated and replicated to different hosts. These projects are mainly focused on the distribution and migration of applications that make use of distributed devices (sensors, actuators and others) available in each environment. Therefore, even though they address important areas of application mobility, like the physical migration of the application, the discovery of compatible devices and some sort of component reorganization, they do not take into account specific topics of AmI applications, like user preference management, adaptation of behavior to the users and the environment, or context management. We have been working on the development of a complete component mobility solution for AmI applications and its integration in the HI3 architecture. The final objective is to propose an integral solution to the mobility issues that affect AmI systems, providing approaches for topics like physical component migration, negotiation and discovery of hardware requirements, component self-organization, component self-adaptation to user and environment preferences, user data privacy and component behavior security, as well as application interaction adaptation. This is a long-term development effort and this paper deals with some of the first developments in this area of HI3. Specifically, the mobility solution presented here adds to the HI3 framework the capability of migrating selected services and applications, including their current state, from one platform to another that is located anywhere. Migration is driven by a user mobile device, such as a smartphone, where the user transparently carries information about his/her applications and services. This information includes descriptions, requirements, preferences and needs. As the user goes from one environment to another, the mobile device searches for platforms capable of running the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s components and negotiates the migration of these components with the target platform. Additionally, in order to facilitate the adaptation of migrated components to the new platform, this solution includes a semantic service descriptionmodel and amatchmaking algorithm. They allow the definition of components in terms of their requirements in such a way that these requirements can be satisfied later at run-time by selecting the best services of the target platform to serve to the migrated components. The introduction of a user owned mobile device, which manages the migration process, is one of the main differences between the solution presented here and the current state of the art. It introduces a profound conceptual change in the way the migration process is initiated. While previous solutions rely on the local system to monitor the user and decide when and where to migrate components, here it is the user device which is the one that monitors the environment, seeking local systems that could be adequate for migrating user services in order to increase performance, functionality, etc. As will be seen, this allows the system to take advantage of user information to guide the migration process, without exposing it to external or untrusted sources. It must also be mentioned that, in order to evaluate the solution proposed here in terms of others that are representative of the state of the art, an extensive qualitative comparison has been included in Section 5. Due to the lack of a clear, standardized and generally accepted comparisonmethodology within the field, a series of characteristics or features sought in these systems have been chosen as comparison axes and the different solutions have been evaluated in terms of these A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 1973 features. The results of this process clearly delimit the strong points and weaknesses of our approach in the context of those that are currently more relevant. The rest of the paper has been structured as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a detailed exploration of the mobility issues and benefits in an Ambient Intelligence environment. A brief description of the HI3 platform is provided in Section 3, along with an explanation of the solutions developed, referencing the previously described use case example. Next, Section 4 presents an example use case of themobility capabilities of theHI3 platform. A comparison of solutions for softwaremobility, focusing on those projects related to smart environments or ubiquitous computing, and including the HI3 approach, is commented on in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 presents some conclusions and future work. 2. Challenges and objectives As briefly stated in Section 1, ubiquitous access to AmI systems is an important requirement to achieve the transparent operation goals of Ambient Intelligence. Ubiquity implies a lot of benefits for the users, but it requires some complex requirements to be fulfilled [13]. This section presents the main benefits of ubiquity, and its associated requirements and challenges. Sometimes, the benefits of migrating components instead of remotely accessing services and devices to achieve ubiquity may not be obvious, because inmany cases similar functionality can be achievedwhilemaintaining the different elements of the system distributed in their original hosts. But migration support can improve AmI systems in aspects such as autonomy or network dependency. In a realistic scenario, the user cannot expect that any platform provide services with the functionality he needs. Furthermore, even if the services of the target platform provide the requested functionality, it is possible that they cannot remotely access the user data. In these cases, it seems a better solution tomigrate some user components from one platform to another, instead of only trying to make use of the available local services as other approximations do. Moreover, if all the components are executed locally within the data sources and end devices, the network bandwidth requirements are effectively reduced and the network latency is eliminated. This last point is especially important for interactive real-time systems like AmI applications, which must control devices to interact with a human populated environment. Thanks to migration, AmI systems can even continue operating in environments that do not have a network connection, or when the network fails. Regarding privacy and security, by migrating components, instead of letting some external software access and manage user data, the user components, with their user defined security and access control measures, directly manage the devices and data. As opposed to this, if the service was operating remotely, either local sensing data would be sent to a remote platform, or personal information about the user would be sent to the local services, both of which could imply a privacy problem. However, the migration of software components and data to different platforms may also involve severe security and privacy problems. One of the main concerns is ensuring that malicious components are not able to affect the normal operation of the target platform. With this in mind, the main goal of this work is to build the basis of a mobility framework that takes full advantage of migrating software components between different platforms without limiting the use of other approaches when appropriate. Thus, the proposed solution can be considered a hybrid approach, consisting of using existing local services when it is possible and migrating user components if existing local services cannot fulfill the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirements. Furthermore, this solution follows a user-guided approach. That is achieved through the use of a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s component running on a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal device that has information about the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferences and drives the migration process. This approach to performing migrations, as opposed to the traditional method where the platforms monitor the users and actively make all the decisions about migration, increases user privacy. Unknown (to the user) remote platforms do not access user information in order to decide whether a migration is needed, rather, it is software running in the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s device which is the one that takes the initiative and accesses the information from the different platforms and makes the decision about migration. This way, it is possible to incorporate information about platform trust to the decision process. However, as we introduced before, this approach comes with a lot of challenges that AmI systems developers must address: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Code transfer and state synchronization. The code of the components of a system needs to be transferred from one host to another, and the receiving host must be able to execute it [14,8]. Also the component state must be transferred and recomposed at the destination. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Resource allocation. The destination host must have the resources (computing, sensing, interaction, etc.) required by the component to operate [15,9]. Furthermore, the migrated components can run into conflicts with previously existing components on the use of a resource. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Security and privacy. The system must safeguard the host environment from potentially malicious incoming components, for example, using a sandbox that restricts the actions they can perform. And, vice versa, protect incoming components from malicious hosts, so that components perform the actions they are supposed to [13]. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 User interaction. The user interface components benefit most frommobility, as they need to use local devices and show low latency operation. The main challenges faced in this case are the heterogeneity of the interaction devices available in each environment, as well as the differences in interaction abilities of each user [16,17]. Ubiquitous UIs must support 1974 A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 HI 3 PLATFORM APPLICATIONS SERVICES SENSING/ACTUATION SERVICES UNIFORM DEVICE ACCESS(UniDA) HETEROGENEOUS COMMUNICATION CHANNELS S/A C O N T E X T C O M P O N E N T R E P O S I T O R Y DEVICE Fig. 1. HI3 software architecture. multiple modes of interaction, as well as autonomous adaptation to the devices and interaction modes available for each environment and user. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Component relations managing. Components are not used in an isolated manner [10]. In general the users are carrying out many tasks at the same time, and the system can even be autonomously carrying tasks out for the users. The system must be able to manage the relations between the components and the tasks in order to optimize the migration process. As can be seen, Ambient Intelligence platforms and middleware have in mobility an important source of challenges and opportunities to address in order to provide developerswith powerful tools that facilitate the development of real ubiquitous applications. 3. Component migration and adaptation in HI3 This section is devoted to the description of the particular mobility solutions developed and their integration within the HI3 architecture for AmI systems. First of all, a brief description of the HI3 architecture is presented. This architecture provides support for the development and integration of applications and services in AmI environments. Additionally, this architecture provides the necessary concepts and tools to support other requirements such as mobility, connectivity and ubiquity. Fig. 1 shows the conceptual structure of the architecture. It is a layer-based design that enables the division of system elements into levels, reducing the coupling between modules, thus facilitating abstraction and the distribution of responsibilities. The uniform device access layer (UniDA [18]) is in charge of providing homogeneous and distributed access to the physical devices. The sensing and actuation services layer provides services that are virtual representations of sensors and actuators in the physical environment, hiding part of the complexity of the real devices. The service layer is populated by components that provide shared functionalities to other services or applications. These two service layers include tools to facilitate the development and execution of services, including a service repository, semantic service definition capabilities, service composition facilities or service discovery mechanisms. The applications layer is the highest-level layer and the one that hosts the elements representing and implementing applications that provide particular functionalities a user expects from the system. Finally, the context is a common access component for the three higher-level layers of the architecture. Its main objective is to represent the current state of the environment. A multi-agent technology based approach, supported by the JADE agent framework, was chosen in order to implement the aforementioned conceptual model. The components of the higher level layers in the HI3 architecture are implemented as collections of agents that collaborate for distributed task resolution. This implementation of HI3 has been structured as displayed in Fig. 2. It provides a container for AmI services and applications with features such as high-level inter- agent communication facilities,multi-agentmodelswith support for the declarative definition of components, development utilities and distributed management tools. This middleware promotes the division of large and complex AmI systems into highly-decoupled components that dynamically and autonomously collaborate to solve complex tasks. A more detailed description of this architecture and multi-agent platform can be found in [1,19]. A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 1975 Fig. 2. HI3 multi-agent platform. Fig. 3. HI3 mobility subsystem simplified class diagram. 3.1. HI3 mobility subsystem As indicated above, the proposed mobility solutions are implemented on top of the HI3 architecture and multi-agent platform. In this platform every component is a collection of agents considered as an atomic element that can migrate. This is a different approach fromwhat is usually done in generic multi-agent platforms, as they often take agents as their atomic components. This decision was made because in HI3 every component (application, service or sensor/actuator) is a highly- coupled collection of agents that collaborate to offer a very particular functionality. Consequently, it will generally be a good idea to keep them together in the same physical platform. HI3 follows a hybrid approach in terms of mobility. Even if all components have integrated support for migration, we are not expecting every component to be migrated; only those that make sense and will obtain some kind of benefit from a migration. This last point is within the responsibility of developers, but components that require interaction with users or the environment are usually good candidates, as they can benefit from being executed in a place that is physically near the hardware or users they have to interact with. Fig. 3 displays a simplified class diagram of the structure of the HI3-mobility subsystem. It shows the main elements of the subsystem and their relationships in the component migration process. This procedure is divided into two main sub- processes. On the one hand there is the physical migration of the component from one instance of the HI3 platform to a new one, and on the other, the adaptation of the migrated component to the new platform and physical environment. This procedure is complemented by the use of a mobile device to drive the migration process. It stores information about the user and his associated components, and proactively searches for valid platforms to deploy the components. 1976 A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 Fig. 4.Mobile User Agent block diagram. The physical component migration process is mainly managed by theMobile User Agent (MUA), the Component Mobility Manager (CMoM) and the Component Migration Manager (CMiM). The MUA hosts description information about user associated components, and searches for adequate platforms to deploy them. TheMUAuses the CMoM to access information from the guest platforms, such as available services or resources. When the MUA detects a valid platform, it contacts the host CMoM to request a migration of some components to a guest platform. The CMiMs of the two platforms are in charge of managing the transfer of component code and state. The adaptation of the migrated components to the new environment is mainly managed by the components themselves, but the system provides them with some helper capabilities. Service components are catalogued in the system registry according to their functionality. Thuswhen a component arrives in a newplatform, it can use the registry to find components in the new local platform that provide the functionalities they require. Furthermore, components can parameterize the functionality to request some specific behavior, and the registry will provide the service that best matches the desired behavior. The following subsections describe in detail the main aspects of the HI3-mobility subsystem. First, a solution based on a usermobile device to drive themigration of components is presented. Next, the details of the componentmigration strategy are shown. Finally, a solution for component adaptation to the target environment, grounded in an autonomous service composition framework, is described. 3.2. User-guided component migration TheMobile User Agent is deployed on amobile device owned by the user, currently an Android smartphone, and stores a reduced view of the user profile and the description of the components associated to him. It uses this information in order to search for appropriate platforms for the user components. When found, it commands the CMoM to migrate the component to the new platform. In the current implementation the user specifies this command, but it is a future work to extend the MUA with autonomous capabilities to select destination platforms. The MUA is a central element in the HI3 mobility process. It drives the component migration process by selecting what components to transfer and where they must be transferred. By delegating this responsibility to a user owned device, the users benefit from an increased level of privacy. In a classical AmI setup, the guest platforms available in each environment would be the ones in charge of monitoring the user state and deciding what to move, when and where. Namely, those remote and unknown platforms would have to access user information in order to be able tomake this kind of decision and thismay imply a privacy leak for the user.When using the MUA the tables are turned, and it is a user controlled software element which is the one that accesses information about the guest platforms, which are only able to access user information if the MUA decides so. Currently the MUA is implemented as an Android service and application. Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of the MUA and its interactions with the host and guest platforms. Once the smartphone is connected to a WiFi network, it uses the mDNS protocol to discover the available HI3 platforms. As the MUA is not implemented using multi-agent technologies, due to implementation constraints in Android, it uses a RESTful web service to interact with the CMoM of the guest platform. The web service has two responsibilities. On the one hand, in guest platforms it allows access to platform information such as available resources and functionalities, or software version. This information is matched with the user components and profile information, and it informs the user about what A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 1977 platforms are most suitable for each component. On the other hand, in the user host platform, it allows the MUA to access reduced views of the user information provided by the CMoM, so that it can be stored by the MUA. Regarding its implementation, on the platform side, theweb service is implemented using J2EE and theMetroweb service stack. It is deployed in a Jetty HTTP server embedded in the HI3 platformwhich allows every HI3 component to present web interfaces implemented using J2EE. On the client side it uses the Spring Android library for accessing RESTful web services. Finally, as indicated before, in order to discover the available platforms, it uses the mDNS protocol by searching for a new service type, hi3-mobility. In the client side, it uses the jmDNS JAVA library, and the platform is announced using the avahi daemon in a GNU/Linux host. 3.3. Component migration process When a CMoM receives a request to migrate one or more components to a remote platform, it relies on the CMiM (there is one for each HI3 platform) for the migration. The CMiMmust transfer the three elements that make up an HI3 component at runtime. The workspace, which is a place where the component can store persistent data, the install, which is basically the component code, required libraries and configuration files, and the runtime state of the component. The JADE agent platform, on which the HI3 multi-agent platform is based, has integrated support for agent mobility. A JADE platform is divided into agent containers, so that one platform can have multiple containers in physically different hosts, and it supports agent mobility between containers. Unfortunately all containers depend on services provided by a main container, leading to the presence of a central point of possible failure. Furthermore, every containermust bemanaged by the same administrators, so it is not possible to migrate components between platforms managed by different entities, which is a basic requirement in the case of ubiquitous computing and AmI. There exists an extension of the JADE platform to support inter-platform agent mobility [5], but it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be used in HI3 because it relies on the systemclass loader to obtain the code of the agents. HI3 uses private class loaders for each component, instead of having a single global class loader as in the case of default JADE, as a way to enforce code access privileges. This is important, not only due to security reasons, but also because it allows components to use different versions of the same code (for example libraries) without conflicting. This is especially important in open systems like those designed for AmI and even more when mobility is supported and components from different authors and users should coexist. The migration process is basically implemented by the CMiM. As represented in Fig. 5, the CMiM starts by requesting the remote platform to accept the new component. If the remote platform accepts the component, it answers with metadata about the platform, so that the local platformcan checkwhether itmatches the basic requirements of the component (mainly computing resources). Then it notifies the start of the migration process to every agent of the specified component. Each agent notifies its partners that it is going to be temporarily paused due to a migration and it then prepares its workspace for the migration and pauses its execution. When all component agents are paused, the CMiM uses JAVA serialization to serialize the state of each agent, and packs this state with the code of the classes directly used by the agent (extracted by introspection of the agent fields, methods, declared superclasses and interfaces). The state and code of each agent is sent to the new platform, which then resumes the execution of each agent. Once the agents are running in the new platform, the local platform compresses and sends the component workspace and installation directories containing the complete code of the component, aswell as the libraries and other files it requires. This transfer is carried out asynchronously and, thanks to the classes included with the agent state, agents can start running before having the complete component code. While the fewclasses sentwith the agent statemaybe enough to execute some simple agents, in the case of complex ones, they would need access to more code even before the component installation transfer is complete. To solve this problem, the class loader of the transferred agents is able to dynamically request classes from a remote CMiM (the CMiM of their previous local platform). The CMiMwill check if the requesting agent is one of themigrated agents of the component holder of the requested code, and will pack and send the class code. Once the component install transfer is finished, the remote CMiM informs the local CMiM of the successful deployment of the new component and the end of the process. Finally, the local CMiM stops the execution of the transferred component and removes its agents (which were previously paused) from the platform. 3.4. Service description model Taking a look at the overall migration process, the convenience of automating and generalizing the process of restarting the execution of the migrated components on the target platform can be immediately appreciated. Thus, the system developed here provides a common model and a set of facilities the migrated components need in order to adapt their configuration and tasks to the new execution conditions. Specifically, the mobility system manages the process in charge of discovering the most appropriate local services that provide the functionalities the migrated component needs for its execution. This whole process is supported by the semantic description capabilities provided by the HI3 Service Description Model (HI3-SDM), which facilitates the development of self-describing modular components, which can be published, automatically located and invoked across the platform. 1978 A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 Fig. 5. HI3 component migration process. The ontology based service description approach is, nowadays, the most promising solution for supporting autonomous service discovery and service composition processes [20,21]. This approach specifies services and their properties using a common model (ontology), enabling the participating entities to reason and match service concepts. Currently, there are several ontology-based languages for describing services, such as the Web Service Ontology (OWL-S) [22] and the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) [23]. Furthermore, there exist a large number of well-established service discovery protocols and service communication protocols that makes the adoption of a single technology quite an unrealistic strategy, particularly in the broad and heterogeneous field of Ambient Intelligence. Thus, interoperability between different service providers and clients, without forcing them to use a particular technology, can be accomplished using a common service description model that enables mapping among the heterogeneous service description languages. This is the solution adopted in the HI3-SDM, which proposes an abstract model inspired by the AmIi service description model [24,25]. As shown in Fig. 6, the HI3-SDM supports the specification of both functional and non-functional (i.e., QoS and security) service properties. The central element of the HI3-SDM is the functionality concept, which represents the description of any capability that can be advertised by a service or requested by a client. This description is expressed in terms of the information transformation produced by the service (inputs and outputs), the state change produced in the environment (effects) and the functionality category. These functional properties are defined referencing existing ontology concepts. In order to realize the abstract model presented in Fig. 6, a complete service model implementation based on the OWL-S (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOWL for Services\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) languagewas developed. OWL-S provides similar concepts to those defined by theHI3-SDM, anddivides the description of services into threemain aspects, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat a service does\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (service profile), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow the service is used\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (process model) and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow to interact with the service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (grounding) [26]. Fig. 7 displays some design aspects of the implemented solution. The proposed approach abstracts and automates the tedious process of specifying the grounding of the semantic services. Specifically, this implementation provides a strategy to dynamically generate a Java Grounding that enables the automatic mapping between Java objects and OWL ontology concepts. Furthermore, this Java Grounding allows for the transparent invocation of a remote service using the communications capabilities of the underlying HI3 agent platform. Finally, another important component of the HI3-SDM is the matchmaker. The objective of the matching process is to compare requested functionalities to semantically described service advertisements stored in the service registry using inference rules enabled by ontologies [27]. As a result of the matching process, a service that matches the requested A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 1979 Fig. 6. HI3 Service Description Model (HI3-SDM). Fig. 7. HI3 Service Description Model implementation grounded on OWL-S. functionalities, expressed in terms of inputs, outputs and effects, can be selected and transparently executed by the runtime environment. 1980 A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 Fig. 8. HI3 service negotiation and conflict resolution process. 3.5. Negotiation and conflict resolution strategy Once a component arrives at a new destination, it uses the HI3 Service Description Model and the system registry to find partner components to collaborate in task resolution. The arrival of new client components with different requirements could lead to conflicts with the current operation of local components. Therefore a component request negotiation and conflict resolution system was introduced. Fig. 8 summarizes the main elements of this system that are in charge of managing the adaptation of the migrated components to the new platform and environment. In this process, when a migrated component arrives at a new platform, it can use the registry of the platform to find services that provide the same functionality it was using before the migration process. For this purpose, the migrated component creates parameterized component requests that semantically describe the desired functionalities using the HI3-SDM. Additionally, each component has a collection of clients that can store a list of previous active parameterized requests (subscribers) and incorporates capabilities for managing conflicts in the access to its functionality. Thus, when a new component requests an action and there can be a conflict with some resources managed by the service, they have integrated capabilities that solve possible conflicts with other currently active clients subscribed to the service. The detailed sequence of actions for this negotiation process is shown in the activity diagram of Fig. 8. The parameter variables of each request designate different semantics about the desired action. These parameters are specified by the HI3-SDM and their meaning is dependent on the service implementation. By default, every request has an importance parameter, which designates how strong the commitment of the client is to the action requested. This parameter is used by the service in order to solve possible conflicts between different client requests. Services can instantiate a conflict resolution manager that includes different strategies to solve conflicts. In the current implementation only one strategy is available that supports the resolution of conflicts using the importance parameter and a fuzzy inference system implemented with the jFuzzyLogic library. These strategies constitute a first step towards the autonomous adaptation of systems to the changing environments envisioned in fields like ubiquitous computing, ambient assisted living, ambient intelligence or human-centered computing. The proposed negotiation and conflict resolution strategy provides HI3 components with a series of mechanisms that allow them to adapt to newenvironments,with the restriction that every environmentmust share a common semantic description model. Nevertheless, to achieve a complete solution it is necessary to improve these strategies with characteristics such as interoperability amongheterogeneous systems, computational load balancing, user and environment data privacy safeguard measures or capabilities to preserve the functional integrity of the whole system. 4. Use case scenario for component mobility In order to better illustrate the inner workings of the presented solution, the current section will show an example use case of the mobility capabilities of the HI3 platform. The example has been implementedwithin the framework of an ongoing projectwehave for the innovation in the kitchen space. The project goal is to increase the level of automation of the kitchen and its associated tasks, by taking advantage of high-end appliances and new mobile user devices, like tablets and smartphones (see Fig. 9). One of the developments of the project encourages families to follow a healthier lifestyle. It includes a Meal Planner application for Android tablets that relies on a HI3 service, which uses a catalog of healthy recipes and information of the family members (personal and health information), to create a balanced and varied plan of meals for each day of the week. For amobility use case scenario,wehave imagined a case inwhich the family is receiving a visitor for somedays. Therefore the Meal Planner should bear in mind the newmember and adapt the meal plan to his/her requirements. More specifically, A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 1981 Fig. 9. Photographs of the kitchen and tablet used for testing the development of the project. we have thought out a case where the grandfather or grandmother, who lives in a retirement home, is coming to his/her daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home for the holidays. The retirement home has implemented an Ambient Intelligence system that aids the caregivers in their daily chores. Among other things, this system allows the medical staff to manage the diet of the residents and to monitor the residents using different devices. The system uses an instance of a Resident Agent (RA) service component for each resident. This service is in charge of managing the health information of the resident, providing it to other services (for example the catering service in order to prepare themeals), as well as interacting with the different monitoring devices associated to the resident. In order to keep the example as simple and relevant as possible, we have imagined a scenario where the resident is diabetic and uses an insulin pump with a glucose sensor. The RA, when running in the resident home system, on the one hand interacts with the glucose sensor in order to obtain information about glucose levels and report it to the medical staff. On the other hand, it interacts with a Meal Planner service used by the catering staff to plan the meals for the residents. The RA service is designed as a mobile HI3 component, so, when the grandmother/grandfather arrives at the family home, he/she can use a mobile device (currently a smartphone) to transfer his/her personal services from the resident home to the family home. Thus the RA can continue interacting with the glucose sensor, and can use locally available services, like the Meal Planner, in order to adapt the system and environment to the user. Fig. 10 shows a simplified view of the internal architecture of the components involved in this use case scenario. As can be seen, the two main elements of the example are the Meal Planner service and the Resident Agent service. The former is available in the family home AmI system and provides meal-planning capabilities to the tablet application. It is composed of three different agents: a coordinator agent that interacts with external entities and coordinates the other two, a recipe catalog agent that manages a database of recipes and a recipe selector agent, that uses information about the familymembers in order to plan an appropriate and balanced selection ofmeals. The user information is received in the form of food restrictions, for example, if some member of the family should avoid salted meals or has some kind of food allergy. As the information coming from different users can lead to conflicts, it uses a conflict resolution manager to select the most important restrictions among the conflictive ones. This conflict manager relies on a fuzzy inference system, implemented with the jFuzzyLogic library, to solve the conflicts. Food restriction information can arrive to the MP from multiple sources and users. One example is the Family Diet (FD) service, which interacts with the Android application, allowing the family members to specify their restrictions. Another source of food restriction information would be the RA service when the grandfather/grandmother is in the family home. As indicated in Section 3.5, these requests are parameterized by including a fuzzy variable indicating the importance of each request for a specific user. Therefore, depending on the health state of each user, his/her associated request would specify a different level of importance, which would be used by the previously cited conflict resolution manager of the MP to solve possible conflicts. The RA is composed of four different agents. A coordinator agent, a glucose monitoring agent that relies on a glucose report agent to create reports about the glucose levels of the resident, and a food restriction agent that uses a fuzzy inference system to automatically generate a set of food restrictions using health (diseases, allergies, etc.) and personal information of the resident. The RA is designed and implemented as a moveable HI3 component, thus it contains specific logic to control the operation of the component before and after a movement takes place. Not all HI3 components are designed to support mobility, as the developers of the system decide which ones must require mobility, while the others would work remotely. When the grandfather/grandmother arrives at his/her family home, he/she uses the smartphone to start the transfer of personal services to the local available AmI system. The smartphone is automatically connected to the familyWiFi network, which is previously known, and, as specified in Fig. 5, it uses mDNS to find the available HI3 containers. When it finds a trusted one, it interacts with the resident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home AmI system through the MUA Web Service to request the transfer of the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moveable services, in this case the RA, to the family home system. At this point, the resident home system 1982 A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 Fig. 10. Use case example service components. Table 1 Transference times measured for the Resident Agent component.

The agents prepare themselves for the transfer by closing/freeing local resources. In the proposed example, the food restrictor agent will save its currently generated restrictions for use at the destination, and unload the fuzzy inference system, in order to alleviate the transfer payload. Once they have finished, the agents are paused and the transfer process begins. As shown in Fig. 5, the transfer is carried out in two different phases. First, the agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 states and directly used code is packaged compressed and transferred. After this, the agents are already available at the destination system, and their behavior execution is resumed. This behavior could be slightly limited, because not all the component code and files are available yet. Once the agents are restarted at the destination, the source platform starts the transfer of the complete component installation directory, which includes all the component code, library dependencies and data files. When the agents are restarted at the destination, the system executes a callback in each agent to notify them that they have been transferred to a new destination. Agents can execute the required logic to adapt to the new environment. In the example, the glucose monitor agent will look for a glucose sensor device and interact with it. The food restrictor agent would search for a service that offers meal planning functionally, and send a request to replan with the resident specified restrictions and parameter. Then it would wait until the complete component directory is transferred in order to again load the fuzzy inference system, which relies on files that would not be transferred alongside the agent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s code and state. These kinds of decisions, about what is transferred, and how the agent behavior is modified when running in a remote platform rely on the developers, and can be of paramount importance in order to obtain short response times when transferring components. Table 1 shows the transfer times we have measured for this example. Once the first stage is finished, the agents are already in execution at the destination. The decision to unload the fuzzy inference system, thus delaying the requirement of the jFuzzyLogic library, allows us to considerably reduce the component state in order to reduce the time that the component agents are paused. A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 1983 To finish this discussion about a possible use case scenario where ubiquity is achieved by mixing component mobility with remote access, we want to stress some of the benefits that could be obtained by transferring some user components, like the RA, to a platform physically close to the user: TheRA requires interactionwith locally available hardware, in this case the glucose sensor. By transferring themonitoring software to a local platform it can interact directly with the devices, for example using a ZigBee or Bluetooth network, without requiring any other intermediary, and effectively reducing the delays in accessing the device, which can be of paramount importance for other devices/purposes, like user interaction hardware. Even when a remote system could rely on locally available services to access devices, it could be the case that the local system does not have installed a component with the required functionality. By having the ability to move software components from one platform to another, we maximize the possibility that users can access their utilities wherever they are. Even though this was not the case in this particular example, the RA could have used locally available information, like temperature, domestic devices state, etc. This information is private to the family, and sending it to a remote platform for processing could imply a privacy leak. Privacy leaks could also happen from the other side. For example, sensitive information about the user that is transferred within agent states to remote platforms. This case could be minimized or even completely solved by programming the agents not to transfer sensitive information. For example, the RA could decide not to transfer the user health information with the food restrictor agent, and transfer only the previously generated food restrictions, which contain far less sensitive information about the user. Even if in the current implementation an internet connection is required for component transference, once transferred, they can continue operating without a network connection to the original platform. This could be useful for mobile environments like vehicles. And as future work, it is planned to allow the possibility of transferring the component state and code to the smartphone that would store them until a valid destination platform is found to restart the execution of the component. 5. Mobility solutions comparison This section relies on the information extracted from the related work presented in Section 1 in order to provide a comparison of the different approaches for component mobility. Obviously, to compare the different solutions to each other and toHI3-mobility, a comparison frameworkmust be established. Here itwas based on a set of properties thatwere taken as important characteristics that every mobile software solution should bear in mind. The characteristics are presented below and they are followed by a comparison of the different technologies along with a discussion about these results. The main characteristics or features considered in the comparison were: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Code migration. The capability of the solution to physically migrate components. It avoids the need of having the components installed on every platform and allows the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own applications to be used wherever he is. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 State migration. Related with the previous characteristic, it refers to the ability of the solution to move the state of the applications so that they can continue operating even without network connection. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Security and privacy.Mobile security and privacy measures implemented by the solution. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Environment adaptation. This category aggregates all those characteristics related to the adaptation of mobile applications to the new environments while migrating. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Runtime environment. Capability of the solution for determining if the destination platform complies with the execution requirements of a component (platform software version, memory, CPU, etc.) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Service needs. The ability to connect the migrated services to the most adequate local ones. That is, find those local services that better fulfill the requirements of the migrated services and adapt their behavior to the limitations of the available local functionalities. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Contextual adaptation. This characteristic refers to an extension of the previous ones, where the platform, user and environment situation information is used in order to optimize the adaptation of the migrated components to a local platform. For example, information about shared resource usage, user preferences or needs, etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c User interaction. This is a specialization of contextual adaptation, and represents the ability of the solution to adapt the user interface of the system to the interaction capabilities available in an environment. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Component distribution. Related to most of the characteristics of environment adaptation. It refers to the ability of the solution to select the destination of the migrated components using the previously described adaptation characteristics. This includes dividing the components of a service or application if necessary. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Task awareness. Applications and services are not used in an isolated manner, they are grouped in order to provide solutions to particular tasks the user is actively involved in, or even tasks that are proactively performed by the system in the background. These nine characteristics cover many important requirements for software mobility, especially in the Ambient Intelligence or ubiquitous computing field. Therefore they can be a good first evaluation set to establish a reasonable 1984 A.

Table 2 compares the technologies reviewed in Section 1 in terms of these characteristics. The discussion of these results can be started considering agent mobility solutions. They are the simplest ones, focused exclusively on code and state migration, they do not provide support for component adaptation and other features. This leaves a lot of responsibilities on the hands of developers, who would have to deal with all the associated issues mentioned above. Two of the solutions, Aura [11] and TaskShadow [28,10], sharemany similarities. Both use the idea of user task as a central concept, and they also take a similar technical approach. They do not migrate code and rely exclusively on available local applications and services that comply with the task requirements. The main difference between them is their application field. Aura was designed for a traditional software environment, while TaskShadow was designed for smart environments, so it provides support for context-based selection of the services, thus being a better option for AmI systems. Fluid computing solutions, like IBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluid computing [7] or FlowSGI [8], are focused on the synchronization of the applicationmodel (from aMVC point of view), so they do not implementmigration or adaptation strategies, and rely on local applications (selected by the user) to this end. Thanks to its application state synchronization capabilities, fluid computing is good for multi-user environments, but the lack of component adaptation features limits its usage in AmI environments. Its approach is very different from HI3-mobility, sharing only the ability to migrate the runtime state of the components. They are especially focused on multi-user applications with synchronized states and not really on application mobility. From a more general point of view, GAIA [12,29] is a good example of mobility support. It fully supports code and state migration, it provides capabilities to describe application requirements and search other services that match them, and it supports component distribution. Nevertheless, it does not support the use of contextual information to drive the adaptation to new environments, nor does it support task awareness. Finally, the service-oriented approach of [9] supports service replication and state synchronization between replicas. It also uses contextual information in order to allow for a more user and environment adapted migration of the services. Therefore, even though it does not support task awareness, and uses only environment sensing information as context, it is one of the most complete approaches for mobility in ubiquitous computing or AmI environments. The HI3 approach shares many similarities with GAIA and the Preuveneers approaches, but it elevates contextual information to amore prominent position, providing capabilities to solve shared resources and preference conflicts between users. HI3 also provides a complete ontological framework for service discovery and request parameterization, and includes basic support for task awareness, by grouping and managing several user services at the same time. With respect to Aura and TaskShadow, even though the lattermakes use of contextual information to drive themigration, the approach to mobility chosen by HI3 is more flexible. Aura and TaskShadow do not support code migration, which is a core feature in HI3-mobility. This feature allows users to continuously use their own applications and services, while relying on local services and devices to access local resources or improve performance. TaskShadows relies exclusively on locally available resources, thus if there is no resource that provides one of the required functionalities, the tasks cannot be moved. It is worth noting that, currently, even though the HI3-mobility approach has devoted some efforts to increasing user privacy, most solutions have done very little in terms of the security and privacy aspects of mobility. It is also important to point out that user interaction adaptation is future work for all of them. Summarizing, most efforts in the line of incorporating mobility to AmI systems are still in their infancy. After being focused on the physical migration of components and state synchronization, many solutions have started to explore the adaptation to new environments by including contextual information in their service discovery strategies. However, there are still a lot of issues that have been barely addressed such as privacy and security, resource and user preference conflicts or user interface adaptation. 6. Conclusions Ubiquity is a key characteristic of Ambient Intelligence systems. It increases the level of transparency by allowing access to system functionality independently of the user location, effectively releasing users from the management of their A. Paz-Lopez et al. / Science of Computer Programming 78 (2013) 1971\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1986 1985 applications and data. Component mobility is a prominent approach to achieve ubiquity, as it provides important benefits in areas such as system operation latency, system autonomy or user data privacy. However, these benefits are usually overlooked by the majority of AmI projects, which rely exclusively on distributed operation to achieve ubiquity. Software mobility is a complex topic but, when applied to AmI and ubiquitous computing environments, its complexity increases even more, as a whole lot of new issues related with interoperability, system autonomy, device access or security and privacy are introduced. This paper describes the support for component mobility that has been integrated in a general- purpose ambient intelligence development platformcalledHI3 architecture. Unlike other approaches, the solution presented here pays particular attention to the preservation of user privacy and preferences, and uses this information to drive the component migration process. A user-guided approach, on the one hand, enables the mobility system to take advantage of information on user preferences to optimize the matchmaking between the user software requirements and the capabilities advertised by a platform. On the other hand, by limiting the exposure of user private data to unknown third parties, it allows the minimization of privacy problems associated to user software mobility. Concerning the physical migration of components, the HI3-mobility approach adapts existing approximations to the particularities of an AmI multi-agent based platform, paying special attention to code access privileges within the platform, as well as latency and fault-tolerance issues during the mobility process. Regarding component self-adaptation, which is also an important and studied topic, the solution proposed allows components to select the most appropriate services in the target platform according to the changing execution conditions, and helps components in solving conflicts from its interaction with multiple users. A lot of work is still required in order to obtain a complete mobility solution for AmI. From extending the current developments, for example with autonomous and intelligent selection of target platforms based on non-functional requirements (i.e., QoS and security), to new developments in areas like protection of themobile components from their hosts and vice versa, user interface adaptation after amigration process or data privacy and synchronization.

Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems need to be as transparent as possible, that is, their users should perceive only the effects of the features presented to them and, in some cases, some kind of interface. They should not be conscious of how these features are implemented, from a hardware or from a software point of view. In order to obtain such a high degree of transparency, it is necessary for the system to be able to provide its services regardless of location, adapting to the environment and the context in general and to the available hardware more specifically. This is known as ubiquity, and to achieve it requires considering many aspects, from security and privacy to system interoperability. This paper is mainly focused on the development of two elements related to ubiquity: physical migration of components between different platforms together with their associated runtime state, and the adaptation of those components to the destination platform and physical environment. These solutions are being addressed within our efforts for the development of a general-purpose middleware for Ambient Intelligence in the framework of the HI3 project.

SUMMARY Recent advances in neuroscience allow us to envisage the creation of an artificial brain (BAB, for Big Artificial Brain) in order to reproduce cerebral functions without having to copy individual neurons, the complex properties of which are largely beyond our present technological capabilities. As in the human brain, we intend to combine inputs, a black box (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc mentipulator \u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) and expressive outputs. The ZISC and NeuroMem neuronal chips designed by Guy Paillet, Anne M\u00c3\u00a9nendez and IBM have been used to built a BAB of 1 million transversally and vertically interconnected neurons with a parallel architecture, as in the human cerebral cortex. Potential applications are multiple and highly promising.

Introduction Multiparticipant chat [48] is a form of chat with multiple participants conversing synchronously through textual commu- cation. It is a form of microtext (e.g., microblogs, Short Message Service (SMS), transcribed voice communications) [33], hich in turn is a subset of computer-mediated textual conversations such as email, discussion forums, and social network tes [45,48]. Multiparticipant chat has a variety of uses: recreation, business [101], distant software development collaboration [18, ,83], online courses [47], collaborative learning [7,90],gaming[14,50], technical support [107], military command and ntrol [38], and even recreation of Shakespearean plays [24]. Given its widespread use, there are many motivations for alyzing and manipulating it. For example, teachers of online courses may want to summarize what was discussed in chat r others to later review, or military command and control specialists may want to find important, urgent messages that ould be brought to a decision maker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention. Unfortunately, due to its informal, conversational nature multiparticipant at is difficult to analyze when compared to other textual communications such as email and news articles [98]. We begin this survey with definitions of chat terminology and the current research foci (Section 2), then describe mo- ations for the needs of multiparticipant chat analysis (Section 3). This is followed by examining the current state of search in this area (Section 4), and we finish with discussions of what is needed for this field to grow (Section 5). Our jective is to foster more recognition of this body of work, which has been reported in a widely dispersed set of publi- tions. Researchers in AI and related fields have addressed many problems in multiparticipant chat that are pertinent to actitioner communities, which may benefit from this progress and identify additional problems that could drive new areas AI research.

Multiparticipant chat analysis: Basic definitions and tasks Chat is a form of synchronous textual communication between a community of users. These users converse in chat oms (sometimes called channels [80,101]), which are virtual locations for chatting on the Internet and private networks. ese can be supported using, for example, tools for instant messaging (e.g., MSN Messenger, AIM), Internet Relay Chat RC), virtual game lounges (e.g., Battle.net, Steam), game environments (e.g., MUDs, MMORPGs), and collaborative learning vironments. It is also considered an old medium as MUDs have been around since the late 1970s and IRC was created in 88 [49,80]. Most chat room user interfaces follow a similar structure, with an abstract user interface shown in Fig. 1. As shown, ey include a window that lists the participants, a window that displays the history of typed messages, and a window for ping in a new message. Within the message history\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s window, messages are displayed in the chronological order that they ere received by the system, with new messages appearing at the bottom of the screen. Each user is identified by a nickname [80,101]. Depending on the service, these nicknames can either be registered, so at the nickname is unique to an individual, or unregistered, so that the nickname is available on a first-come, first-serve sis to whomever is online at the time. Users may also be able to change their nickname while online. Users interact with each other through messages. User messages generally consist of three parts: the nickname identifying e message\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s author, the timestamp of their communication, and their authored utterance. An utterance can be of any length to the limit of the supporting application, with some of these limits being small (e.g., IRC only allows for utterances up to 0 bytes [55]). In addition to messages between users, there can also be system messages, which are system-generated (e.g., nouncing a user entering or leaving the chat room), and action messages (also known as emotes), which are third-person scriptions of a chat user performing some action (e.g., \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sam is smiling at you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). An example of these types of messages n be seen in Fig. 1. There are two modes of chat: dyadic and multiparticipant [48]. Dyadic chat involves two people communicating directly ith each other without other participants in the same chat room. Multiparticipant chat involves three or more people mmunicating within the same chat room, which is this survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus. Multiparticipant chat involves challenges that do t exist in dyadic chat. For example, multiparticipant chat may involve multiple, asynchronous, and simultaneous conver- tions, with messages interwoven among the various conversations [46]. A conversation thread is a sequence of messages among users conversing with one another, with messages being relevant one another within the conversation [8,49]. New conversations are started in two ways: either with a conversation- itiating statement or through a schism [35]. A schism occurs when a conversation splits into two conversations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the new nversation is formed due to certain participants branching off from a specific message, refocusing their attention upon ch other. Examples of these can are shown in Fig. 2. Four conversations take place in this chat log. Threads 1, 2, and 3 e each started by a conversation-initiating statement. Thread 4 is the result of a schism, with user Supertemp asking er Aquagirl what is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lubuntu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd due to her earlier statement, resulting in a second conversation about Lubuntu. We will me back to this example later when discussing the difficulties of overcoming entangled conversation threads. A chat room can have a theme or topic that describes the types of discussion intended for the given room, which may metimes be shown explicitly. This can be of importance when determining if a conversation or message is appropriate or topic for the chat room. Conversation threads and individual messages can also have their own topics, though these arenerally not explicitly stated like the topic of a chat room. 10 Ta Co 2.1 th fu nu Da \u00e2\u20ac\u0153* lo se in th th an co H ca be un ne an8 D.C.

Metadata Abbreviations Restricted Synchronous Entangled & Emoticons Length Threads Email Newsgroups Message Boards Transcribed Conversations SMS Microblogs IM (Dyadic Chat) Multiparticipant Chat . Comparison to other media Chat messages possess characteristics that differ from some other forms of text communication. Werry [101] described ese characteristics as the frequent use of abbreviations, acronyms, clipped words, and deletion of subject pronouns. He rther remarked on the use of emoticons (e.g., smiley faces), abbreviation of nicknames, stripping of vowels to reduce the mber of keystrokes, and the creative use of capitalization, spelling, and punctuation to recreate voice, gesture, and tone. net et al. [25] commented that words used as actions or sounds are often emphasized with asterisks (e.g., \u00e2\u20ac\u0153*waves*\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and boom*\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Wong and Xia [102] noticed the use of words composed of both letters and numbers that phonetically replace nger words (e.g., \u00e2\u20ac\u0153l8r\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153later\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) along with the dynamic introduction of new chat terms. Dela Rosa and Ellen [26] ob- rved that chat grammar is comparatively informal and unstructured in comparison to traditional text, with users engaging a conversational tone. Chat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s characteristics also differentiate it from spoken discussions. Reid [80] noted that it is not possible to transmit rough chat the non-verbal attributes of speech required for synchronous communications. Smith et al. [85] commented at chat, compared to spoken interaction from a conversational analysis perspective, was poor at: managing interruptions d turn taking; conveying comprehension between users; and resolving conflicts of floor control. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill and Martin [73] mmented that in text chat, users would begin new topics at will, which differed with face-to-face group discussions. erring [46] argued that the interactional incoherent nature of chat is due to the lack of simultaneous feedback (i.e., a user nnot know what another user is typing until the other has sent their message). Danet et al. [25] discussed how chat can viewed as a play, with the nicknames being a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mask that enables them to converse through a virtual persona, like how they would in the real world. Chat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s characteristics overlap with and differ from other forms of microtext and conversational media such as email, wsgroups, and message boards. Table 1 summarizes these comparisons. Unlike multiparticipant chat, email, newsgroups,d message boards are usually not restricted in message length and are asynchronous.

Topology of multiparticipant chat analysis research. ve metadata available to them that prevent thread entanglement. Multiparticipant chat is most similar to microblogs, S, and instant messaging. One key different between chat (dyadic or multiparticipant) and microblogs is that microblogs d SMS can use metadata. For example, Twitter has special word functions, such as hash tags for topics and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153@\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd aracter to represent a twitter name. SMS metadata identifies the recipients of the message. Another difference between ultiparticipant chat and these other three similar mediums is that chat suffers from entangled conversation threads, which akes analysis of messages more difficult. 2. Chat corpora Chat corpora, composed of chat logs (a recording of messages within a chat room), are used for chat research. There e three types of chat corpora: non-annotated, annotated, and synthetic. The first, non-annotated, can be obtained in two ays. One way is by obtaining previously logged chat corpora, for example GNUe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IRC archive [107]. The other way is by tering a chat room and logging the messages. A problem with using self-collected data is that it makes it difficult to mpare different approaches as many self-collected corpora are not made publicly available. Unfortunately, a large majority previous research has used self-collected, non-public data. The second category of chat corpora is annotated. At this time, we are familiar with only three public sources which have en used for AI-related research. One is the NPS Chat Corpus collected by Lin [63], which was later annotated with part-of- eech tagging by Forsyth and Martell [39]. These chat logs involve general chat in rooms specified by age groups. The other o (unnamed) corpora are both annotated for conversation threads and are composed of chat rooms involving technical scussions. One of the two consists of three sets, namely #IPHONE, #PHYSICS, and #PYTHON, which were obtained by ams [2]. The other corpus is the #LINUX corpus, which was obtained by Elsner and Charniak [35]. The third type of chat corpora is synthetic (i.e., they were composed using synthetic data instead of real conversations). rly examples are corpora created by Acar et al. [1] and \u00c3\u2021amtepe et al. [21]. Both groups modeled a chat room using atistical analysis of real chat logs. Another example was described by Dela Rosa and Ellen [26]. They created a chat corpus at includes messages with synthetic status updates from US Navy ships. As previously mentioned, most prior research studies have used non-annotated corpora. We believe this is due to the ease obtaining such corpora and the difficulty of obtaining annotated or creating synthetic corpora. The problems associated ith this will be further discussed in Section 5.1. 3. Artificial intelligence research foci We now describe the many AI research foci on analyzing multiparticipant chat. AI techniques have been extensively used analyze chat, including methods relating to natural language processing, classification, clustering, and machine learning. general, AI researchers are interested in understanding and manipulating the contents of chat messages. In this section, e will define only what the foci are that are of current research interest. Section 3 will describe motivations for these search tasks and Section 4 will describe the progress that has been made on each of them. Future possible tasks that have t been a focus of AI research will be discussed in Section 5.4. A topology of these foci can is shown in Fig. 3. We consider low-level analysis to be tasks which are needed for high- vel analysis tasks. While many of these research tasks (e.g., topic detection, automatic summarization) are also tasks found other text-processing domains, there are new challenges found here that make it difficult to apply traditional techniques multiparticipant chat in contrast to more traditional forms of written communication [3,13,26,82,91,98,99,107]. We define chat preprocessing as the task of preparing chat messages for analysis. Chat preprocessing techniques include pernym augmentation (generalizing words into more generic terms) [3], lemmatizing (mapping inflected forms of word a common root) [26], stemming (removing the ending of words to find their common form) [9],stopwordremoval[90],d phonetic mapping [102]. 11 m 36 ve th a is w di (e 39 a of in to nu 3. hi fro 3.1 th an Ex ar in ov m fo sc a on in 3. st ne us of ch of of (i.

Aha / Artificial Intelligence 199\u00e2\u20ac\u201c200 (2013) 106\u00e2\u20ac\u201c121 We define chat room feature processing as the task of leveraging chat room characteristics to find relationships among essages. This includes features such as time stamps [3,35,36,70,100], nickname augmentation [3,35], name mentions [35, ,70,90,99], and speaker identity [36]. Thread disentanglement [35] is the task of detecting and extracting individual conversation threads from interwoven con- rsations in chat. Using Fig. 2 as an example, the goal of thread disentanglement is to group the twenty-two messages into eir respective four conversations. The text mining task, topic detection and tracking, was defined as the task of detecting and tracking new events within stream of news stories [5]. In this context, topic detection has been changed to accommodate the nature of chat: the task to detect which topics are being actively discussed within a chat room or chat log. This can be viewed as determining hich topics have been discussed over a period of time, or examining an entire chat log and detecting which topics were scussed within it. Message attribute identification is the task of detecting attributes of a chat message. Examples are sentence type tagging .g., declarative sentence, conditional sentence) [82], dialogue act tagging (e.g., greeting, system message, Wh-question) [17, ,103], part-of-speech tagging [39], and identifying important messages [10,13,26]. User profiling is the task of determining the profile, or characteristics, of a chat user. Given a set of messages authored by user, the goal is then determine certain characteristics under study which are hidden due to chat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anonymity. Examples this includes detecting a users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gender or age [60,63,88], or a users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 topic interests [9]. Social phenomenon detection is the task of detecting social phenomenon taking place between the users. Examples of this clude detecting social networks [20,70], determining if a user is deceptive [93], or if a user exhibits social abilities such as pic control and leadership [87]. Automatic summarization is the task of creating a textual summary from a textual source [64,86]. In chat, this can be any mber of messages, such as within a period of time or within a conversation thread [94,107]. Motivations for chat research Having introduced chat concepts, we next discuss how it is used and how it has been studied. The purpose of this is to ghlight the importance of chat analysis research, and to motivate its need. In the following, we summarize perspectives m users interacting with chat, users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behavior and characteristics, online learning, and military use. . Chat interaction One area of research concerns how users interact with chat, especially through their clients. There are many challenges at a user must overcome when reading chat, such as its threaded conversations, its synchronous nature, turn taking, d topic change [46,73]. Some researchers have approached these problems by investigating alternative user interfaces. amples of this include using graphical circles to represent a user and restricting conversations to groups of users who e in near proximity [96]; showing real-time updates of someone typing [97]; displaying chat horizontally on a timeline stead of vertically [97]; and hybridizing chat with Usenet-like postings [85]. Essentially, these approaches are trying to ercome the problem of entangled conversation threads by changing how the user interacts with the client. Unfortunately, many of these ideas have limitations. For example, when hybridizing chat with Usenet-like postings, new essages appeared within their respective conversation thread instead of at the bottom of the screen, making it difficult r users to predict where new messages would appear [85]. In the interface used by Vi\u00c3\u00a9gas and Donath [96], the messages roll across the screen horizontally. Users felt that the messages moved off the screen too quickly when compared to traditional vertical scroll. Not surprisingly, most chat clients still use a traditional interface. We expect that research thread disentanglement may lead to intelligent clients that allow users to more easily follow conversation threads of terest. 2. User behavior and characteristics Multiparticipant chat analysis has been the focus of substantial research in the social and behavioral sciences, where udies have examined chat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on people and the benefits gained from its use. This has included areas such as social tworks [77], cultural impact (e.g., Thai [76], Japanese [57], Lithuanian and Croatian [106]), gender differences of chat ers [56,57,76,106], language variation (e.g., regional speech in Germany [6]; code-switching in German-speaking regions Switzerland [84] and Indian IRC channels [77]), and user preferences in strategic games [14]. A common theme of these research papers is that these studies often require a lot of manual tagging and processing of at logs or are restricted by the limited ability of the programs to process chat logs. For example, in the gender studies, tentimes the authors manually determine the gender of each user using clues based on the nicknames and the contents their messages. Even the recent work by Holmer [51], which attempts to introduce automation, still requires a key task e., the threading of the conversations) to be performed manually. Siebenhaar [84], when investigating code-switching hanging between languages within a conversation), used a program to automatically tag words in the data, but it was stricted to a small number of words due to the program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to disambiguate many of the words. This manual labord weak automation limits the amount of chat logs that can be examined. New techniques, such as author profiling and mbe 3. w ex st di to en gr se (i w 3. na an ch ar re O Ir da it ba ca 31 ta in N tr te m ch ex is m re of (e 4. Th m ca an si do spD.C. Uthus, D.W.

Online learning Another area of focus has concerned online learning, where chat is used for discussions among teachers and students, ith mixed results [15,47,74,90]. While studies found that students maintained focus on what is being discussed [47], plaining concepts took longer compared to face-to-face conversations, it required more effort by the instructors, and the udents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work quality was lower than the instructors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations [74].Someprogramshavebeendevelopedtovisualize fferent aspects of chat in online learning, but many of these tools require manually annotating chat logs in order for them visualize the area under study [15,47]. Online learning has also been used for language learning, as chats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 anonymity is an equalizer for users, which can courage people to practice more [54,89]. The first of these studies required an artificial limit on the number of chat users ouped together in order to prevent thread entanglement, which research on thread disentanglement could alleviate. The cond required manual coding of chat logs to investigate a users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to clear up misunderstandings with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repair moves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd .e., methods of user interactions to clarify a statement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meaning that was due to the difficulties of non-native speakers), hich motivates the need for message attribute identification. 4. Military The military has a long-term interest in chat analysis. In this section, we focus on the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 military. While other tions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 militaries also use chat for communications, we are most familiar with the unclassified literature on military chat alysis from this nation. We report on chat use in the military since it offers a unique, well-documented history of how at changed the modes of communication within a group of collaborators, along with the benefits and problems that have isen since its introduction. The use of chat communications has grown quickly across all branches of the US military in recent years [38].With spect to the Navy, chat was first used in 1994 for technical and administrative support. Its use then exploded during peration Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and it further revolutionized command and control operations during Operation aqi Freedom [30,38,44,53,67]. Duffy and Bilbrey [29] estimated that up to 60,000 Navy personnel use chat systems on a ily basis. The rise in popularity of chat for command and control communications can be attributed to its many benefits: s ease of use, its ability to support information sharing among large numbers of concurrent users, it decreases language rriers in coalition operations, it increases the effectiveness of scheduling and coordination among distributed teams, it n be saved and documented for subsequent analysis, and its reliability under high latency, low bandwidth situations [30, ,38,44,61]. In addition to these benefits, chat has also caused some difficulties. First, it can distract users from their primary sks [12,23,61]. For example, Cummings [23] reported that Tactical Tomahawk operators focused on the task of chatting stead of their primary task of missile control. Second, chat can contribute to information overload [61,67].Forexample, avy watchstanders, who monitor chat rooms in addition to their other duties of monitoring multiple displays and radio affic, monitor up to 20 chat rooms simultaneously [67]. Some investigators have suggested creating intelligent tools and chniques to aid chat users, such as with advanced alerting systems [67], automated highlighting of critical messages which ay be missed in high-tempo situations [19], and automated analysis of chat messages [13]. Finally, the high number of at messages can complicate analysis. For example, after the completion of training exercises, instructors need to quickly tract information from chat logs to incorporate into reports called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153after action reviews\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A large amount of chat data created during a training exercise, making it challenging to find relevant messages for the different trainees and their issions [27,78,79]. The military has substantial interest with respect to chat analysis. For example, analysis of chat logs would benefit from search on thread disentanglement and topic detection. In addition, the military domain suffers from a unique situation information overload that is not widely seen in non-military domains, resulting in the need to solve new analysis tasks .g., message attribute identification and automatic summarization). Current state of multiparticipant chat analysis We next describe the current state of multiparticipant chat analysis, examining the research foci defined in Section 2.3. ere are many difficulties when approaching these research tasks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d traditional techniques often do not work in this edium. For example, Wang et al. [98] discussed how the text mining techniques for topic detection and tracking, which n be used on regular documents and broadcast news, are not applicable to chat due to its unique characteristics. Tuulos d Tirri [91] commented that traditional models for topic detection failed to leverage the social network aspect of chat nce they focused only on the textual content. Wang and Oard [99] explained that conventional lexical-based clustering es not work well for text streams because such messages are too short and are incomplete. Thus, these challenges haveurred AI research to create new techniques for chat analysis. 11 4.1 un te ph Fo in de an ch Th ei 4. to he to ar th M m m Al co an in th ar fre be ex he ty di 4. ac in m O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pe of si di ge re W su2 D.C.

Chat preprocessing Chat preprocessing techniques overlap a lot with the techniques used for other forms of microtext \u00e2\u20ac\u201d normalizing the usual, informal textual features of the chat messages to make them more amenable for traditional analysis. Many of the chniques that have been applied are the same as seen in traditional natural language processing. One approach though, onetic mapping, was created to address features rarely seen in traditional text. Phonetic mapping can be applied to words and numbers to define the meaning of words with unusual spellings [102]. r example, the mixed word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153l8r\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be phonetically mapped to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153later.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This differs from traditional spell checking [22] that phonetic mapping does not use n-gram analysis or examine possible mutations of a word through insertion and letion of characters. Instead, phonetic mapping uses phonetic mappings of both the target word and dictionary word, d calculates the probability of one mapping to the other. Wong and Xia [102] applied this to Chinese text, where roman aracters and some Chinese characters can be used phonetically to represent words found in a standard Chinese dictionary. eir models achieved high normalization accuracy and the authors discussed possible errors in the models resulting from ther ambiguous chat terminology or chat words that were created through some process other than phonetic mapping. 2. Chat room feature processing As mentioned earlier, chat room feature processing aims to leverage additional information about chat rooms. It is used find relationships among messages, which is important for applications like thread disentanglement, where relationships lp determine conversations, and topic detection, where the commonality of messages can help determine their general pic. For example, Elsner and Charniak [36] mentioned that for thread disentanglement, time stamps and speaker identities e better cues than the contents of the messages in determining whether messages belong within the same conversation read. Time stamps can be used can be used to find relations among messages through penalization of the time gap distance. essages that are far apart in time are less likely to be related to each other while messages that are close together are ore likely to be related. Nickname augmentation, which focuses on the messages\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 authors, assumes multiple messages by the same author are ore likely to be within the same conversation. Our example in Fig. 2 is both a positive and negative example of this. l of the messages by users mmc_, DarwinSurvivor, MacDaddy, and Supertemp are located each within a single nversation, while users dr_willis, AquaGirlLove, and ActionP have messages in multiple conversation threads. Name mentions are commonly used at the start of chat messages; they specifically address another user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nickname (i.e., intended recipient). Name mentions can be used to find explicit links between messages. An example of this is shown Fig. 2, where some of the messages begin with the user name of the intended recipient. Speaker identity assumes that conversations are dominated by a few speakers who speak frequently. This is built on e assumption that a small subset of the users in the chat room are involved in a conversation, and that most messages e spoken by a few core speakers. Speaker identity can aid in thread disentanglement, where a few speakers speaking quently are probably within the same conversation. These four chat room features have been found to be useful; they help to create additional information for analysis yond just the content of the messages. What is unknown though is when is it beneficial to use these features. For ample, comparing chat from a social channel with chat from a technical support channel, which of these features would lp with disentangling conversation threads, and which of these would hinder? Comparisons of these features on different pes of chat logs would be of great benefit in helping researchers know which chat room features they should use for fferent situations. 3. Thread disentanglement Thread disentanglement addresses a major problem of multiparticipant chat: it lacks the type of turn-taking that char- terizes spoken communications, which can cause threads to become entangled so that individual threads are frequently terrupted by irrelevant messages [46]. In addition, further complications arise with initiating messages and responses: ultiple responses may target a single initiating message and a single response may target multiple initiating messages [46]. Neill and Martin [73] additionally noted that participants begin new threads spontaneously, which does not always hap- n in spoken group discussion. The authors also found that chat users could hold coherent discussions despite the presence simultaneous conversations. Disentangling conversation threads allows for subsequent analysis techniques to focus on single conversations. This as- sts with popular AI tasks such as topic detection and automatic summarization. The approaches presented here also have fferent capabilities. Some can be used online, allowing for dynamic interfaces (e.g., [3,35,82]). These are approaches that nerally work incrementally with chat messages, and as such can work with live messages or be used on previously- corded chat logs. Other approaches are limited to only working with static chat logs (e.g., [27,36,37,78]). Thread disentanglement is most commonly studied using clustering methods. Shen et al. [82], Wang and Oard [99], and ang et al. [98] used single-pass clustering. Starting with the first message as the first cluster, their algorithms assign eachbsequent message to an existing cluster if the similarity of the message to the cluster exceeds a threshold, or otherwise as in an th al si ba a cl th to of di po st as ta F- th # tw co th se th th se be ne be ap ex an ch pr ti th th th ea bu ba Ra m m in fa co us di c- gr bu unD.C. Uthus, D.W. Aha / Artificial Intelligence 199\u00e2\u20ac\u201c200 (2013) 106\u00e2\u20ac\u201c121 113 signs them to a new cluster. Shen et al. represented the messages using a vector space model with term frequency- verse document frequency (TF-IDF). They used the similarity of the vectors for each message along with sentence types d personal pronouns to determine the probability of a message belonging to a conversation. Wang and Oard expanded read messages using social and temporal contexts, and used the expanded messages as the basic unit for their clustering gorithm. Wang et al.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clustering algorithm performs two steps when receiving a new message. The first step performs ngle-pass clustering, while the second cycles through all conversations and renews the associations between messages sed on the new message. This allows messages to be re-clustered whenever the cluster containing the new message has stronger relationship with a given message. Elsner and Schudy [37] and Elsner and Charniak [35] both used correlation clustering for disentanglement. Correlation ustering finds a set of clusters that maximizes the number of agreements between pairs within a cluster and maximizes e number of disagreements among pairs in different clusters. Both approaches use the same maximum-entropy classifier determine if two messages are related. Elsner and Schudy used greedy methods and local search for the NP-hard problem finding a good solution for correlation clustering, and tested their method on topic clustering in newsgroups and chat sentanglement. When processing the data, their approach conducts multiple passes with random permutations. They re- rted that using a combined greedy method with post-processing by local search achieved the best performance for their udy. Elsner and Charniak [35] used a voting schema for correlation clustering. They processed messages incrementally they were received. These two publications applied their thread disentanglement techniques to the same thread disen- nglement #LINUX corpus as did Wang and Oard [99]. Of these three approaches, Wang and Oard reported the highest score. This may be because their method expands the messages in order to exploit social and temporal contexts. A recent approach by Elsner and Charniak [36] examined disentangling chat with coherence models. They tested eir models on both recorded telephone conversations and the four chat corpora for thread disentanglement: #LINUX, IPHONE, #PHYSICS, and #PYTHON. Their approach used tabu search to find a solution for this problem. They conducted o sets of experiments with each chat corpus: disentangling a single message (assuming the rest of the chat log has the rrect structure) and disentangling an entire chat log. When disentangling a single message, their approach did better an previous approaches [35] applied to the same corpora. When disentangling an entire chat log, they reported that tabu arch performed poorly when compared to previous approaches [35,37,99] and simple baseline approaches \u00e2\u20ac\u201d biases in eir model caused it to create too many new conversation threads. Another recent approach by Mayfield et al. [65] approached thread disentanglement using a two-pass algorithm. In e first pass, their approach would label sentences using a negotiation framework, which would then be used to detect quences using a single-pass clustering algorithm similar to Shen et al. [82]. In the second pass, these sequences would grouped together into conversation threads using a cluster classifier. Their approach achieved results that approached ar-human performance on an annotated, self-collected corpus. Wang et al. [100] and Adams and Martell [3] both used connectivity matrices to establish parent-child relationships tween posts. They also both used a standard TF-IDF term vector representation to compute message similarity. Their proaches first create a similarity matrix of the messages, and then create a directed graph of the messages, where link istence depends on whether message similarity exceeds a threshold value. Wang et al. created four approaches: a baseline d three extensions of the baseline using different methods to penalize time-distance between messages. Tests on synthetic at data (they used newsgroup postings stripped of their associated metadata) showed that leveraging this information im- oved the baseline algorithm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to recover threads. Adams and Martell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach leveraged hypernym augmentation, me-distance penalization, and nickname augmentation to determine whether a message belongs to a thread. They found at time-distance penalization had the largest impact on increasing the F-scores of their algorithm. A couple of investigations have approached thread disentanglement from a military perspective. In tactical chat from e military domain, conversation threads can be organized around missions [28]. Duchon and Jackson [27] approached e problem of thread disentanglement using a modified semi-supervised clustering approach, with the clusters based on ch individual mission. When training on an annotated corpus, their approach had precision and recall scores around 80%, t these scores dropped when it was instead trained on an unannotated corpus. They found this to be due to the way ckground information was leveraged, and that the algorithm also confuses targets that have near-identical descriptions. machandran et al. [78] extended Adams and Martell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [3] work on message representation by leveraging military-related ission keywords to create initial sets of clusters. They created a multi-pass algorithm, developed from interviewing subject- atter experts, that finds conversations related to specific missions. Some research investigations have looked at subproblems of thread disentanglement. Khan et al. [58] focused on find- g conversation-initiating messages using pattern matching with manually-created patterns. Unfortunately, their approach iled to find many of these messages. Acar et al. [1] and \u00c3\u2021amtepe et al. [21] both focused on finding the group of users nversing together in a conversation thread without having to analyze the contents of the messages themselves. They ed synthetic data composed of chat room models with assumptions to relax the problem (e.g., assuming a user will only scuss one topic during their time in the chat room). Acar et al. used an unsupervised clustering algorithm called fuzzy means for this task. \u00c3\u2021amtepe et al. implemented two algorithms, both of which use a clustering subroutine, to find the oups. Both the approaches by Acar et al. and \u00c3\u2021amtepe et al. were able to find groups of users with high levels of accuracy, t it is uncertain how well they would perform on real data due to the abstractions of the chat room models. Thread disentanglement has received the most of research attention so far on multiparticipant chat analysis, which isderstandable considering how important it is to this research area. It has benefited recently from having a common 11 de ap an de te of re m 4. to in to H to de ca ch re an of Ve lo tr th of th cl im et co ch ve co tr Co fin co ne w th w to w pr to w Th to ne co ac4 D.C.

Aha / Artificial Intelligence 199\u00e2\u20ac\u201c200 (2013) 106\u00e2\u20ac\u201c121 finition of the problem and from having publicly-available annotated corpora, allowing researchers to compare their proaches with one another. However, there are some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The definition by Elsner d Charniak [35] is becoming the standard definition, which views the problem as a clustering task. Unfortunately, this finition does not address how to determine how to cluster messages when a schism occurs, which they recognized. An al- rnative suggestion, as the authors mention, is to view the problem of thread disentanglement by dropping the viewpoint clustering (or partitioning) and instead use a graph-based approach, linking children and parent utterances with the edges presenting the strength of the relationship. There may be other alternatives that can better address this issue and which ay then improve performance in this research area. 4. Topic detection There are features of chat that make topic detection difficult when compared to news events. As chat is dynamic, multiple pics can be simultaneously active and this set will change over time. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill and Martin [73] described how topic change chat differs from real-life conversations, where people will often use discourse devices to change the topic or propose a pic based on a previous utterance. In chat, there are fewer constraints; new topics can be started whenever a user desires. erring [46] observed that topics decayed quickly in chat. Topic detection has many uses. For example, it could be used to assist in dynamic topic analysis [47], which is used determine whether chat participants are staying on topic. Trausan-Matu et al. [90] leveraged topic detection to aid in termining which topics were being discussed in the context of computer supported collaborative learning. Topic detection n be used to help users find rooms of interest. This is reminiscent of the Butterfly chat tool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal [95]; it helps users find at rooms that match their interests by sampling public chat rooms, building term vectors of the rooms, and then making commendations to the user based on their likes and dislikes. Topic detection can also be used to assist with building user d chat room profiles. One approach to finding topics involves using supervised learning methods, which classify messages according to a set pre-determined topics. Elnahrawy [34] investigated three such techniques: Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support ctor Machines (SVM). These were applied to both chat logs and newsgroup postings, with the goal being to classify a g to a pre-determined topic. For both applications, Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes classifiers recorded the highest accuracies, had shorter aining times than the SVM, and shorter classification times than k-Nearest Neighbor. \u00c3\u2013zyurt and K\u00c3\u00b6se [75] examined ese same techniques for topic detection in chat composed in the Turkish language. They leveraged Khan et al.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [58] idea pattern matching to find threads that improve the performance of the supervised learning approaches. Unlike Elnahrawy, ey were classifying individual messages, and in this context, SVMs were found to high higher accuracy than the other two assifiers. Tuulos and Tirri [91] investigated using a SVM for this problem. They leveraged the idea of social networks to prove performance, and reported small improvements in accuracy when the social networks were applied. Anjewierden al. [7] used a Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes classifier to classify messages into categories in an educational domain consisting of students llaboratively learning. They used both automated and manual processes to reduce the noise (e.g., misspellings) in their at data before training and evaluating their classifier. Durham [32] used Latent Dirichlet Allocation models as feature ctors for a SVM. They focused on a binary classification task for chat posts, and found their approach worked best when nsidering all posts by a user as a single document. Unsupervised learning approaches can also be used to identify topics. Their advantage is that they do not require labeled aining data, and can identify topics that have not previously been found. For example, Kolenda et al. [59] used Independent mponent Analysis (ICA) to find topics in a stream of chat. They applied ICA to a day of chat from a news website to d keywords of topics discussed during that day. Bingham et al. [11] presented another unsupervised approach using mplexity pursuit, which is closely related to ICA. They reported tests with both an unlabeled chat stream and a labeled wsgroup data (the labels allowed for numerical measurements in evaluation). The latter tests showed that their approach as the most successful among those compared for recognizing topically different newsgroup articles. Trausan-Matu et al. [90] created a tool for computer supported collaborative learning that can discover new topics when ey are introduced during a conversation. Their approach consists of finding frequent words in the chat after irrelevant ords are removed. Topics are found by leveraging synonyms to find common words, searching for patterns among the pics that are dynamically introduced, and from user feedback. Bengel et al. [9] created ChatTrack, a tool that archives chat logs and creates profiles of the logs and users. These logs ere collected by a bot, which sat in various IRC chat rooms and recorded the messages. This data was then used to create ofiles, both in terms of the session and the various users, using a vector space classifier. These profiles would contain the pics being discussed either in the chat session or in the messages spoken by the user. While there have been many research investigations in topic detection on chat, it is unfortunately impossible to know hich approaches work best. This is due to the lack of a public corpus which that could be used for comparative evaluation. at is, the research investigations presented here used self-collected data, and, to our knowledge, there has been no effort make a public corpus for this research topic. Additionally, there is a lack of analysis on whether one can apply traditional techniques to chat, or if there are extensions eded to traditional algorithms due to chat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual characteristics. The only analysis we are aware of are the evaluations nducted by Tuulos and Tirri [91] in which they investigated whether inferring social networks increased classificationcuracy. Other researchers addressed this issue, such as \u00c3\u2013zyurt and K\u00c3\u00b6se [75], who considered conversation threads, and ACo sp 4. in ac ex Th ac us fo gl ho et in em de ne di un ba pr ha th cl un m am an ut m SV 4. la yo in no Th ge N le de 4. th an w anD.C.

[7], who reduced noise in chat data, but they did not report results of whether this made a difference. nsidering the popularity and the need for topic detection, it would beneficial for future investigations to determine if ecial extensions are required for chat data. 5. Message attribute identification Message attribute identification is used to examine messages to identify an attribute under study. One area that has been vestigated is techniques for tagging words and messages, i.e., part-of-speech tagging, sentence type tagging, and dialogue t tagging. Part-of-speech tagging concerns tagging at the individual word level. For example, Forsyth and Martell [39] amined supervised learning techniques (i.e., leveraging previously-tagged text documents) to train a part-of-speech tagger. ey included new tags for this parser to cover additional words not found in more formal documents (e.g., emoticons, ronyms, commonly misspelled words). Sentence type tagging determines the type of a sentence (e.g., declarative sentence, conditional sentence). Shen et al. [82] ed simple heuristics to determine the types of sentences. For messages composed of multiple sentences, the authors cused only on the first and last sentence of the message, as they were using sentence type tagging for thread disentan- ement. Sentence type tagging did improve their performance on thread disentanglement, but the authors did not report w accurate their heuristics were in tagging sentence types. Dialogue act tagging determines the type of act of a sentence (e.g., greeting, system message, Wh-question). Wu al. [103] created templates that were fed into a Transformation-Based Learning algorithm (a greedy, rule-based learn- g algorithm) to learn how to tag sentences. In their work, they included dialogue acts that are specific to chat: emotion, phasis, and system (i.e., system messages). Forsyth and Martell [39] examined dialogue-act tagging with the same tags as scribed by Wu et al. [103]. They applied a back-propagation neural network and a Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes algorithm, finding that the ural network performed better at classifying messages into the set of dialogue acts. Carpenter and Fujioka [17] examined alogue-act tagging using a larger set of dialogue act types. As with Wu et al. [103], they described four dialogue act types ique to chat: action description, completion, correction, and attention. The authors created a set of hand-coded rules sed on patterns seen in their corpus, which were then used in a rule-based pattern-matching approach. While their ap- oached worked well for their corpus, the authors warned that the high performance was because the users in the corpus d developed a shared vocabulary and common patterns of interaction, which might not be seen in other environments. A few research efforts have focused on urgency detection \u00e2\u20ac\u201d more specifically, finding messages of importance so that ey can be brought to a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention. Berube et al. [10] combined regular expressions, information extraction, and entity asses within a system to detect important messages in military chat logs. Budlong et al. [13] leverage cues to identify certainty and urgency within a chat message. They compared a rule-based algorithm, a statistical analysis approach using aximum entropy, and a combined approach to accomplish this task. The maximum entropy approach had the highest recall ong the three, but the combined approach recorded a much higher precision and the highest overall F-score. Dela Rosa d Ellen [26] compared four different classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor, SVM, Rocchio, and Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes) for classifying chat terances. Their goal was to classify messages into either non-important messages containing only social chat or important essages containing social chat interspersed with a Navy ship update. Their results showed the k-Nearest Neighbor and M classifiers performed best for this task. 6. User profiling User profiling aims to discover properties about a user despite the anonymity of chat. One application involves helping w enforcement personnel to locate sexual predators (i.e., automated detection of possible older participants preying on uths and children [63,88]). Another application concerns social analysis; automated methods for detecting gender can aid studying the impact of gender in chat, as discussed in Section 3.2. Lin [63] examined age and gender detection using Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes classifiers, though results showed their approach did t significantly outperform a baseline approach. Tam [88] used Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes classifiers and SVMs to detect a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age. eir results showed that, in general, SVMs outperformed the Na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes classifier on their task. K\u00c3\u00b6se et al. [60] examined nder identification in Turkish chat. They used a discrimination function with semantic analysis, and compared it against a\u00c3\u00afve Bayes and SVM classifiers. Their approach obtained a higher accuracy than the other classifiers for this problem with ss computation time. Related to topic detection is determining which topics a user is interested in. As mentioned earlier, Bengel et al. [9] veloped the tool ChatTrack, which creates user profiles. These profiles can be used to identify the topic interests of a user. 7. Social phenomenon detection Social phenomenon detection is important for finding social interactions that go beyond a single user. One example of is is detecting social networks among users. \u00c3\u2021amtepe et al. [20] describe an in-situ bot that creates profiles of the users d chat rooms. It records the number of messages a user sent within a time interval. Using this information, it then infers ho was talking with whom during a particular time interval and tries to discover communities. Mutton [70] presentsIRC bot called PieSpy. It collects chat room data and uses it to heuristically infer relationships among users to create a 11 so ar po co as co in th m de tig de in ex bu th re 4. us an To au Se th ch ha ch in us it lin ch sc su 5. ar lo co an 5.1 da lin th to us bo6 D.C. Uthus, D.W. Aha / Artificial Intelligence 199\u00e2\u20ac\u201c200 (2013) 106\u00e2\u20ac\u201c121 cial-network graph (e.g., based on temporal distance, direct relations). Edges representing relationships between two users e weakened over time when they are not interacting. Thus, each graph was a snapshot of the social network at a given int in time. Strzalkowski et al. [87] described beginning work on discovering social phenomena behaviors such as topic control, task ntrol, and leadership. They considered a two-tiered approach, with the higher-level tier consisting of social roles such leadership and group cohesion, which builds upon a mid-level tier consisting of social behaviors such as topic and task ntrol. In their current work, they first used an automated process to measure topic and task control by calculating a set of dices for each. These measurements were then used to compute leadership. They evaluated their approach by surveying e participants in the chat corpus, investigating whether chat users agreed with these social phenomenon assessments. Another area of social phenomenon detection concerns identifying deceptive users. Deceptive users are those who send essages with the aim to create false conclusions [93]. Textual computer-mediated communication hides one factor of ception detection, non-verbal cues, which increases a highly-motivated individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success of deceiving [42].Someinves- ations examined automated techniques for detecting deception in multiparticipant chat; they were motivated to detect ception in chat conversations in the finance industry. Twitchell et al. [93] used speech act profiling to find uncertainty users, which is an indicator of deception. Their approach examines messages sent and creates a profile, which is then amined by a human user to predict if the messenger is being deceptive. Twitchell et al. [92] later used a similar approach, t changed the data used to train the speech act profiler (i.e., the previous study used non-chat data for training, while is approach used chat data). Their results again showed that uncertainty can be used to detect deception, and they also ported new social behavioral results on how deceptive users act in the chat rooms. 8. Automatic summarization Automatic summarization is the process of creating a textual summary from a textual source [41,64,86]. This can be done ing extractive or abstractive methods. Extractive methods use the same text as the original source, which is a shallow alysis, while abstractive methods create new text from the original source, requiring more extensive textual analysis. evaluate summaries, it is common to compare machine-created summaries against a gold standard. One can then use tomated techniques, such as ROUGE [62], or human assessors to compare the two summaries. Automatic summarization of chat messages would be valuable to many types of users given the many uses of chat (see ction 3). For example, it could aid students with studying recorded chat sessions, summarizing meetings, or for reviewing e events that have occurred in a technical chat room, especially if it is of interest to other people. However, summarizing at messages has challenges not seen in other media. For example, Uthus and Aha [94] described how summarizing chat s to overcome thread entanglement, which is not an issue with summarizing dialogues and recorded meetings, and how at lacks metadata that is available for summarizing newsgroups and mailing lists. There are different methods for summarizing chat messages. Zhou and Hovy [107] investigated methods for summariz- g Linux Kernel chat logs using extractive methods to create summaries similar to human-created summaries, which were ed as a gold standard. Their approach initially clustered partial messages under identified topics. From these clusters, then created a collection of summaries, with one summary per topic. They compared their approach against two base- e approaches, and their approach achieved higher precision and F-score measurements when comparing the extracted at messages in their summaries against the extracted messages in the human-created summaries. Uthus and Aha [94] de- ribed initial work on summarizing chat messages from a military perspective. They proposed two forms of summarization: mmarizing a thread of messages and summarizing a group of messages based on temporal distance. Discussion Chat offers many unique challenges due to its informal, conversational nature, and has been a focus of many research eas. AI-related analysis of chat can still be considered in its infancy, as many problems remain open and there is still a t of research needed to address these challenges. In this section, we highlight what we believe are some open issues: rpora creation; boundaries with other media; cross-fertilization of ideas with other forms of microtext and across tasks; d research topics in need of further attention. . Corpora creation There is a strong need for more annotated, publicly-available chat research corpora. Currently, only a few relevant tasets exist. A set of standard corpora could make feasible the comparison of different approaches and provide base- es for research tasks that lack these. For example, topic detection approaches have all been applied to disjoint corpora, us preventing comparative analyses. To overcome this, Bingham et al. [11] applied their techniques to a non-chat corpus obtain labeled data to numerically test their algorithms. An example of a useful corpus is the #LINUX corpus, whose e has fostered comparative evaluations in thread disentanglement. Having similar publicly-assessable corpora would be aon to research in multiparticipant chat analysis. 5. it M tr th de ot 5. pa ar an ch th re od N w 5. re 5. la ti an tr Ya th Ja sh ha to fin w 5. ar co co us to w a de m im phD.C.

Boundaries with other media As we have mentioned throughout this paper, chat has characteristics similar to many other media, but at the same time, has features not found in those media. One understudied issue is the boundaries of chat compared to these other media. ore specifically, when working on a task that has also been studied in other media, such as topic detection, can one apply aditional techniques or are new extensions required? Except for thread disentanglement and chat room feature processing, e tasks described here can easily be abstracted to a similar task on a different medium. Identifying these boundaries could termine when it is worthwhile to consider new features for chat, or if it is acceptable to directly apply techniques from her media to chat. 3. Cross-leveraging techniques As described in Section 2.1, multiparticipant chat analysis shares some commonality with other forms of microtext, rticularly its informal written content. Many techniques for normalizing the written contents in one form of microtext e applicable to other forms of microtext. For example, Bingham et al. [11] were able to apply their algorithm to both chat d newsgroups due to their related characteristics. Investigations into how other microtext techniques could be applied to at could encourage their reuse. Fortunately, new meetings have started to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas, such as e AAAI 2011 Workshop on Analyzing Microtext [4] and the upcoming AAAI 2013 Spring Symposium of the same name. Focusing on chat, there has been little research on cross-leveraging techniques from one research task to achieve better sults on another. For example, despite the increasing amount of research on thread disentanglement, the ideas and meth- s have not be re-used for other tasks such as topic detection, social phenomenon detection, and automatic summarization. ew analyses on how techniques can be cross-leveraged could lead to better solutions to research tasks and help to identify eaknesses in past approaches. 4. Underexplored research foci In addition to the issues we have described in previous sections, there are some challenging problems that have not ceived much research attention on multiparticipant chat analysis. 4.1. Machine translation One unexplored research task is machine translation. There are motivating applications for researching machine trans- tion in chat, such as online games [105], distributed (global) software engineering [16], and international military coali- ons [71]. There has been some work on comparing off-the-shelf software (e.g., Google Translate compared to Apertium [16] d BizLingo [72]), how users can build common ground using machine translation [104], and how to integrate machine anslation into 3D online virtual spaces such as Second Life [105]. To our knowledge, none of these approaches have worked well; many problems arose in the translations. For example, mashita et al. [104] studied users solving a task in a controlled environment, and they found that users could solve e tasks more quickly using English as a common language instead of using their native languages (Chinese, Korean, and panese) translated by the chat client. This was in part from the difficulty of finding a common reference that they could are for the task being solved due to errors in the translations. Additionally, none of these approaches were designed to ndle the unique characteristics of multiparticipant chat. While machine translation algorithms are imperfect, finding ways better incorporate machine translation in chat communications could lead to better translation quality. An example is ding a way to transform chat messages into more formal text, possibly using synonyms or other word features, which ould then be easier to translate. 4.2. Bots \u00e2\u20ac\u201d design and implications Another underexplored area is when artificial agents, such as bots in chat rooms or non-player characters in video games, e participating in chat conversations. There are two areas of concern: designing an agent that can participate in chat nversations, and analyzing chat when some users are not human. Some bots have been designed to communicate with humans in multiparticipant settings, though usually in a one-to-one nversation. For example, Cobot [52] was designed to sit in a virtual chat room in LambdaMOO and interact with other ers. However, from a chat perspective, it could respond to only utterances directed at it, or randomly try to introduce a pic (using external text sources) without regard to what is currently being discussed. A recent paper described initial work ith a virtual chat agent [81]. This agent analyzed utterances using word matching, and then used a template to output message to the chat room with the goal of changing the topic of the chat room. Substantial work would be needed to sign a more intelligent bot that could actively understand and participate in chat rooms with multiple participants. This ay incorporate ideas from other research on multiparticipant chat analysis described in this paper. Most research described in this paper assumed the users were human. However, if the users are not human, this could pact tasks such as topic detection (which is a focus of the two previously mentioned bots), user profiling, and socialenomenon detection. In addition, should bots become more intelligent, this could lead to new research areas of trying 11 to m w ce th 5. to As an to ro op us th 6. va te th ci de av ch ch im Ac Ut op or Re [ [ [ [8 D.C.

They examined passive (e.g., com- unication pattern analysis) and active (e.g., human interrogation strategies) methods for detecting malicious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chatbots\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, hich they applied to transcripts of one-to-one conversations competing in Turing tests. Their passive methods were suc- ssful in identifying chatbots in the small set of chat data they examined, though they recommend further research as eir approaches would fail as chatbots become more intelligent. 4.3. Intelligent user interfaces The final research foci we discuss concerns intelligent user interfaces. We have already described some research on this pic (see Section 3.1). Additional studies have been conducted in the military context. For example, the Tactical Situation sessment Technologies (TSAT) project [40,68,69] created a client that permits the user to communicate without a keyboard d use icons to represent words. The authors describe needed advancements in chat analysis to discover topics likely reoccur and to analyze large databases of chat text. Also, Boiney et al. [12] introduced an approach for military chat om management using visual cues to identify when a chat room becomes more active. They address a common problem: erators may have many concurrently open chat rooms, but can focus on only a few at a time. New research on intelligence er interfaces could lead to clients that incorporate many of the techniques described in this survey, such as those for read disentanglement and topic detection, making chat easier to use and follow. Conclusion We have surveyed several tasks concerning multiparticipant chat analysis and we reviewed areas of research that moti- ted these tasks. Chat is a difficult medium to analyze due to its unique characteristics. This has caused many traditional xt analysis techniques to perform poorly when applied, leading to new areas of research for chat. Among the many tasks at have been explored are chat preprocessing, chat room feature processing, thread disentanglement, topic detection, so- al phenomenon detection, user profiling, message attribute identification, and automatic summarization. We have also scribed open areas and challenging problems in chat. To conclude, there is a lack of widely-deployed techniques for automated analysis of multiparticipant chat, which if ailable could aid a large variety of users and data analysts. Despite the rise of other forms of social communication, at is still a predominant form of communications in many research and application environments. Thus, multiparticipant at analysis is an exciting research topic in AI with many research problems whose solutions could have substantial social pact. knowledgements Thanks to NRL for funding this research and to Jeffrey Ellen and Micha Elsner for their feedback on this paper.

We survey research on the analysis of multiparticipant chat. Multiple research and applied communities (e.g., AI, educational, law enforcement, military) have interest in this topic. After introducing some context, we describe relevant problems and how these have been addressed using AI techniques. We also identify recent research trends and unresolved issues that could benefit from more attention.

In this study, they were used as alternative tools to estimate the characteristics of hydraulic jumps, such as the free surface location and energy dissipation. The dimensionless hydraulic parameters, including jump depth, jump length, and energy dissipation, were determined as functions of the Froude number and the height and length of corrugations. The estimations of the ANN and GP models were found to be in good agreement with the measured data. The results of the ANN model were compared with those of the GP model, showing that the proposed ANN models are much more accurate than the GP models. Key words: artificial neural networks; genetic programming; corrugated bed; Froude number; hydraulic jump 1 Introduction The transition of a supercritical open channel flow into a subcritical flow is associated with the formation of a hydraulic jump. Hydraulic jumps have been extensively studied because of their frequent occurrence in nature and their use as energy dissipators in outlet works of hydraulic structures (Hager 1992). The classical equation for estimating the relationship between the ratio of the downstream * flow depth to the upstream flow depth, yy 1 , and the upstream Froude number 2 Fr1 =u1 gy 1 (where u1 is the mean velocity at the beginning of the jump and g is the acceleration due to gravity) originates from the momentum equation. Applying the momentum equation to the control volume bounded by the upstream and downstream cross-sections of the jump, the subcritical sequent depth y2* is obtained from Eq. (1) (Vischer and Hager 1995): y2* = 1 ( 1+ 8Fr 2 -1) (1) y12 1 A complete description of a hydraulic jump also involves its length Lj , which is the distance between the two cross-sections with the sequent depth y2 and upstream supercritical depth y1 . From the practical point of view, the jump length is an important variable to define the downstream limit beyond which no bed protection is necessary. The jump length is hard to \u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc *Corresponding author (e-mail: akabbaspour@yahoo.com) Received Jul. 19, 2012; accepted Feb. 27, 2013 define in actual experiments, mainly because the end cross-section of the hydraulic jump is difficult to locate due to surface waves and residual turbulence (Hager 1992). Preliminary investigations by Hager (1992), Hughes and Flack (1984), Mohamed Ali (1991), Negm (2002), and Carollo et al. (2007) indicate that if the bed of the channel on which the jump is formed is rough, the sequent depth y2could be significantly lower than the corresponding subcritical sequent depth y2* . Ead and Rajaratnam (2002) installed corrugated sheets on the bed in such a way that the crests of sinusoidal corrugations were at the same level as the upstream bed on which the supercritical flow was produced by a sluice gate. The roughness height was assumed equal to the corrugation height. Tokyay (2005) experimentally investigated the effects of channel bed corrugations on hydraulic jumps. In his experiment, wave steepness values of 0.20 and 0.26 were used, and the Froude number values range from was 5 to 12. Abbaspour et al. (2009) studied the effects of a sinusoidal corrugated bed on the characteristic parameters of a hydraulic jump within a wide range of wave steepness values. The sequent depth ratio yy 1, the jump length, the energy dissipation, and the bed shear 2 stress of the jump were determined as functions of the Froude number, and the results were compared with the data obtained from a smooth channel bed. Because of the complexity of hydraulic jumps, more practical tools are required to model hydraulic jump processes. Regressions have been most commonly used to estimate jump characteristics. However, regression analysis may have large uncertainties, and the computed jump depth and length can be far from the actual ones. Also, the regression analysis has some limitations caused by predefined equations for modeling. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic programming (GP) have been used to model hydraulic jump processes. They have been used to estimate the scouring around piles by Kambekar and Deo (2003) and the scouring below spillways by Azmathullah et al. (2008). Also, a combination of the fuzzy inference system (FIS) with ANNs, ANFIS, has been employed to estimate the wave characteristics by Mahjoobi et al. (2008). GP and ANNs have been successfully applied in maritime engineering (Kalra and Deo 2007; Singh et al. 2007; Gaur and Deo 2008). The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of hydraulic jumps in a horizontal flume with a corrugated bed using the ANN and GP methods. These soft computing tools can evaluate the relative importance of input parameters, such as the relative roughness, the corrugation wavelength, and the Froude number, on the jump process. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Experimental setup The experimental setup consisted of a main flume in a discharge collection channel. The main flume was 0.25 m wide and 0.50 m deep, and had a bed slope of 0.002. A triangular weir was placed at the end of the channel to measure the discharge. A supercritical approach flow was produced using a sluice gate. A corrugated polyethylene sheet with sinusoidal corrugations of wavelength s and height t was installed perpendicular to the flow direction in the flume so that the corrugation crests were at the level of the upstream bed carrying the supercritical flow. The flow channel section of the experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1 (Abbaspour et al. 2009). A total of 123 experimental groups were conducted. Ranges of the variables in the experiment are shown in Table 1. Hydraulic jumps on the corrugated bed were produced for different Froude numbers, and the hydraulic parameters were measured. The water surface profiles of the jumps on the corrugated bed were measured at the centerline of the flume with a point gauge with an accuracy of 0.1 mm. The supercritical depth y1and sequent depth y2of the jumps were continuously measured using ultra sonic sensors, and the data was saved on a computer and processed with the VisiDAQ software. The length of the jump, Lj , in the experiment was recorded. The values of the Reynolds number in this experiment were in the range of 61200 to 175600. Fig. 1 Sketch of free jump on corrugated bed in experiment (Abbaspour et al. 2009) Table 1 Ranges of field data in experiment Using the Buckingham . theorem, non-dimensional equations in functional forms can be obtained. The following functional relationships have been worked out in the present study, as shown in Eqs. (2) through (4), where yy , Ly , and EE 1are, respectively, the 2 1j 1L sequent depth ratio, length ratio, and energy dissipation in a hydraulic jump: y2 \u00a7 ts\u00b7 = fFr, , (2) 1 \u00a8 1 \u00b8 y yy 1 \u00a9 11 \u00b9 Lj \u00a7 ts\u00b7 = fFr, , (3) 2 \u00a8 1 \u00b8 y yy 1 \u00a9 11 \u00b9 E EE ts\u00b7 - \u00a7 L 21 == fFr,, (4) 3 \u00a8 1 \u00b8 EE yy 11 \u00a9 11 \u00b9 where ELis the difference between the specific energy before and after the jump, and E EE- . = L 21 2.2 Artificial neural network (ANN) An artificial neural network (ANN) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems, such as the brain, process information. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurons) working in unison to solve specific problems. Neurons are arranged in layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. There is no specific rule that dictates the number of hidden layers. The function is established largely based on the connections between the elements of the network. In the input layer, each neuron is designated for one of the input parameters. The network learns by applying the back-propagation algorithm, which compares the neural network simulated values with the actual values and calculates the estimation errors. The data set in the network is divided into a learning data set, which is used to train the network, and a validation data set, which is used to test the network performance. In the present study, the neural network fitting tool (nftool) of MATLAB 7.5 was used. After training the network, verification is conducted until the success of the training can be established. In the simulation of hydraulic jumps, characteristic data were investigated with the neural network using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is an approximation of Newton\u2019s method. In order to check the sensitivity of the neural networks, a simulation study was carried out with hidden nodes of different numbers, 5, 10, 15, and 20. The parameters considered in the study are the dimensionless jump depth 2 yy 1, dimensionless jump length j Ly 1, L and dimensionless energy dissipation EE 1. The dimensionless parameters, s y1, ty 1 , and Fr1, were used as inputs to the ANN model to estimate the hydraulic jump characteristics. One hundred and twenty-three experimental data sets were used for the ANN simulations. They were divided into three parts, 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The correlation coefficient (R), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) statistics were used to evaluate the model accuracy. R shows the degree to which two variables were linearly related. Different types of information about the predictive capabilities of the model are measured through RMSE and MAE. An efficiency of 1 (NSE = 1) corresponds to a perfect match of the modeled values to the observed data. \u00a6 n ( X - X )(Y - Y ) ii i=1 R = (5) \u00a6 n ( Xi - X )2 \u00a6n (Yi - Y )2 i=1 i=1 \u00a6n ( Xi - Yi )2 i =1 RMSE = (6) n \u00a6n ( Xi - Yi ) i=1 MAE = n (7) \u00a6 n (Xi -Yi )2 i=1 NSE =-1 n (8) \u00a6(Xi -X )2 i=1 where X is the observed values, X is the mean of X , Y is the estimated values, Y is i ii the mean of Yi, and n is the number of data sets. From the simulation study that was carried out on different numbers of hidden nodes, it was found that good estimation accuracy was achieved with 15 neurons in the hidden layer in -x four trials. The sigmoid, fx()= (+e ), and linear activation functions were used for the hidden and output nodes, respectively. 2.3 Genetic programming (GP) In artificial intelligence, genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user-defined task. GP initializes a population consisting of random members known as chromosomes, and the \u00bftness of each chromosome is evaluated with respect to a target value. The principle of Darwinian natural selection is used to select and reproduce \u00bftter programs. GP creates computer programs that consist of variables and several mathematical function sets as the solution. The function set of a system can be composed of arithmetic operations (+, \u00ed, \u00d7, \u00f7), function calls (such as ex , x, sqrt, and power), even relational operators (>, <, =) or conditional operators, and a terminal set with variables and constants ( x ,,\" x ). An initial population is x , 12n randomly created with a number of individuals formed by nodes (operators, variables, and constants) and previously defined according to the problem domain. An objective function must be defined to evaluate the fitness of each individual. Selection, crossover, and mutation operators are then applied to the best individuals and a new population is created. The whole process is repeated until the given generation number is reached (Koza 1992). The fitness of a GP individual may be computed using Eq. (9): n f =\u00a6 X -Y (9) jj j=1 where Xj is the value returned by a chromosome for the fitness case j, and Yj is the expected value for the fitness case j. In the GP model many operators, like sin, cos, and log, and mathematical functions were used, and it was found that the functions of the proposed GP model were complex. Also, the GP model using more operators has larger estimated difference. In this study, for simplicity, only four arithmetic operators (+, \u00ed, \u00d7, \u00f7) were used. The functional and operational parameter settings used in the GP model are shown in Table 2. The performance of the GP model in training and testing sets was validated in terms of the common statistical measures R, RMSE, MAE, and NSE. Table 2 Parameters of GP Model Parameter Parameter description Setting of parameters 1P Function set +, \u00ed, \u00d7, \u00f7 2P Generation number 5 000 3P Mutation frequency (%) 50 4P Number of chromosomes 30 5P Number of generations 3 6P Linking function Multiplication 3 Results and discussion In order to investigate the hydraulic jumps on the corrugated bed, the characteristics, such as water surface profile, jump length, and bed energy dissipation, were evaluated. During model developments in this study, the dimensionless jump depth, jump length, and energy dissipation ( yy , Ly , and EE 1) were selected as outputs and three dimensionless 1L2 1j parameters Frt 1, y1 , and s y1 as inputs. 3.1 Hydraulic jump estimation using ANN model Different ANN structures were tried in terms of hidden layer node numbers. In this study, the number of neurons in the hidden layer was obtained using the trial and error method. From the simulation study, which was carried out using the ANN model, it was found that with 15 neurons in the hidden layer, the estimation accuracy increased to some extent. For the better understanding of the model performance, plots of yy , Ly 1, and 2 1j EE 1simulations taken from the training, validation, and testing data sets are given in L Figs. 2, 3, and 4. In general, an R value greater than 0.9 and a NSE value greater than 0.7 indicate a very satisfactory model performance. The comparison between the estimated values of yy , Ly , and EE 1with measured data (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) shows that an excellent 2 1j 1L estimation using the ANN model can be observed. Fig. 2 Comparison of measured and estimated yy 1 values using ANN model for 2 training, validation, and testing data Fig. 3 Comparison of measured and estimated Lj y values using ANN model for 1 training, validation, and testing data Fig. 4 Comparison of measured and estimated EL E1 values using ANN model for training, validation, and testing data 3.2 Hydraulic jump estimation using GP model Figs. 5, 6, and 7 show the estimated results of yy , Ly , and EE 1for the training 2 1L1j and testing data. An almost perfect agreement of the measured values with the GP estimations is clearly seen. For the GP model, referring to Figs. 5, 6, and 7, the GP model has good ability in estimating yy and EE 1, as reflected in low values of RMSEand MAE and a high 2 1L value of R. The superior performance of the GP model, compared with other methods, is attributed to the powerful artificial intelligence techniques for computer learning inspired by natural evolution to find an appropriate mathematical model to fit a set of points. GP employs a population of functional expressions and also numerical constants, based on how closely they fit to the corresponding data (Koza 1992). The simplified analytical forms of the proposed GP model for yy , Ly 1, and 2 1j EE 1may be, respectively, expressed as shown in Eqs. (10) through (12).

It can be seen from the fit line equations (the equations are assumed to be y = ax + b) in the scatter plots of the GP model that the coefficients a and b for the ANN model, with a higher R value, are, respectively, closer to 1 and 0 than the GP model. This can be clearly observed from its fit line equation coefficients. Table 4 compares the ANN and GP models, with all statistical measures, R, RMSE, NSE, and MAE, of the training and testing data. According to Table 4, the ANN model has lower absolute error as compared with the GP model, showing that the proposed ANN models are much more accurate than the GP models for water engineering. Table 4 RMSE, MAE, R, and NSE statistics of training and testing data of ANN and GP models 4 Conclusions In general, the performance of the ANN and GP models are superior to the statistical regression schemes. The ANN and GP models were developed to determine the hydraulic jump on a corrugated bed. The input parameters used for the ANN and GP simulations are the dimensionless wavelength ( s y1 ), the dimensionless height ( ty 1 ), and the upstream Froude number ( Fr1 ). These models can be successfully used in the computation of hydraulic jump characteristics. The optimum ANN model was obtained after different structures were tried in terms of hidden layer node numbers. The estimations of the ANN model were compared with those of the GP model. According to Table 4, the model performance can be evaluated as satisfactory if NSE > 0.7 and R > 0.9 with low values of RMSE and MAE. The proposed ANN models are much more accurate than the GP models. The GP models are much more practical than the ANN models because they provide nonlinear mathematical equations. This study used limited field data from available literature and further work using more data from various areas may be required to provide additional support for these conclusions.

The sensory inputs are interpreted as morphogen-levels by the genome, what results in the production of proteins, that influence the actuators (e.g., the motors if the genome steers a single robotic unit, the \u2018docking signals\u2019 if the genome controls the building process of the organism). In contrast to the basic VE system (described in [70] only the VE-genome is used to steer the individual robot. The other components (e.g., the diffusion process of morphogens with the organism) are of course used during the building process of the robotic organism (not shown in this figure for depicting reasons). Fig. 10 3D-Screenshot of the adapted VE simulation environment. All simulated robots have the same genome, determining both: the behavior of the moving robotic modules and of the modules within the robotic organism. This way the genome controls the behavior as well the behavior of the robotic swarm, as well as the building process of the robotic organism. Blue boxes indicate robotic organism modules (immobile), green areas indicate \u2018docking signals\u2019, brown boxes indicate \u2018movers\u2019, brown lines indicate trajectories of \u2018movers\u2019 (only shown for depicting reasons).

To build this shape less robots are required, but the building process is more complex. During the evolutionary process, a given genome was rewarded with fitness-points for every patch of the developed robotic organism covering the given shape (and of course punished for covering patches not part of the given shape).

Tel.: +43 316 380 8759. Swarm systems are based on intermediate connectivity between individuals and dynamic neighborhoods. In natural swarms self-organizing principles bring their agents to that favorable level of connectivity. They serve as interesting sources of inspiration for control algorithms in swarm robotics on the one hand, and in modular robotics on the other hand. In this paper we demonstrate and compare a set of bio-inspired algorithms that are used to control the collective behavior of swarms and modular systems: BEECLUST, AHHS (hormone controllers), FGRN (fractal genetic regulatory networks), and VE (virtual embryogenesis). We demonstrate how such bio-inspired control paradigms bring their host systems to a level of intermediate connectivity, what delivers sufficient robustness to these systems for collective decentralized control. In parallel, these algorithms allow sufficient volatility of shared information within these systems to help preventing local optima and deadlock situations, this way keeping those systems flexible and adaptive in dynamic non-deterministic environments. 1 Introduction In collective adaptive systems, the degree of coupling between group members do strongly vary in nature and the artificial world. This range starts with systems showing a low degree of coupling among individuals, which is the case, for example, whenever individuals in a group move randomly and independent from other group members [36]. Examples of such systems are gases or robots programmed to do only collision avoidance. Given that in natural systems communication and interaction is usually local, there is a high volatility in the amount of information that can be exchanged by explicit communication and other interactions. A higher degree of coupling can be observed in systems in which coordinated movements like flocks are performed [47]. In such systems partners stay in local neighborhood for a longer period of time thus communication allows these local partners to adapt their behavior (and maybe also their inner state) to each other. Thus, such coordinated motion patterns can be seen as a median degree of coupling. On the other extreme, there are also very rigidly coupled systems where members of the group stay together for a long time and communication/interaction is restricted to local neighbors [70]. Examples for such systems are crystals, solid bodies or cells of an organism, which are strongly physically coupled. This distinction made above, also holds for collectives of artificial agents, virtual or embodied in robots, which can be arranged in different levels of coupling. Their movement can be random, coordinated as in a flock, or, in the case of modular/cellular robotics, the motion of the robotic subunits can be tightly connected. In this article we divide collective systems in three separated levels of coupling (Fig. 1 ). These levels are described in the following and the pros and cons of the degree of coupling are depicted. 1.1 Dynamic random coupling If movement is purely randomized there is a problem with volatility of information that gets lost within this class of systems and random motion introduces unfavorable amounts of noise into the collective information processing. In consequence, we claim that a swarm of agents that exhibits mainly random motion has to perform a behavior (a swarm algorithm) which compensates for this low degree of coupling. One well-known example to compensate for such easy losses of information is \u2018stigmergy\u2019 [22] where information is dropped in the environment and stays stable for an amount of time even though many different agents pass through this limited area frequently. Stigmergy is often found in (eu-) social animals like ants [4], honeybees [14,13], termites [22], wasps [35] and cockroaches [1]. Besides these natural examples, the algorithmic concept of stigmergy was used in mathematical optimization [19] and also in coordination of robotic swarms [5]. However, also in stigmergic systems, information has to pass away over time. In robotics, such an approach has been used in several variants. Virtual pheromones projected from the top of the robotic arena [62,21], \u2018virtual pheromones\u2019 exchanged by direct robot-to-robot communication [44,45], \u2018virtual pheromone trail\u2019 left by agents in the environment, for example by excitation of glow paint [10,39] and \u2018virtual nectar\u2019 exchanged by robots in the trophallaxis-algorithm [49], which was inspired by the frequent exchange of liquid food in honeybee workers [16,17]. In this article we discuss aggregation-based robotic mechanisms like the BEECLUST algorithm [56,36] as one exemplary case how random motion has to \u2018crystallize\u2019 under specific local circumstances to allow collective computation and/or collective decision making. 1.2 Dynamic correlated coupling Systems we categorize into this level have a desired ratio of randomness to constancy that allows for a high degree of adaptivity and flexibility. Neighboring relations are dynamic but not uncorrelated as in random motion. Acquired knowledge about neighbors are valid for long time intervals compared to the frequency of necessary actions. In addition, such behaviors are self-sustaining. For example, in collective motion the knowledge about the distance to the next neighbor has value because this neighbor will stay a neighbor for a relevant period of time and additionally this information helps in coordinating motion which even increases the persistence of neighborhood relations. 1.3 Static coupling This class refers to all physically coupled systems that consist of modules which are \u2018docked\u2019 to each other. Such systems are not confronted with the problem of random motion inducing noise because the modules stay together for a long time. The problem here is the lack of flexibility which comes to light in multiple issues. A simple scenario in which this problem arises is a shape, which is not suited for the given task. Thus, a physically coupled system might be too rigid and possibly lacks flexibility. Examples for systems with static couplings are natural organisms [41], cellular robotics [6] or modular robotics [40,58,26]. The latter example deals with a bio-inspired approach for modular robotic systems which focuses on getting rid of the strong rigidity of classical robotics. Also the algorithms executed on autonomous cells/modules have to overcome the rigidity that is imposed by the physical coupling and have to introduce some long-distance interaction between modules which are not directly connected neighbors. Several approaches have been performed in this domain, ranging from central pattern generators (CPGs) [32,31] to hormone-inspired control paradigms [58,52,24]. In this article, we discuss several of these static coupling approaches, how they allow collective computation and globally dynamic patterns of growth and of collective motion. The different levels of coupling (dynamic random coupling, dynamic correlated coupling, and static coupling) influence issues like energy and information inside a collective (Fig. 1). If there is a strong coupling which comes with stable spatial relationship a certainty of information transfer is given. Also the number of direct neighbors is stable and thus a constant in the environment of an individual. On the other side of the spectrum of coupling strength in a collective system there is the problem of too much flexibility. As denoted by arrows in Fig. 1, there is no strict separation between the three levels of coupling but rather smooth transitions. In the following sections we will present approaches and algorithms including their application experiments to swarm systems which reduce the drawbacks of being in dynamic random coupling mode or in static coupling mode. The paper is structured in reference to Fig. 1. The next section deals with an algorithm called BEECLUST which brings the system from the left-hand side to the middle of Fig. 1. Section 3 introduces two algorithms (Sections 3.1 (AHHS) and 3.2 (FGRN)) which perform in systems with static couplings with the aim of pushing the system to more flexibility. Additionally, in Section 4 we will exploit a novel approach which acts on all coupling-levels simultaneously, Virtual Embryogenesis (VE), and investigate the evolvability of the different coupling-levels. The VE approach mimics biological processes of growth based on concepts reaching from early works on decentral, self-organized groups of agents [71] to models of growth processes of embryos and their interactions with evolutionary processes (EvoDevo) [43,42]. Also the combined body-controller evolution described in [59,57,34] is within focus of the VE approach. We will conclude the paper with a summary of the algorithms described and a critical discussion on what is still missing to completely understand the impact of the degree of coupling in swarms. 2 Algorithms for systems with dynamic random coupling Systems that are based on random motion, such as loosely coupled members in swarms, are characterized by the high degree of information volatility as mentioned above. Therefore, the accessibility and reliability of information has to be increased in order to generate any form of coordinated behavior in such a system. Two types of information occur: information that is associated with spatial features (e.g., landmarks, light conditions, temperature) and information that is defined by relations between agents (e.g., team mates, couples of sender and receiver, neighbors). When relations between agents change fast and persistently, it is better to rely on spatial features. As discussed above, that is the swarm\u2019s option of applying the stigmergy approach. A second option is to overcome the high dynamics in agent-agent relations. That is achieved by making sure that neighboring agents are likely to stay within their mutual neighborhoods. The analog to that behavior from physics would be the cooling process of a gas or fluid which is the reduction of particle speeds according to kinetic theory and consequently an extension of neighboring relations in time. Here we discuss the example of BEECLUST, which is an algorithm for cue-based swarm aggregation and achieves coordinated motion by implementing the second option (slowing down the neighborhood changes). However, it applies also the first option (leveraging spatial features) to a certain extend. 2.1 BEECLUST The BEECLUST algorithm (see Fig. 2 ) is based on observations of young honeybees [64], was analyzed in many models [30,51,55,25,23,2], and was even implemented in a swarm of robots [56]. This algorithm allows a swarm to aggregate based on cues (e.g., temperature, light, sound) although individual agents do not perform a greedy gradient ascent. In addition, a BEECLUST-controlled swarm is able to break symmetries [25]. Say the agents are initially randomly distributed in space with initially randomly distributed headings. Then this swarm would be fully uncoordinated and an assumed graph representing the agents by its nodes and the agents\u2019 neighboring relations by edges would show high dynamics in its adjacency matrix. However, once two agents approach each other close enough to allow for mutual perception then they will stop. Staying stopped means they conserve their neighborhood relation. The mutual perception can be viewed as a cue-based process under the assumption that perceiving another agent is the perception of a cue. An additional cue, the spatial feature of this considered spot (e.g., temperature), is leveraged because the waiting time is proportional to the measurement of this local feature. Other agents might run into these two robots by chance forming a cluster of aggregated agents. Once the cluster has reached a certain size (defined by the number of stopped agents) there is a break-even between the expected number of incoming agents and the expected number of outgoing agents. Then the cluster is permanently expanding assuming a constant density of agents in the surroundings. The change in neighborhoods within such a cluster is obviously little because agents that are fully surrounded by other agents cannot escape. Hence, a BEECLUST-controlled swarm self-organizes a cooling process in its neighborhood relations which allows for high accessibility and reliability of neighbor-based information. This information is, in turn, used as a cue in the aggregation process itself. The graphs in Fig. 3 document the decreasing volatility of the neighborhood relations over time. 1 Video online: http://youtu.be/955wCc1f2Ug. 1 The edges shown in Fig. 3 were obtained by triangulation and were introduced to visualize the cooling process. These edges are virtual while the algorithm actually relies on neighborhoods defined by the agents\u2019 sensor range which is here less than 2% of the arena side length. Moving agents have fast changing neighborhoods and clustered agents have static neighborhoods except for agents passing at less than the sensor range. As the number of clustered agents increases the degree of connectivity increases and the volatility of neighborhood relations decreases. Hence, the BEECLUST-controlled swarm starts in a state that is to be placed in the left third of Fig. 1 and moves toward the right hand side. 3 Algorithms for systems with static couplings The strongest degree of coupling in a swarm is reached by physically connected group members in a modular system (cf. Fig. 1, right). Problems that arise concerning information and energy transfer between the modules, here, are that it is too robust and tight. E.g., no inner localization can be performed because there are no differences between the single modules inside. Important features for the behavior of the natural or artificial organism like symmetry breaking cannot be establish. Another prominent problem is being not flexible concerning configurations depending on the task. The field of modular reconfigurable robotics tries to keep the balance between the flexibility of the shape and reliability of information transfer. 3.1 Artificial homeostatic hormone system (AHHS) In this section we describe an algorithm based on reaction\u2013diffusion systems which is able to build a gradient with which, e.g., the self-localization inside the organism can be established. It is able to perform shape\u2013independently in a reconfigurable robot system. Thus, we do not claim that this algorithm is able to bring a system being on the right of Fig. 1 toward the left hand side by itself but it is able to cope with modular reconfigurable systems which get a rigid system more flexible on their own. The original idea of the algorithm presented here was introduced by Schmickl and Crailsheim [50] and in more detail by Schmickl et al. [52]. It is called artificial homeostatic hormone system (AHHS). For an application of AHHS as a controller performing on robot hardware see [60,54]. Schmickl et al. [53] report perspectives of the AHHS approach. An improved version of the AHHS is reported in [24,28], which is applied in this work. An application of this approach to modular robotics is reported in [27]. An AHHS is the implementation of a dynamical system consisting of several state variables (artificial hormones) and a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) that govern their dynamics. The key feature of AHHS is how the parameters of these ODE are encoded and determined. Concentrations of the artificial hormones are allowed to increase independently but are subject to a certain decay as well, which decreases the hormone concentration independently. Rules manipulate hormone concentrations and influence the hormone dynamics based on sensory input and based on the concentrations of other hormones. The actuators are controlled by rules that translate hormone concentrations to actuator control values. Here, AHHSs are used as control devices on the modules of a modular robotic organism which implements a statical coupled system. The hormones diffuse between connected modules. This influence of the hormone concentrations in neighboring modules makes the spatial topology of the modular robotic system relevant for the functionality of the AHHSs in the organism. The topology could be a virtual compartment structure within the module in allusion to compartmentalizations in biological cells [65] or an aggregate of several modules, as it the case here. We implemented homogeneous parametrized AHHSs on each module of a virtual modular robotic organism. The organism consists of seven modules. In the experiments described here only one compartment per module is implemented. Diffusion implies an implicit communication between the modules. The functionality of the controller in each module is altered by the diffusion process which is in turn influenced by the topology of the organism. Here, we used shapes of T, X, H and I as four different topologies. As inputs, we used four different functions in the experiment. These functions defined the sensor input of the first module that we call head module. We distinguished no input, squared-pulse, linear-increase and sinus input. These input functions are derived from experiments with autonomous, mobile robot systems where the input is a distance sensor pointing to the front of the organisms. In this case, having no input means the situation when the organism is going straight without being confronted with an obstacle. An input of a squared-pulse function is given when the organism moves sideways and thereby it is moving past an obstacle. The linear-increase input arises when the organism moves towards an obstacle. The sinus input happens with a caterpillar-like movement when the distance of the head facing the ground varies over time. For the experiments AHHS is initialized 30 times with random parametrization. Two hormones and 30 rules are used. The hormone concentration is altered by random initialized decay and base production rates and by the sensor input. This sensor input is only presented at the first module, but the information can be transported by diffusion through all seven modules as explained above. To analyze the performance of the AHHS when applied in different robotic body shapes we conducted 480 runs. All four input functions were applied to each of the four shapes with 30 random parametrized AHHSs. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the dynamics of values and concentrations for one shape in each column. The upper row presents the sensor value (S0) which was applied to the head module (mod0). The two middle rows present the concentrations of hormone zero (H0) in head module (mod0) and in the tail module (mod6). The bottom row are the actuator values taken from the last module. The course of the dynamics are shown for 3000 steps in these four exemplary runs. Each with one of the shapes, schematically presented above the dynamics, and one of the input functions (for all 480 runs see Supplemental material A). The first column of Fig. 4 presents one run with the AHHS implemented in a robot organism with a T shape and no input is given. The intrinsic behavior of the presented AHHS leads to a chaotic behavior of the concentration of H0 independent of the position in the robotic organism (Fig. 4, first column, 2nd and 3rd graph). The equality of the course of the hormone concentrations over time in the head and tail module originate from the identical situation in these two modules: diffusion to one neighbor and no input. The chaotic behavior of H0 leads also to a chaotic behavior of the actuator value (cf., Fig. 4, first column, last graph). An X shaped organism being confronted with a squared-pulsed input signal is shown in Fig. 4, second column. In this AHHS a two-point equilibrium is established by the hormone concentration and actuator value. The value of the equilibria is altered due to the squared pulses. The information of the sensor in the head module is transported to the actuator value in tail module. The example chosen with an H shaped organism is with a linear input function (Fig. 4, third column). In the head module the input is transformed to a maximum function. At the other end of the organism \u2013 in the tail module \u2013 the information of the sensor value is reduced to a step function of the H0 concentration. This function is mapped on the actuator value. Similar transformation of information is taking place when observing the example with a snake-like (I) topology of the robot organism and a sinus input function (Fig. 4, last column). The dynamic of the sinusoidal input is still expressed by the hormone concentration in the head module, but lost until it reaches the tail module. Even with the AHHS being randomly parameterized first favorable information processing tasks can be observed in the results of these experiments (i.e., mapping a maximum function to a step function). With the possibility of using optimization techniques for tweaking the parameters it becomes clear that AHHS is a valuable tool for performing on a statically coupled robotic organism with reconfiguration abilities. After the presentation and investigation of the first approach for modular systems in static coupling (right third in Fig. 1) an alternative approach for this coupling level is presented in the following. 3.2 Fractal gene regulatory network (FGRN) In this section another algorithm for controlling a statically coupled robotic system is presented. This is the implementation of fractal gene regulatory network (FGRN) which is represented as a motion controller of an I shaped (snake-like) modular robot in a physics-based simulator. In contrast to AHHS, which was used in the previous section, diffusion is not implemented in this system and there is no explicit communication between the modules. However, the system has to deal with the fact of no initial difference between the modules and also needs a mechanism of distance-interaction between the modules. In order to meet these requirements, local sensors are used on every module. By using the local sensors, an implicit communication is achieved through environmental feedback. FGRN which is introduced in Bentley [9] is a variant of computational gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (such as [48,3,20,11]. FGRN is inspired by biological cells [38]. It has been investigated for robustness and efficiency in Bentley [8] and successfully implemented as a single controller unit for different tasks such as controlling conventional robots [7], producing patterns [9], motion planning [76], and pole-balancing [37]. It has also been implemented as distributed controllers of modular robots [75,74,77]. An FGRN system can be implemented as several units that run independent from each other but all contain an identical encoding. The units are capable of interacting with their local environment. Other units can also be considered as a part of the environment and the behavior of an FGRN unit can be implicitly influenced by the behavior of its neighbors. An FGRN unit consists of encoding substances \u2013 called genes \u2013 and interaction substances \u2013 called \u2018fractal proteins\u2019. Genes belong to different types and make proteins with various functionalities. A schematic representation of the interactions inside an FGRN unit is summarized in Fig. 6 (see [9] for a detailed description). A fractal protein consists of two parts: shape and concentration level. Shapes are encoded in the genes by three real values (x, y, z) which represent the center and size of a window on a fractal set (see Fig. 5 ). Concentration levels represent the current amount of proteins as real values. At every time-step, shapes of the existing fractal proteins define a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) that indicate the current dynamics of the system. The concentration levels perform as the state-variables. Any change in a protein concentration level that leads to a decrease to zero or raise from zero means that the protein is deleted or added to the system in the current time-step which in turn leads to a different ODE system for the next time-step. In order to use an FGRN system as controllers of a modular robot, every module contains an FGRN unit. All the units contain an identical copy of the genes but run independently from each other. In every step during runtime of each module, an interaction cycle is executed. Input values provided by local sensors of the modules are normalized and specify the concentration levels of input proteins, the output values are generated by the units and are scaled into appropriate range to be used as control signals of the actuators of the modules. In the current experiment, FGRNs are generated as controllers of a modular robot with snake morphology consisting of three homogeneous modules. The task is to locomote the snake as fast as possible. Every module uses an actuator which is a central hinge and contains an FGRN unit as its local controller. There is no explicit communication between the modules and consequently between the FGRN units. But every module contains proximity sensors in their front and rear faces. Since the modules are tightly coupled in a modular robot, behavior of a module can influence the inputs received by the proximity sensors of the neighboring modules and the evolved behavior of the whole system relies on this coupling (Fig. 7 shows a sketch and a screenshot of the moving robot). The experiment is performed in Symbricator3D [73]. Symbricator3D is a simulator designed for the projects [63,46] and uses the design of the prototype described in [29]. It is based on the game engine Delta-3D and uses the Open Dynamics Engine for the simulation of dynamics. A variant of a Genetic Algorithms (see [9] for details) is used to optimize a population of 30 randomly generated FGRNs as distributed controller for the robot. In order to have a look in the internal dynamics, an arbitrary controller is chosen and the dynamics of the concentration levels of proteins inside the three modules and their generated output values are presented in Fig. 8 . The internal dynamics of each module is based on the two input proteins, and the regulatory protein. Note that all the modules contain identical FGRN genome and any variation in the dynamics and behavior of the FGRN units initiates from different inputs received from the sensors. As represented in Fig. 8, in the front and middle modules regulatory protein level stays at zero permanently, therefore the output is solely produced based on the input values. In the rear module, the regulatory protein is produced frequently whenever the input from the rear sensor gets a large value which is the case in the beginning of the process. When the regulatory protein gets a positive value, the output stays static with a small positive value and it is not influenced by any of the input values. When the regulatory protein vanishes, the output only reacts to the inputs. The input value of \u2018covered\u2019 proximity sensors (rear sensor of the front module, both sensors of the middle module and front sensor of the rear module) is small due to the placing of the sensors. By moving a hinge of a module, the distances which are sensed by the sensors of the neighboring modules change by a small value. Even though these changes are small they still may have an influence on the generated output. This way the behavior of each module may influence the behavior of the others. The two approaches (AHHS and FGRN) presented in this section, provide means of localization and distance-communication in order to help the modules to identify their role in relation to the whole organism and compensate for the lack of flexibility of possible interactions between modules in a statically coupled configuration. Next we consider how to control the transitions from dynamic random coupling to dynamic correlated coupling and to static coupling. 4 Algorithms for systems to control of transitions between coupling levels In some applications both extremes mentioned in Section 1 exist in parallel: mobile agents move around randomly, and under given conditions, aggregate to a static linked system. One example of such a switch between the extremes is the self-organized building process of a statically coupled multi-robotic systems out of individual mobile robotic units with limited sensory abilities. Solitaire robotic units with a limited sensor-range drive around in the environment (being in the state of dynamic random coupling), searching for a to-be-built robotic organism. As soon as they find one, they try to find the right place to dock on the robotic organism (indicated by a docking signal on the surface of the robotic organism). While doing this the robotic unit has to avoid all kinds of obstacles, be it other robotic units attracted by the robotic organism, be it already finished parts of the robotic organism itself. If the given goal is to increase the building efficiency (e.g., regarding speed), it would be advantageous to organize the mobile units to move in groups in the environment, i.e., with a dynamic correlated coupling. This is to decrease the occurrence of jamming effects and the number of collisions. Thus, it leads to a higher supply of robotic modules to the areas where the building process of the multi-robotic organism (representing the level of static coupling) takes place. The method presented here automatically leads to a balance between the two extremes of coupling levels. It is the bio-inspired approach of Virtual Embryogenesis (VE) [70,67,18,66]. The VE process, in detail explained in [70,68], is a model of processes observable during the evolution of the developmental process controlling the growth of biological embryos. In nature the function of a cell in an embryo is determined by its position within the growing body. A cell draws the information about its position from self-organized processes, which include the interaction of diffusing substances, called morphogens (for more details see [15,41,33]) with the genome of the cells of the embryo. Morphogens are emitted and detected by the cells of the embryo. The reaction of a cell (e.g., growth, specialization, duplication, emission of other morphogens) to a given concentration is determined by the genome of the cell. VE models these processes and allows the evolution of self-organized building processes, which are able to react dynamically to noise in the environment or even to damage taken by the growing virtual embryo during the growth process [69]. Please note, that the VE-system develops a reactive building process resulting in a morphological structure, and not a morphological structure alone. 4.1 Virtual Embryogenesis (VE) To investigate, how a system can switch from one extreme coupling state (mentioned in Section 1) into another, we developed a simulated experimental setup to observe the evolution of a behavioral program. This program allows individual autonomous robots to behave in a dynamical random and dynamical correlated coupling level of a collective, and in parallel build a multi-robotic organism with static coupling consisting of these autonomous robots. All experiments shown in this paper are based on simulation experiments using the simulation environment Netlogo 4.1.2 [72]. The models presented in [70,69] were adapted to the problem of organizing assembly processes in modular robotics [46,63]. The cells of the embryo are represented by virtual individual robotic modules (see Fig. 9 ), which are able to move in a simulated environment (Fig. 10 ). For technical details of the basic VE-system (e.g, genetic encoding, simulated physics, simulated diffusion of morphogens) see [70,68,69]. To answer the given questions regarding the evolvability of a behavioral program able to control individual behavior of autonomous robots as well as a multi-robotic building process, we modified the VE system described in [70] in the following way: \u2022 We adapted the VE system in a way, that the former cells of the virtual embryo are now models of docked robots inside a statically coupled robotic organism (comparable to the experiments described [69]): To increase the size of the robotic organism the docked robots have to turn on a \u2018docking signal\u2019 (see Fig. 9 and Fig. 13(a)). This signal can be seen by autonomous robots (described in detail below), which then have the possibility to react to this docking signal, approach the robot emitting the signal and dock to it. This way the growth process of biological organisms (as described in [70]) is emulated in this system. Due to the fact, that robots can only produce these \u2018docking signals\u2019 at the outer boarders of the robotic organism, the growth of the organism takes place only at these boarders. A \u2018pushing around\u2019 of robots (as described in [70]) within the robotic organism is not possible, due to the fact, that during the building process of the robotic organism the robots are already physically coupled to each other. \u2022 As mentioned above we implemented agents, which are able to move around in the environment in a Braitenberg-vehicle manner [12]. These agents are called \u2018movers\u2019 and represent individual robotic units with dynamic coupling. If a mover crashes into any obstacle, be it another mover or the growing robotic organism (without the intend to dock there), it is removed from the experiment. The movers are controlled by the same genetic code as the robots that build the robotic organism. This way the genome has to solve two problems: On the one hand, the genome has to deliver a behavioral program that allows an individual robot to operate efficiently together with other robots in a given environment. The tasks that are to fulfill are: \u2018do not crash into obstacles\u2019, and \u2018find the right place at the growing robotic organism and dock there\u2019. On the other hand, the same genome has to solve the problem of building a robotic organism within the given constraints of the fitness function, as described in [67]. The movers have two distance sensors for obstacles of any kind, placed in the front of the robots (\u00b145\u00b0 relative heading, see Fig. 9), with an opening angle of 45\u00b0, and one single central sensor, heading to the front, able to detect a docking light (opening angle 10\u00b0, see Fig. 9). The sensor values are fed as morphogen levels into the VE system, the actuators (left and right motor) are controlled by special protein levels (comparable to the proteins described in [70], Table 1 ). The motor is set to \u2018driving\u2019 by default, the produced proteins were able to modulate the speed of the wheels to control the driving direction and speed of the single robot. The authors are aware of the fact, that only some parts of the VE system (genome, proteins) are adapted for the control of individual robots, and other parts, which are essential for an EvoDevo system (e.g., the diffusion of morphogens within an organism), are removed for the purpose of controlling a moving robot. Please note that these essential parts are of course used during the organization of the growth process. \u2022 As soon as a mover has docked to the robotic organism, it becomes part of the robotic organisms and looses its ability to move around in the environment. The robotic organism itself is not able to move. To investigate how good the adapted VE system is able to evolve genomes for body formation and individual robot control in parallel, we performed two experiments: \u2022 One experiment with a fitness-function that required a fast growing process. This way we wanted to put pressure on the genome to develop well reacting movers. As a target-pattern, we choose a square (see Fig. 11 (a)). Please note, that the target pattern is bigger than the number of robots available, to allow all kinds of shapes to develop within this experiment, as long as they develop fast. \u2022 One experiment with a fitness-function that required a precise growing process. With these experiments we wanted to investigate, how the adapted VE system handles the problem of the evolution of a complex building procedure and the evolution of a controller for the movers. As target shape we used a \u2018H\u2019, as depicted in Fig. 11(b). All experiments were performed for 100 generations, each with 50 individual genomes per generation. Each individual genome was tested for 80 time-steps. All simulated robots (\u2018movers\u2019 and modules in the robotic organism) within one experiment were run by the same genome. Each evolutionary run was repeated 6 times. Default-speed of individual robots was set to 0.5 patches/time-step. World size was set to 31\u00d731 patches. All other settings (except the changes of the system mentioned above) are identical to [69]. Please note, that all experiments were finished after 100 generations, even if no optimal solution was found. With the given settings, optimized for the scientific questions raised above, the VE system did not develop even near optimal results. The experiments are designed to investigate the ability of the VE system to control individual agents, not to develop perfect body shapes. The optimization of the presented process for given applications is topic of ongoing investigations. The evaluation of different behaviors was done manually with a post-evaluation process, in which the best evolved genomes of each generation were tested in a scenario, which consisted only of one-module robotic organisms and 2 movers. The reaction of the movers regarding objects in the arena and docking signals in the senor range was classified in the four categories as described below and it was recorded. The analysis of the genomes evolved in the described experiments showed that four types of behavioral classes of the movers had evolved, differing in the ability of the movers to react to the environment: \u2022 \u2018No reaction\u2019 (see Fig. 12 (a)). The movers moved straight through the arena, without any reaction to any kind of sensory input. \u2022 \u2018Uphill-walkers\u2019 (see Fig. 12(b)). The movers reacted to docking-lights in the sensor-range by approaching and docking to the robotic organisms. \u2022 \u2018Reactive robots\u2019 (see Fig. 12(c)). The movers reacted to obstacles in the environment by changing its direction. Docking lights were ignored. \u2022 \u2018Swarm robots\u2019 (see Fig. 12(d)). The movers reacted not only to docking-lights in the sensor-range, but also to other robots in sensor range by following them. The result was that groups of robots were cruising through the environment (see Fig. 13 (b)). These four behavioral classes led to different behavioral patterns on group level which can be assigned to the coupling levels: Dynamic random coupling is observed in those groups, in which individual robots did not interact with each other, or reacted to each other in an uncoordinated manner showed an evenly distribution of group members within the environment. Those groups, that consisted of \u2018movers\u2019 which followed each other, showed a simple flocking behavior (depicted in Fig. 13) and thus, belong to the level of dynamic correlated coupling. To investigate, if the adapted VE process is able to react to different conditions during the evolutionary process, two different fitness functions were used (described above). It showed that during evolution the number of developed reactive patterns increased with the necessity of a faster growth process. The frequencies of the observed \u201cfollowing behaviors\u201d are depicted in Table 1. In this section we have shown that a system that masters the transition from dynamic random coupling to dynamic correlated coupling and also to static coupling can be synthesized by artificial evolution. 5 Conclusion and discussion In this article we reported bio-inspired swarm algorithms that deal with the problem of high volatility in information due to high dynamics in neighborhood relations and algorithms that focus on introducing more flexibility to statically coupled systems, that is, driving swarm systems away from the two extremes of coupling towards the moderate solution of dynamic correlated couplings. With the bio-inspiration of our approaches we aim for general principles although we often refer to robotic agents in this work. We propose that the moderate level of coupling is to be favored because the two extremes (left and right hand side of Fig. 1) come with several drawbacks as discussed above. With the BEECLUST algorithm we investigated an algorithm which implements a transition from dynamic random coupling to dynamic correlated coupling which allows for stable information transfers within limited time periods. In this paper BEECLUST was investigated as a mere clustering process in a homogeneous environment. In other settings, for example as reported in [25], BEECLUST is run in an inhomogeneous environment and interpreted as a collective decision process. The above principle of generating dynamic correlated couplings is a prerequisite for collective divisions. Only if there is a reliable neighborhood a cluster is able to converge on a locally defined consensus. However, at the same time these neighborhoods should not be too static and have at least some exchange on a global level with other regions and clusters to stay adaptive to a dynamic environment. The presented results of AHHS were focused on investigations of several topologies of statically coupled systems. In addition, AHHS is designed to cope with scaling topologies and even dynamic transitions between topologies [26]. Due to the fact that AHHS is also used in single agents with a virtual inner structure [61,54] its functionality can be related to that of the described VE-system. Even though the transient from random moving agents to a statically coupled collective system is possible with AHHS, it was originally not intended to operate that way. It was designed to perform in a modular, but physically coupled system. The reported results, here, show that both internal communication and internal states can be implemented by this approach. Hence, the algorithm is capable to perform in reconfigurable system, is robust to dynamical changes, and implements a considerable flexibility. In addition, the FGRN was also used to control a physics-based simulated coupled system. In the implemented system, there was no explicit communication between the units but all the units used their local sensors. Since the dynamics of the system is restricted due to the physical coupling of the units, the information provided by each sensor reflects to some extent the status of the other units and is considered an implicit communication between the units. This implicit communication via environmental feedback increases flexibility and it can be extendable to more complex configurations. The VE-system allows an evolutionary approach to the problem of balancing the two extreme sides of level of coupling in mobile robotic units while building a multi-robotic organism. Punishing the system for collisions by removing mobile robotic units (which are the substrate for the building process of the robotic organism) yields an effective evolution of VE-systems. These VE-systems generate behavioral programs (coded into the genome of the VE), which are able to organize the swarm phase and also a reactive building process for a robotic organism. It showed that the evolving genomes react to different levels of evolutionary pressure by development of different levels of reactive controllers for robot motion. Whether the parallel evolution of two behaviors within one genome is limited compared to a modular approach, is subject to ongoing research. For the future we plan, besides optimizing the VE, to adapt the described process to real-world robotic hardware (first results regarding this topic are presented in [18]). We plan to investigate in detail, how the \u2018self-healing\u2019 abilities of the VE (described in [69]) are influenced by the ability to coordinate growth-processes on the organism level and swarm phase in parallel. We will use the presented model also to investigate the interactions of genes relevant for \u2018mover\u2019 control with those relevant for body formation. Subject of ongoing research is the integration of the FGRN-system, the AHHS approach, and the VE process in a modular software approach with hand-overs between controllers at run-time to produce a robust, self-organizing software system with maximal flexibility operating on all levels of coupling. Finally, the research based on the levels-of-coupling perspective will be pursued in both design of swarm algorithms for artificial systems and as a guiding principle for models of natural swarms.

The network, utilizing a multilayer perceptron architecture, was trained on data from 769 impact tests, for which it accurately predicted the perforation of the shield rear wall (or lack thereof) 92% of the time. Comparatively, the leading empirical approach is capable of accurately predicting the outcome of 71% of the impact tests. The network lso provides physically plausible confidence bounds (i.e. error bars). Interrogation of the network was performed to identify the input parameters that most heavily correlated with the output prediction. Although the majority of the traditional parameters (i.e. those identified in the empirical ballistic limit equation) were amongst the most influential, some unexpected (and potentially spurious) parameters were also identified. A more widely sampled set of training data incorporating increased diversity in projectile and target materials would likely improve the network internal weighting for material properties and avoid accidental identification of biases in the training exemplars. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Analytical or empirical equations are commonly used to predict the perforation of armor systems by impacting projectiles. Due to the complexity of material behavior and target response under high strain-rate loading, these equations predominantly apply a number of simplifying assumptions and include empirical parameters or curve fits. Inherently, therefore, these equations are limited to application on projectile/target interactions similar to those used in deriving the empirical coefficients. Advanced statistical methods now have the capacity to significantly improve our modeling of complex problems with many, and often unanticipated, contributing factors and inherent non-linearities. Such an approach can also transgress traditional borders in empirical algorithm development based on specific projectile and target types. Common characteristics/patterns should be identifiable in non-similar interactions, for example, fragment simulating projectiles impacting rolled homogenous armor at 100 m/s and aluminum alloy spheres impacting spaced aluminum armor, i.e. Whipple shield, at hypervelocity, something limited in empirical approaches. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been developed for predicting the perforation limits of aluminum Whipple shields impacted by spherical aluminum projectiles at hypervelocity. This particular interaction has been selected as a proof-of-concept demonstrator due to the large volume of unclassified test data available and the decades-long development of the state-of-the-art empirical approach for predicting the perforation limits.

Test database The performance of aluminum Whipple shields against micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) particles has been extensively investigated since 1958 [1]. For this study, a total of 769 impact tests were collated from a range of references, a summary of which is provided in Table 1. The tests presented in Table 1 were all performed with spherical aluminum/aluminum alloy projectiles and did not include multi-layer insulation (MLI) blankets. The database includes tests performed at normal (72%) and oblique incidence (28%), with impact velocities ranging from 0.6906 km/s to 9.89 km/s. There is wide variation in projectile and target geometry combinations, including projectile diameter to bumper thickness ratios, d p /t b , of 0.1 to 25.3, shield spacing to projectile diameter ratios, S/d p , of 0 to 96.5, and non-dimensional geometric parameters, t w 2 S/t b 3 (from [2]), from 0 to 494261. 3. Artificial neural network The neural architecture utilized in this study is known as a multilayer perceptron, or MLP, a common feed-forward artificial neural network. The MLP consists of a system of interconnected processing nodes (or neurons) that absorb arbitrarily complex and often non-linear mappings between two vector spaces for pattern recognition. Effectively a nested fit, MLPs are not amenable to the linear matrix techniques typically employed in regression fits. At their most basic, an MLP consists of three layers: an input layer, intermediate (or hidden) layer, and output layer, shown in Fig. 1. Table 1.

For this study, the test data presented in Table 1 was used for training the MLP. A total of 57 inputs were used in the MLP, covering material properties, impact conditions, and shield geometry (shown in Fig. 2). The network output layer was a single node that provided a boolean prediction of Whipple shield perforation (P(perf)=1) or not (P(perf)=0). The network is trained on the test exemplars using a simple algorithm called back-propagation that iteratively corrects the connection weights until a global prediction error, E, is minimized. Typically, the global prediction error of a neural net is reported as the root-mean-square (RMS) training error, which is the average Euclidean distance between actual and desired network output patterns, the latter representing the experimental data (see, for instance [15]). 33 Shannon Ryan and Stephen Thaler / Procedia Engineering 58 ( 2013 ) 31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 38 Fig. 1. A multi-layer perceptron [14] consisting of an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. 3.1. Confidence bounds The output of the MLP was an analogue prediction of the probability of perforation, P(perf), based on experimental conditions and shield design. The analogue prediction was then categorized as a perforation, P(perf)=1, or non-perforation, P(perf)=0, with the sigmoidal output of the MLP connecting these two plateaus (see Fig. 3). Three key points on this sigmoid were identified through application of an algorithm that searched it for (1) P(perf) = 0.5, identifying the critical level of any input parameter leading to perforation, (2) P(perf) = 0.1, and (3) P(perf) = 0.9. The latter two points were used to establish the width of the sigmoid, effectively defining an 80% confidence channel as an approximate measure of experimental error. The probabilistic nature of this output becomes evident when considering contradictory results (i.e. a mixture of pass/fail experiments for the same, or near identical conditions) as the learning algorithm seeks the minimum error in fitting inconsistent results. Less ambiguous test data produces sharp transitions in the sigmoid and thus lower magnitude uncertainty in the prediction, whereas experimental uncertainty broadens the sigmoid fit, shown in Fig. 3. 3.2. Network skeletonisation/input weighting A common criticism in the use of neural networks for engineering app - it is inherently difficult to rapidly identify the key parameters and relationships within a trained net. Empirical techniques, conversely, may be less accurate, but provide a sense of security in that the influences of the parameters are directly apparent in the equation. To address this, the network was interrogated to identify and better understand the absorbed schema within the net (i.e. the key network inputs and interplay of connection weights in determining network outputs). The results of this analysis are shown in the two hidden layer nodes with the largest magnitude connection weights). In the table we can identify some traditional parameters such as wall thickness, projectile velocity, shield standoff, etc amongst the most influential inputs. However, some expectedly important parameters such as projectile density and wall yield strength correlate less significantly with shield failure than some parameters not even considered in the empirical BLE, such as projectile tensile modulus, bumper linear coefficient of thermal expansion, wall electrical resistivity, etc. Further investigation is required to generate a fully validated list of critical factors, as the preliminary results are expected to be heavily influenced by issues in the statistical sampling of the data. 34 Shannon Ryan and Stephen Thaler / Procedia Engineering 58 ( 2013 ) 31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 38 Fig. 2. Architecture of the artificial neural network used for predicting shield perforation. The network contains 57 nodes in the input layer (covering material properties, impact conditions and shield geometry), 14 nodes in the hidden layer, and a single node in the output layer (57/14/1 architecture) providing a boolean prediction of Whipple shield perforation (P(perf)=1) or not (P(perf)=0). 35 Shannon Ryan and Stephen Thaler / Procedia Engineering 58 ( 2013 ) 31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 38 Fig. 3.

Results The predictive network was trained to an RMS error of 0.10 on all 769 exemplars presented in Table 1. This corresponded to accurate predictions of the Pass/Fail result ( ) for 92.2% of t Comparatively, the JSC Whipple shield BLE [16] correctly predicts the result in 71% of the tests, including 80% accuracy for . In Fig. 4 the ANN output is plotted in terms of critical wall thickness required to defeat the test projectile (i.e. design curve). The curve provides an excellent fit of test data for velocities between ~2.5 km/s and 7 km/s. Above 7 km/s the magnitude of the confidence channel is seen to significantly increase, due to ambiguity in the test data for similar shield configurations. Part of this ambiguity is due to inconsistency in the definition of failure amongst the test data sources in Table 1. In some instances, failure was defined as the onset of detached spall, while others specified failure upon gas leak or light transmission through the shield rear wall. Above ~7.2 km/s the ANN designs a rear wall thickness approaching zero. This is likely due to an absence of high velocity test data for comparable shield geometries, and the influence of tests performed on the same shield geometry at 45 and 60 and 60 with rear wall thicknesses of 0.3175 cm and 0.2286 cm respectively. In Fig. 5 the ANN output is plotted in terms of critical projectile diameter required to defeat a specific shield configuration based on test SS-T2-2 from [9] (i.e. performance curve). In the figure, test data on similar configurations is also supplied. The ANN is shown to provide a good fit to the test data, particularly in comparison with the BLE. An 4.47 km/s. Due to the degree of scatter in hypervelocity impact testing, it is unlikely that even the most perfect predictive system could provide 100% accuracy (indeed ~90% may be the functional limit). The increasing critical diameter predictions above ~8 km/s are due to a lack of training data in this regime and are, as such, not valid. The ANN curves in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show a number of additional features that, interestingly, correspond well with the phenomenological curve presented by Hopkins et al. in [17]. Some key features from the phenomenological curve can be identified, such as 1) an intact projectile; 2) the onset of projectile shatter; 3) limit of projectile fragmentation, and; 4) onset of projectile melting.

Summary and conclusions An artificial neural network (ANN) has been utilized to predict the perforation limits of aluminum Whipple shields under hypervelocity impact. The network, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, has been built with inputs for material properties, Whipple shield geometry and impact conditions, and trained on a database of 769 impact tests collated from a range of sources. The output of the network was an analogue probability of perforation that was subsequently classified as a sigmoidal fit between perforation and non-perforation test results. This fit provided a physically plausible confidence channel (i.e. prediction error bounds) that defined a region of mixed pass/fail behavior, the size of which is dependent on ambiguity or conflicting results in the test data. Skeletonisation of the network was performed in order to identify the key traces through the hidden layer and measure the influence, and hence importance, of the input parameters. The interrogation revealed some traditional parameters amongst the critical inputs, such as wall thickness, projectile velocity and shield standoff, but also identified some unexpectedly important parameters such as projectile tensile modulus, bumper linear coefficient of thermal expansion, wall electrical resistivity, etc. These latter input parameters may be accidently identified by the network if the training data unwittingly used, for example, high resistivity materials in perforated shield designs and low resistivity materials in those that passed. A more widely sampled set of training data incorporating increased diversity in projectile and target materials would be expected to improve the network internal weighting for material parameters, as would a balanced design of experiments. The ANN model was able to provide accurate Pass/Fail predictions for 92% of the 769 impact tests collected for this study. The leading empirical ballistic limit equation (BLE), comparatively, was found to be accurate for 71% of the tests. In addition to significantly increased accuracy, the network predictions are provided with confidence bounds, something lacking in current empirical methodologies. Furthermore, the ANN outputs were found to reproduce phenomenological curves, with key features such as shatter peak and melt peak easily identifiable. Currently, the ANN model is limited to application in the parameter space over which clusters of measurements (i.e. HVI tests) exist, plus approximately 10% extrapolation in any parameter beyond these hypervolumes. To extend the application of the ANN, new data outside these regimes (e.g. very high and very low velocities) is required, preferably in a uniform sampling of the parameter space with equal proportions of pass and fail results. In addition to extending the application of the Whipple shield net to velocity extremes (both high and low), the ANN should be extendable to a wide range of other problems of interest, including: non-spherical projectiles, non-Whipple shielding configurations (e.g. honeycomb core 38 Shannon Ryan and Stephen Thaler / Procedia Engineering 58 ( 2013 ) 31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 38 sandwich panels, stuffed Whipple shields, Nextel multi-shock shields etc.) and other impact regimes (e.g. ballistic). Such extensions are, in theory, only limited by the amount of test data available. References 1. Willig, F.J. and H.W. Semon, A Multi-Stage H.E.

An artificial neural network model has been developed for predicting the perforation limits of spaced aluminum armor (aka Whipple shield) under impact of aluminum projectiles at hypervelocity. The network, utilizing a multilayer perceptron architecture, was trained on data from 769 impact tests, for which it accurately predicted the perforation of the shield rear wall (or lack thereof) 92% of the time. Comparatively, the leading empirical approach is capable of accurately predicting the outcome of 71% of the impact tests. The network output is an analogue probability of perforation, which is adjusted to a binary \u201cPass\u201d/\u201cFail\u201d result via a sigmoid fit that also provides physically plausible confidence bounds (i.e. error bars). Interrogation of the network was performed to identify the input parameters that most heavily correlated with the output prediction. Although the majority of the traditional parameters (i.e. those identified in the empirical ballistic limit equation) were amongst the most influential, some unexpected (and potentially spurious) parameters were also identified. A more widely sampled set of training data incorporating increased diversity in projectile and target materials would likely improve the network internal weighting for material properties and avoid accidental identification of biases in the training exemplars.

The artificial bee colony algorithm (ABCA) was first adopted in topology optimization for dynamic problems. The objective was to obtain a structure with the highest fundamental natural frequency in a certain amount of material, based on the contributed structural sensitivity of each element calculated by the waggle index and eigenvalue. The waggle index update rule, evaluation method of fitness values, and changing filtering size scheme are suggested for obtaining a stable and robust optimal topology based on the ABCA. Examples are provided to examine the applicability and effectiveness of the ABCA compared to bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO). The following conclusions are obtained through the results of examples based on the ABCA; (1) the ABCA, using the three suggested methods, is very applicable and effective in topology optimization for obtaining a stable and robust optimal layout. (2) It is found that the natural frequencies of the ABCA are always higher than those of the BESO, and average convergence rates of the ABCA are similar or faster than those of the BESO. (3) The optimal topology from the ABCA is nearly obtained in a half stage of the convergence iteration, since volume constraint is applied from the beginning. Keywords Artificial bee colony algorithm Topology optimization Natural frequency Stochastic search method Finite element method 1 Introduction The goal of structural optimization is to achieve the best performance from a structure while satisfying various constraints, such as a certain amount of material and specific mechanical conditions. For the past several decades, topology optimization techniques such as the homogenization method [1], the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method [2], the evolutionary structural optimization (ESO/BESO) method [3], and the level set technique [4] have been developed. These methods have been successfully adopted in topology optimization for static, dynamic, and practical engineering problems. Natural frequency optimization is critically important in many engineering fields. While much research has been devoted to stiffness optimization, relatively fewer studies have been concerned with natural frequency optimization problems. Furthermore, several issues are encountered when performing frequency optimization with the above methods. The most important problem among them is that modal analysis for topology optimization suffers from highly localized vibrating modes in low-density regions that have relatively low eigenvalues. Considering one or some of the lowest modes in topology optimization, these highly localized vibrating modes are troublesome. To resolve them optimization formulation maximizing localized buckling modes with a mesh-independency filter has been proposed. Alternatively, several techniques involving mass density interpolation have also been proposed without changing the optimization formulation [5\u20139]. The hard-kill ESO/BESO method effectively prevents localized vibration modes from occurring by directly eliminating elements from the full design domain. However, as pointed out by Rozvany [10], it is computationally inefficient and non-rational for sensitivity analysis when applied to optimization problems. Recently, the above-mentioned deficiencies of the BESO method have been overcome by Huang and Xie [3]. In dynamic optimization problems, this research was successfully applied to the soft-kill BESO method with a discrete design variable of 1 or a very low density [11]. There are also some studies that solve the natural frequency optimization using stochastic methods. For example, the genetic algorithm (GA) is applied for topology optimization to maximize the fundamental eigenfrequency of plates using random keys associated with graph theory [12], and the compliance and the second eigenfrequency of a swing-arm type actuator using a multi-objective function [13]. In addition, simulated annealing (SA) has been applied for topology optimization to maximize natural frequency of cantilever beam structures using morphological representation [14]. Recently, swarm-intelligence based algorithms, modeled after an artificial bee colony, have been applied in engineering design optimization processes. Karaboga et al. [15\u201317] published a survey of the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABCA) and its applications. The researchers compared the solutions of the ABCA with those of differential evaluation, particle swarm optimization, and evolutionary algorithms such as GA and SA for unconstrained and constrained function optimization problems. The ABCA is also applied to multivariate data clustering and neural networks for classifying different data sets [18,19]. A sizing optimization algorithm [20] has also been proposed for solving discrete optimum design problems. The suggested algorithm was used to find the appropriate cross-sectional areas of truss structural members from an available profile list while satisfying design constraints. Although the ABCA has been successfully applied in sizing optimization problems, it has thus far never been employed in frequency topology optimization problems. The behavior of a bee colony searching for food sources is analogous to the process of searching for efficient elements that are suitable for a structure with the highest natural frequency. Therefore, a modified version of the original ABCA suggested by Karaboga et al. [15\u201317] is suggested here for frequency topology optimization problems. The purpose of this study is to suggest a method of applying the ABCA in the frequency topology optimization of structural models using finite element analysis. Since the original ABCA was used to find the optimum solution of continuous functions between upper and lower bounds, considerable modifications are made to the algorithm so that it may be applied for the frequency optimization of structural models. The implemented modifications are presented in Section 2.1. In addition, the three control parameters, namely colony size, maximum cycle number, and limit value must be tuned before performing the original ABCA. However, the three parameters in ABCA for topology optimization can be reduced to just one: the limit value for escaping from a local minimum and obtaining a reasonable optimal solution. When the ABCA is applied in topology optimization for natural frequency problems, an evaluating method of fitness values, a changing filtering size scheme and a waggle index update rule must be improved or developed. Because of a phenomenon where some of the fitness values may be concentrated in a very small range, which may occur in structures having a small natural frequency, an evaluating method of fitness values is improved to evenly distribute the values between 0 and 1. A changing filtering size scheme appropriate to the ABCA is also developed for obtaining a reasonable and better optimum structural layout. In addition, a waggle index update rule for evaluating elemental sensitivity in the topology optimization process is developed. The above improved or developed methods are explained in detail in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. Examples are provided to examine the effectiveness and applicability of the ABCA with the suggested three methods, and then compared to the soft-kill BESO. Through the examples, natural frequencies and average convergence rates of the ABCA are also compared with those of the BESO. As the results, it is found that the ABCA with the proposed methods is very applicable and effective in topology optimization for obtaining a stable and robust optimal layout. 2 Natural frequency optimization using the ABCA 2.1 Real bees and application of the ABCA in a discrete domain Honey bees are social insects that live in colonies consisting of a single queen, thousands of semi-sterile female workers, and some males (drones). All tasks, except for searching food sources, are associated with colony living. In a bee colony, foragers search for flower nectar from different food sources in multiple directions. While these foragers typically fly within a 3 km radius of the hive, they may venture up to 12 km from the hive in the search for food. After discovering a food source, the forager loads up with nectar, returns to the hive, and unloads the food. She (the forager) may subsequently inform her nest mates about her findings through a \u201cwaggle dance\u201d. Such a dance indicates the direction and distance of the food source from the hive, as well as the amount of nectar from the food source. As shown in Fig. 1 , a waggle dance conveys three pieces of information: (a) the angle of the straight part indicates the direction of the food source, (b) the length of the straight part indicates how far the food source is from the hive and (c) the duration of the dance gives information about the nectar quality. Most of the bees that watch the waggle dancer decide to follow her (the waggle dancer), while some of the bees leave the hive without following the dancer in order to search for a better food source than the one advertised in the dance. This means that each bee can choose one of three options after unloading the nectar: (a) abandon the food source and search for another promising flower patch, (b) continue to forage at the food source without recruiting nest mates, or (c) perform the waggle dance to recruit nest mates before returning to the food source. Each bee chooses one of the above options based on the food level of the nectar source. If a bee finds a nectar source above a certain limit, she follows option (c). If the food source has an average level of nectar, the bee forages at this source without recruiting nest mates. Otherwise, the bee continues to search for promising nectar sources (option (a)). The main goal for the bees is to find the most abundant nectar sources [20]. The ABCA is a swarm intelligent optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. In the ABCA, a colony of the artificial bees contains three groups of bees: employed bees, onlookers, and scouts. The first half of the colony consists of the employed bees and the second half includes the onlookers. For every food source, there is only one employed bee. The employed bee of an abandoned food source becomes a scout. The position of food sources represents possible solutions to an optimization problem, and the amount of nectar in the food sources corresponds to the quality of the associated solutions. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows [16]: \u2022 INITIALIZE \u2022 REPEAT (a) Place the employed bees on the food sources. (b) Place the onlookers on the food sources. (c) Send the scouts to search for new food sources. \u2022 UNTIL (requirements are met.) In order to apply for topology optimization based on the ABCA, variables of the original ABCA must be transformed into those for topology optimization to maximize natural frequency. That is, the entire search space in the original ABCA or real environment corresponds to the full design domain in topology optimization. A food source corresponds to each discretized element. The nectar amount of each food source corresponds to the fitness value of each element. Food sources occupied and abandoned by employed bees correspond to solid and void elements, respectively. In addition, the positions of the employed bee colony or promising nectar sources correspond to a candidate solution (layout) in topology optimization. The correspondence of variables in the real bee environment or the original ABCA to those in the ABCA for topology optimization is summarized in Table 1 . 2.2 Formulation of natural frequency optimization Excessive vibration due to resonance occurs when the frequency of a dynamic excitation is close to one of the natural frequencies of a structure. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict the fundamental or higher natural frequencies of a structure to a prescribed range in order to avoid severe vibration. In the finite element method, dynamic behavior of a structure is represented by the following general eigenvalue problem: (2.1) ( [ K ] \u2212 \u03c9 j 2 [ M ] ) { u j } = { 0 } where [ K ] is the global stiffness matrix, [ M ] is the global mass matrix, \u03c9 j is the j -th natural frequency, and { u j } is the eigenvector corresponding to \u03c9 j . The natural frequency \u03c9 j and the corresponding eigenvector { u j } are related by the Rayleigh quotient [11] as follows: (2.2) \u03c9 j 2 = { u j } T [ K ] { u j } { u j } T [ M ] { u j } . Here we consider topology optimization problems for maximizing the j -th natural frequency of vibrating continuum structures. For a solid-void design, the optimization problem can be stated as Eq. (2.3): Maximize : \u03c9 j (2.3) Subject to : \u03c7 \u2217 \u2212 \u2211 i = 1 N \u03c7 i = 0 \u03c7 i = { 1 if element is solid \u03c7 min if element is void where \u03c7 \u2217 and \u03c7 i denote a prescribed volume constraint and the presence/absence of the i -th element, respectively. \u03c7 i = \u03c7 min and \u03c7 i = 1 denote void and solid elements, respectively. N is the total number of elements in a structure. \u03c7 min (e.g., 0.001) is a small value used for denoting a void element to avoid highly localized modes. Swarm-intelligence algorithms applied for topology optimization must have an intermediate variable such as the pheromone of the ACO algorithm [21]. The intermediate variable plays a role in accumulating information of the colony. In other words, swarm-intelligence algorithms induce a candidate solution by gradually closing in on an optimal solution by accumulating information of efficient elements obtained from the every iteration. It is the reason that the ABCA, as a swarm-intelligence algorithm, also needs an intermediate variable. In this paper, the ABCA adopts the amount of information shared by bee colony as the intermediate variable. It is defined as waggle index, I i . A waggle index update rule is developed as a simple algebraic equation based on the amount of information shared on each element from the previous iteration and the presence/absence of the employed bees in the present iteration, which is updated by Eq. (2.4): I i ( k ) = \u03b4 \u00d7 I i ( k \u2212 1 ) + ( 1 \u2212 \u03b4 ) \u00d7 e i ( k ) where k : the number of the k - th iteration (2.4) I i : waggle index (amount of information shared on the i - th element) e i : employed bee presence/absence ( 1 / \u03c7 min ) \u03b4 : waggle index update coefficient where the waggle index update coefficient, \u03b4 is empirically appropriate to be 0.8 for natural frequency optimization problems. It represents the amount of information that should be transferred to bee colony in the next iteration. Applying the waggle index to the SIMP model to calculate elemental sensitivity [2], likewise the pheromone of the ACO algorithm for topology optimization, the material density and Young\u2019s modulus are functions of the intermediate design variable. That is, waggle index, I i , is as follows: (2.5) \u03c1 ( I i ) = I i \u03c1 1 E ( I i ) = I i p E 1 ( 0 < I min \u2264 I i \u2264 1 ) where \u03c1 1 and E 1 are the density and Young\u2019s modulus of solid elements, respectively. p is the penalty factor. Also, an alternative material interpolation scheme [11] for avoiding very low density can be expressed as (2.6) \u03c1 ( I i ) = I i \u03c1 1 E ( I i ) = [ I min \u2212 I min p 1 \u2212 I min p ( 1 \u2212 I i p ) + I i p ] E 1 ( 0 < I min \u2264 I i \u2264 1 ) . The parameter f i can be defined as elemental sensitivity, which is an indicator of the natural frequency change with respect to the waggle index of each element. It is calculated by Eq. (2.7) (2.7) f i = d \u03c9 j d I i = 1 2 \u03c9 j u j T ( 1 \u2212 I min 1 \u2212 I min p p I i p \u2212 1 K i \u2212 \u03c9 j 2 M i ) u j ( 0 < I min \u2264 I i \u2264 1 ) where \u03c9 j is the j -th natural frequency, M i is the mass matrix of each element, K i is the stiffness matrix of each element, and u j is the eigenvector of each element corresponding to \u03c9 j . 2.3 ABCA for natural frequency optimization Food sources that are exploited by the employed bees represent a candidate solution for a given optimization problem, and the nectar amount of each food source corresponds to a fitness value of each element as a measure to decide which element is more efficient in a full design domain. Fitness value, denoted by temp _ fit i , is evaluated using the elemental sensitivity of the i -th element as follows [17]: (2.8a) temp _ fit i = { 1 1 + f i ( f i \u2265 0 ) 1 + | f i | ( f i < 0 ) where f i : the elemental sensitivity of the i - th element . Fitness is simply calculated by Eq. (2.8a) in the original ABCA. However, in the case that the number of elements is large enough, the fitness values of elements are distributed in various manners. In other words, relative differences in fitness values are sometimes very difficult to be compared to each other since very small values might be distributed in a very small range according to the problem. In order to give clear differences of these values, an evaluation method of fitness values, denoted by fit i as Eq. (2.8b) suggests. This makes the distribution linear from 0 to 1 by setting the median value of the distribution to be 0.5, is suggested as follows: fit i = 0.5 \u00d7 { temp _ fit i \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i ) } [ med ( temp _ fit i ) \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i ) ] ( min ( temp _ fit i ) \u2264 temp _ fit i < med ( temp _ fit i ) ) (2.8b) fit i = 0.5 \u00d7 { temp _ fit i \u2212 med ( temp _ fit i ) } [ max ( temp _ fit i ) \u2212 med ( temp _ fit i ) ] + 0.5 ( med ( temp _ fit i ) \u2264 temp _ fit i < max ( temp _ fit i ) ) where , min : minimum value, max : maximum value, med : median value . As the first step (employed bee phase) of the ABCA for topology optimization, all employed bees that leave the hive to search for promising nectar sources are initialized or chosen randomly over the full design domain according to Eq. (2.9) [17] \u03bd i j = { z i j + \u03d5 i j ( z i j \u2212 z k j ) if z i j \u2260 z k j z i j otherwise where , z i j = [ rand [ 0 , 1 ] \u00d7 ( number of all elements ) ] (2.9) z k j = [ rand [ 0 , 1 ] \u00d7 ( number of all elements ) ] \u03bd i j = abs [ Int [ z i j + [ \u03d5 i j \u00d7 ( z i j \u2212 z k j ) ] ] ] \u03d5 i j : random number generated in the range [ \u2212 1 , 1 ] abs : absolute value, Int : integer value, rand : random number . In Eq. (2.9), the index j can be ignored because the two-dimensional index number can be expressed as an integer number in MATLAB. The variables z i j , z k j , and \u03bd i j denote two arbitrary positions of elements in the old solution (layout), and a temporary candidate position based on z i j and z k j , respectively. In other words, the subscripts i and k indicate the index of each discretized element randomly chosen in the full design domain. A position having the best fitness value among the three positions \u03bd i j , z i j , and z k j in every iteration inside of employed bee phase, by comparing their fitness values, is stored. As the second step (onlooker bee phase) of the ABCA for topology optimization, an onlooker bee chooses a food source depending on the probability value p i associated with the i -th element. If the index j is also ignored, a temporary candidate position \u03bd i j \u2032 from two arbitrary positions of the elements in the old solution z i j \u2032 and z k j \u2032 can be generated as follows [17]: (2.10) p i = fit i \u2211 j = 1 n fit j \u03bd i j \u2032 = z i j \u2032 + \u03d5 i j \u2032 ( z i j \u2032 \u2212 z k j \u2032 ) where z i j \u2032 = [ rand [ 0 , 1 ] \u00d7 ( number of all elements ) ] z k j \u2032 = [ rand [ 0 , 1 ] \u00d7 ( number of all elements ) ] \u03bd i j \u2032 = abs [ Int [ z i j \u2032 + [ \u03c6 i j \u2032 \u00d7 ( z i j \u2032 \u2212 z k j \u2032 ) ] ] ] \u03c6 i j \u2032 : random number generated in the range [ \u2212 1 , 1 ] abs : absolute value, Int : integer value, rand = random number . The procedure for searching a temporary candidate position \u03bd i j \u2032 is performed by choosing two arbitrary positions, z i j \u2032 and z k j \u2032 only in the case of satisfying the condition, rand [ 0 , 1 ] < p i , for each element in the full design domain. That is, an improved candidate position is searched by increasing the probability of the employed bees\u2019 movements to food sources with larger fitness values through an increase in the number of random trials (roulette-wheel method). A position having the best fitness value among the three positions \u03bd i j \u2032 , z i j \u2032 , and z k j \u2032 in every iteration inside of onlooker bee phase, by comparing their fitness values, is stored. In the final step (scout bee phase) of the ABCA for topology optimization, if there is no improvement in the amount of nectar from a certain food source after a predefined number of trials (i.e. limit value), the food source is discarded by its employed bee in the original ABCA. This employed bee then becomes a \u201cscout\u201d. If a scout accidentally discovers a rich, previously unknown food source without any guidance as to its location, the scout becomes an employed bee [15\u201317]. When the ABCA is applied in problems that involve searching for the minimum point of a continuous function or a sizing optimization process, the role of the scout bees is used for escaping from the local minimum solution and accidentally discovering a rich food source. In a topology optimization problem, the role of scout bees can be performed by direct normalizing and changing filtering size schemes, as below. Then, a candidate solution can be determined from the candidate positions stored in employed and onlooker bee phases using a prescribed volume constraint. Meanwhile, even though some elements have been abandoned at the present iteration, they may be occupied again (reactive) at later iterations according to the fitness values calculated by Eq. (2.8b) using the waggle index included in Eq. (2.7). A direct normalizing scheme [11] is improved in Eq. (2.11c) for removing a local optimum layout caused by the fitness values in the previous iteration, and for accelerating the change in the fitness value of each element. Changing filtering size scheme is also suggested in Eq. (2.12) for removing the cleft or biased layout by filtering the fitness values at a wider range. If the iteration number equals the limit value and the convergence criterion is not satisfied, the direct normalizing scheme and the changing filtering size scheme are performed. In the ABCA for the topology optimization, the limit value (only one control parameter) must be tuned before applying the algorithm. Limit value is defined as follows: (2.11a) limit value = predetermined number of trials (control parameter) limit value_step ( n ) = limit value \u00d7 n ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 ) . A simple averaging scheme [11] should be employed for stabilizing the fluctuation of fitness values at the every iteration so that evolutionary history can be stable for obtaining an optimal layout. A simple averaging scheme with the same reason as Eq. (2.8b) is also improved and implemented as follows: fit i ( k + 1 ) = fit i ( k ) + fit i ( k \u2212 1 ) 2 where , f i ( k ) : elemental sensitivity of the i - th element in the k - th iteration (2.11b) k ( iteration number ) \u2260 limit value_step ( n ) temp _ fit i ( k ) = { 1 1 + f i ( k ) ( f i ( k ) \u2265 0 ) 1 + | f i ( k ) | ( f i ( k ) < 0 ) fit i ( k ) = 0.5 \u00d7 { temp _ fit i ( k ) \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) } med ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) ( min ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) \u2264 temp _ fit i ( k ) < med ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) ) fit i ( k ) = 0.5 \u00d7 { temp _ fit i ( k ) \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) } med ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) ( min ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) \u2264 temp _ fit i ( k ) < med ( temp _ fit i ( k ) ) ) . However, if a simple averaging scheme is applied to the ABCA for topology optimization, it has a slight disadvantage in the convergence rate. Therefore, for an accelerating convergence rate, the following direct normalizing scheme is applied when the iteration number equals the limit value and the convergence criterion is not satisfied. A direct normalizing scheme [11] with the same reason as Eq. (2.8b) is improved and implemented as follows: (2.11c) fit i ( k + 1 ) = 0.5 \u00d7 { temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) } [ med ( temp _ fit i k + 1 ) \u2212 min ( temp _ fit i k + 1 ) ] ( min ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) \u2264 temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) < med ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) ) fit i ( k + 1 ) = 0.5 \u00d7 { temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) \u2212 med ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) } max ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) \u2212 med ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) + 0.5 ( med ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) \u2264 temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) < max ( temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) ) ) where , f i ( k ) : the elemental sensitivity of the i - th element in the k - th iteration k (iteration number) = limit value _ step ( n ) temp _ fit i ( k + 1 ) = { 1 1 + f i ( k ) ( f i ( k ) \u2265 0 ) 1 + | f i ( k ) | ( f i ( k ) < 0 ) . Changing filtering size scheme is needed to obtain a reasonable and stable solution as well as prevent the occurrence of a checkerboard pattern when the finite element method is used for the ABCA for topology optimization. If the ABCA for topology optimization is performed with the original mesh-independency filter scheme [22], it may produce unreasonable structures such as cleft or biased structural parts. To overcome these problems, filtering size, r min needs to be controlled to become gradually larger as a candidate solution becomes close to an optimum solution. Therefore, changing filtering size scheme is suggested in order to suppress the cleft or biased layout as follows: f i = \u2211 k = 1 M w ( r i k ) f k n o d e \u2211 k = 1 M w ( r i k ) where , f k n o d e = \u2211 i = 1 m V i ( d \u03c9 j d I i ) e l e m e n t \u2211 i = 1 m V i , w ( r i k ) = r min \u2212 r i k ( k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , M ) (2.12) r min = element size \u00d7 2 ( 1 \u2264 iteration < limit value_step ( 1 ) ) r min = element size \u00d7 2 ( limit value_step ( 1 ) \u2264 iteration < limit value_step ( 2 ) ) r min = element size \u00d7 2 2 ( limit value_step ( 2 ) \u2264 iteration < limit value_step ( 3 ) ) where m is the total number of elements connected to the k -th node, M is the total number of nodes included in the circular sub-domain, and w ( r i k ) is the weight factor for the distance from the center of the i -th element to the k -th node. V i is the volume of an individual element. The procedure for topology optimization based on the ABCA is as follows. 1. Determine a design domain and the topology optimization parameter, limit value. 2. Calculate the natural frequency for the initial design domain using finite element analysis. 3. Perform the employed bee phase: search for new some candidate positions determined by comparing the fitness values corresponding to \u03bd i j , z i j , and z k j . 4. Perform the onlooker bee phase: search for new some candidate positions satisfying the condition, rand [ 0 , 1 ] < p i , for each element by comparing the fitness values corresponding to \u03bd i j \u2032 , z i j \u2032 , and z k j \u2032 . 5. Perform the scout bee phase: Check the convergence criterion at the present iteration. If the iteration number is equal to the limit value and the convergence criterion is not satisfied, then the direct normalizing scheme of Eq. (2.11c) and changing filtering size scheme of Eq. (2.12) are performed. Otherwise, scout bee phase is performed by the simple averaging and changing filtering size schemes. 6. Determine a candidate solution (layout) from the candidate positions stored in employed and onlooker bee phases using a prescribed volume constraint. 7. Calculate the natural frequency for the updated topology using finite element analysis. 8. Verify whether or not the updated topology converges to an optimal topology using the following convergence criterion [11]: (2.13) error = | \u2211 i = 1 N \u2032 ( \u03c9 j ( k \u2212 i + 1 ) \u2212 \u03c9 j ( k \u2212 N \u2032 \u2212 i + 1 ) ) | \u2211 i = 1 N \u2032 \u03c9 j ( k \u2212 i + 1 ) \u2264 \u03c4 where \u03c9 j is the j -th natural frequency of the obtained topology, \u03c4 is allowable convergence error, and k is the present iteration number. N \u2032 is the integral number that results in a stable natural frequency in at least ten successive iterations. 9. If the updated topology has not converged to an optimal topology, update the amount of information for each element and the fitness values using Eqs. (2.4) and (2.8b), respectively, and then go to step 3. Repeat the above steps until the optimal topology is obtained. A schematic diagram of frequency optimization using the ABCA for topology optimization is shown in Fig. 2 . 3 Numerical examples In this section, three examples are presented to verify the capability and efficiency of the modified ABCA in topology optimization for dynamic problems comparing with the soft-kill BESO algorithm. The examples are all two-dimensional plane stress problems. The element used here is four-node linear element. And design domain is divided into fine elements in order to obtain a better solution. Since the effect of noise cleaning in the results was observed, a filter scheme was implemented. 3.1 A short beam with the first natural frequency The beam with dimensions 5 m \u00d7 1 m is clamped on both sides as shown in Fig. 3 . The material is assumed with Young\u2019s modulus E = 10 MPa , Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd = 0.3 and mass density \u03c1 = 1 kg/m 3 . The design domain 5 m \u00d7 1 m is equally divided into 200\u00d740 four node linear elements. The objective is to obtain a structure having the highest first natural frequency with volume constraint 90% of the original volume. The filter radius r min = 1.5 and penalty factor p = 3 are used in calculating sensitivity numbers. Fig. 4 shows optimal topologies corresponding to some iterations as well as evolution history of the first natural frequency of the short beam in the soft-kill BESO and the modified ABCA algorithms. Fig. 5 shows the optimal topologies obtained from the two algorithms. The optimal topologies are very close to each other. The first natural frequency of the initial design domain was 0.8339 Hz. The first natural frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the ABCA algorithm is obtained as 0.9121 Hz, whereas the first natural frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the soft-kill BESO algorithm is obtained as 0.9156 Hz. That is, the ratios of the first natural frequency increment for the ABCA and soft-kill BESO algorithms are 9.37% and 9.79%, respectively. In this example, the first natural frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the ABCA algorithm shows a little bit lower than that from the soft-kill BESO algorithm. It is found that the convergence rate of the ABCA algorithm is faster than the soft-kill BESO algorithm. It is also known that the optimal topology of the ABCA algorithm is almost obtained in the initial stage of topology optimization because of the characteristics of the ABCA algorithm. 3.2 A short beam with the second natural frequency The beam with dimensions 5 m \u00d7 1 m is clamped on both sides as shown in Fig. 3. The material is assumed with Young\u2019s modulus E = 10 MPa , Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd = 0.3 and mass density \u03c1 = 1 kg/m 3 . The design domain 5 m \u00d7 1 m is equally divided into 200\u00d740 four node linear elements. The objective is to obtain a structure having the highest second natural frequency with volume constraint 90% of the original volume. The filter radius r min = 1.5 and penalty factor p = 3 are used in calculating sensitivity numbers. Fig. 6 shows optimal topologies corresponding to some iterations as well as evolution history of the second natural frequency of the short beam in the soft-kill BESO and the ABCA algorithms. Fig. 7 shows the optimal topologies obtained from the two algorithms. The optimal topologies are obtained very similarly. The second natural frequency of the initial design domain is 1.9164 Hz. The second natural frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the ABCA algorithm is obtained as 2.0640 Hz. Also, the second natural frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the soft-kill BESO algorithm is obtained as 2.0640 Hz. That is, the ratios of the second natural frequency increment for the ABCA and soft-kill BESO algorithms are exactly the same as 7.7%. And, despite of the large volume fraction constraint, it is found that the convergence rate of the ABCA algorithm is a little bit faster than the soft-kill BESO algorithm. It is also known that the optimal topology of the ABCA algorithm is almost obtained in the initial stage of topology optimization because of the characteristics of the ABCA algorithm. 3.3 A rectangular plate Fig. 8 shows an aluminum plate of dimensions 0.15 m \u00d7 0.1 m . The plate is fixed at two corners on its diagonal. Only in-plane vibration is considered here. The material is assumed with Young\u2019s modulus E = 10 MPa , Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd = 0.3 , mass density \u03c1 = 1 kg/m 3 . The design domain 0.15 m \u00d7 0.1 m is equally divided into 90\u00d760 four node linear elements. The objective is to obtain a structure having the highest natural frequency with volume constraint 50% of the original volume. The filter radius r min = 1.5 and penalty factor p = 3 are used in calculating sensitivity numbers. Fig. 9 shows optimal topologies corresponding to some iterations as well as evolution history of the first natural frequency of the rectangular plate in the soft-kill BESO and the ABCA algorithms. Fig. 10 shows the optimal topologies obtained from the two algorithms. The optimal topologies are obtained very similarly. The first natural frequency of the initial design domain is 0.7560 Hz. The first natural frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the ABCA algorithm is obtained as 1.0480 Hz, whereas the first natural frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the soft-kill BESO algorithm is obtained as 1.0491 Hz. That is, the ratios of the first natural frequency increment for the ABCA and soft-kill BESO algorithms are 38.62% and 38.76%, respectively. In this example, the first frequency of the optimal topology obtained from the ABCA algorithm is obtained almost the same as that from the soft-kill BESO algorithm. It is also found that the convergence rate of the ABCA algorithm is very faster than the soft-kill BESO algorithm because of the small volume fraction constraint. And the optimal topology of the ABCA algorithm is almost obtained in the early stage of topology optimization because of the characteristics of the ABCA algorithm as the previous examples. 4 Conclusions As one of the stochastic methods, the ABCA algorithm is applied for topology optimization for dynamic problems in this research. From the results of the presented examples, the following can be concluded. (1) It is found that the suggested algorithm based on the ABCA can be applied for frequency topology optimization as a robust and stable algorithm. (2) It is verified that the ABCA algorithm is very effective and applicable in topology optimization for dynamic problems comparing with the results of the soft-kill BESO algorithm. (3) The convergence rate of the ABCA algorithm is very fast in the case of a small volume fraction constraint. The optimal topology of the ABCA algorithm is almost obtained in the initial or early stage of topology optimization because of the characteristics of the ABCA algorithm. References [1] H. Lazarus T.

The research progress of swarm robotics is reviewed in details. The swarm robotics inspired from nature is a combination of swarm intelligence and robotics, which shows a great potential in several aspects. First of all, the cooperation of nature swarm and swarm intelligence are briefly introduced, and the special features of the swarm robotics are summarized compared to a single robot and other multi-individual systems. Then the modeling methods for swarm robotics are described, followed by a list of several widely used swarm robotics entity projects and simulation platforms. Finally, as a main part of this paper, the current research on the swarm robotic algorithms are presented in detail, including cooperative control mechanisms in swarm robotics for flocking, navigating and searching applications. Keywords Swarm robotics Cooperative control Modeling Simulation Swarm intelligence 1 From nature swarm to swarm intelligence 1.1 Cooperation of nature swarms Most swarm intelligence researches are inspired from how the nature swarms, such as social insects, fishes or mammals, interact with each other in the swarm in real life [1]. These swarms range in size from a few individuals living in the small natural areas to highly organized colonies that may occupy the large territories and consist of more than millions of individuals. The group behaviors emerging in the swarms show great flexibility and robustness [2], such as path planning [3], nest constructing [4], task allocation [5] and many other complex collective behaviors in various nature swarm [6\u20138]. The individuals in the nature swarm shows very poor abilities, yet the complex group behaviors can emerge in the whole swarm, such as migrating of bird crowds and fish schools, and foraging of ant and bee colonies as shown in Fig. 1 . It's tough for an individual to complete the task itself, even a human being without certain experiences finds it difficultly, but a swarm of animals can handle it easily. Researchers have observed the intelligent group behaviors emerging from a group of individuals with poor abilities through local communication and information transmission. 1.1.1 Bacteria colonies Bacteria often function as multicellular aggregates known as biofilms, exchanging the molecular signals for inter-cell communication [9]. The communal benefits of multicellular cooperation include a cellular division of labor, collectively defending against antagonists, accessing more resources and optimizing the population survival by differentiating the distinct cell types. The resistance to antibacterial agents of the bacteria in the biofilms is 500 times more than that of individual bacteria of same kind [10]. 1.1.2 Fish schools Fish schools swim in the disciplined phalanxes and are able to stream up and down at impressive speeds and make a startling change in the shape of the school without collision as if their motions were choreographed. The fishes pay close attention to their neighbors when schooling with the help of eyes on the sides of heads and \u201cschooling marks\u201d on their shoulders [11]. The fishes can benefit from fish schools in foraging [12] and predator avoidance [13]. 1.1.3 Ant and Bee colonies Ants communicate with each other using pheromone, sound, and touch [14]. An ant with a successful attempt leaves a trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing the better routes and gradually identifying the best path [15]. Experiments in Ref. [16] suggest that the arts can choose the roles based on previous performance. The ants with higher successful rate intensify their foraging attempts while the others venture on fewer times or even change to other roles. 1.1.4 Locusts Buhl et al. [17] confirmed the prediction from theoretical physics that, as the density of animals in the group increases, the group rapidly transits from disordered movement of individuals to highly aligned collective movement. They also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion of that the groups can switch a direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information. 1.1.5 Bird crowds A long time ago, the human being has made use of birds' ability to precisely location home from more than 5000 km away. The birds gather into special formations during migration and locate the destinations with the aid of a variety of senses including sun compass, time calculation, magnetic fields, visual landmarks as well as olfactory cues [18]. 1.1.6 Primates The cooperation of primates can be complex, they can make the tools and use them to acquire food or interact socially, deception [19], recognize their kin and conspecifics [20] and learn to use the symbols and understand the aspects of human language. The primates also use vocalization, gestures, and facial expression to convey their psychological state. 1.1.7 Human beings Dyer et al. [21] has shown leadership and consensus decision making can occur without verbal communication or obvious signaling in a group of humans. They found that a small informed minority could guide a group of naive individuals to a target with improved time and accuracy efficiency. Even when conflicting directional information was given to different members, a consensus decision can be made efficiently. From the introduction above, it can be easily seen that, as the cooperation of the swarm increases, the group behaviors become more complex while the population size goes down and each individual plays a more important role in the behavior. It's difficult to imagine how such sophisticated abilities can emerge from the swarm consisting of such simple individuals with limited cognitive and communicating abilities. Nevertheless, in the most cases, a whole swarm of individuals do have the ability to solve many complex problems easily while a single individual of the same species cannot. Of course, in such organism without organizer, there still exist some mechanisms yet undiscovered which promise to divide the whole task into the small pieces for individuals to handle the outputs of agents and aggregates them into the collective behaviors [2]. The purpose of our research on swarm intelligence and swarm robotics is to explore such mechanisms for real-life applications [22]. 1.2 Swarm intelligence As an emerging research area, the swarm intelligence has attracted many researchers' attention since the concept was proposed in 1980s. It has now become an interdisciplinary frontier and focus of many disciplines including artificial intelligence, economics, sociology, biology, etc. It has been observed a long time ago that some species survive in the cruel nature taking the advantage of the power of swarms, rather than the wisdom of individuals. The individuals in such swarm are not highly intelligent, yet they complete the complex tasks through cooperation and division of labor and show high intelligence as a whole swarm which is highly self-organized and self-adaptive. Swarm intelligence is a soft bionic of the nature swarms, i.e. it simulates the social structures and interactions of the swarm rather than the structure of an individual in traditional artificial intelligence. The individuals can be regarded as agents with simple and single abilities. Some of them have the ability to evolve themselves when dealing with certain problems to make better compatibility [23]. A swarm intelligence system usually consists of a group of simple individuals autonomously controlled by a plain set of rules and local interactions. These individuals are not necessarily unwise, but are relatively simple compared to the global intelligence achieved through the system. Some intelligent behaviors never observed in a single individual will soon emerge when several individuals begin cooperate or compete. The swarm can complete the tasks that a complex individual can do while having high robustness and flexibility and low cost. Swarm intelligence takes the full advantage of the swarm without the need of centralized control and global model, and provides a great solution for large-scale sophisticated problems. 2 Definition and features 2.1 Definition of swarm robotics Swarm robotics is a new approach to the coordination of multi-robot systems which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots. It is supposed that a desired collective behavior emerges from the interaction between the robots and the interaction of robots with the environment. This approach emerged in the field of artificial swarm intelligence as well as the biological study of insects, ants and other fields in the nature, where a swarm behavior occurs. The research on the swarm robotics is to study the design of large amount of relatively simple robots, their physical body and their controlling behaviors. The individuals in the swarm are normally simple, small and low cost so as to take the advantage of a large population. A key component of the system is the communication between the agents in the group which is normally local, and guarantees the system to be scalable and robust. A plain set of rules at individual level can produce a large set of complex behaviors at the swarm level. The rules of controlling the individuals are abstracted from the cooperative behavior in the nature swarm. The swarm is distributed and de-centralized, and the system shows high efficiency, parallelism, scalability and robustness. The potential applications of swarm robotics include the tasks that demand the miniaturization, like distributed sensing tasks in micro machinery or the human body. On the other hand, the swarm robotics can be suited to the tasks that demand the cheap designs, such as mining task or agricultural foraging task. The swarm robotics can be also involved in the tasks that require large space and time cost, and are dangerous to the human being or the robots themselves, such as post-disaster relief, target searching, military applications, etc. 2.2 Characteristics of nature swarms Since the swarm robotics is mostly inspired from the nature swarms, it's a good reference for analyzing the characteristics of nature swarms. The research of swarm robotics started a century ago. The first hypothesis is quite personified [24] and assumes that each individual has a unique ID for cooperation and communication. The information exchange in the swarm is regarded as a centralized network. The queens in ant and bee colonies are supposed to be responsible for transmitting and assigning the information to each agent [25]. However, Jha, et al. [26] proved that the network in the swarm is decentralized. Thanks to the research in recent half century, the biologists can now assert that there are no unique IDs or other globally storage information in the network. No single agent can access to all the information in the network and a pacemaker is therefore inexistent. The biologists now believe that the social swarms are organized as a decentralized system distributed in the whole environment which can be described through a probabilistic model [27]. The agents in the swarm follow their own rules according to local information. The group behaviors emerge from these local rules which affect information exchange and topology structure in the swarm. The rules are also the key component to keep the whole structure to be flexible and robust even when the sophisticated behaviors are emerged. 2.3 Advantages of swarm robotics The advantages and characteristics of the swarm robotics system are presented by comparing a single robot and other similar systems with multiple individuals. These characteristics are quite similar to that of nature swarm. 2.3.1 Comparing with a single robot To complete a sophisticated task, a single robot must be designed with complicated structure and control modules resulting in high cost of design, construction and maintenance. Single robot is vulnerable especially when a small broken part of the robot may affect the whole system and it's difficult to predict what will happen. The swarm robotics can achieve the same ability through inter-group cooperation and takes the advantage of reusability of the simple agents and the low cost of construction and maintenance. The swarm robotics also takes the advantage of high parallelism and is especially suitable for large scale tasks. A single robot is inspired from human behaviors by comparing the corresponding nature species of these researching areas, while the swarm robotics is inspired from the social animals. Due to the restriction of current technology, it's hard to simulate the human interactions using machines or computers while the mechanisms in animal groups are easier to apply. This gives the swarm robotics a bright future in dealing with complex and large scale problems. The advantages of swarm robotics are described below. 2.3.1.1 Parallel The population size of swarm robotics is usually quite large, and it can deal with multiple targets in one task. This indicates that the swarm can perform the tasks involving multiple targets distributed in a vast range in the environment, and the search of the swarm would save time significantly. 2.3.1.2 Scalable The interaction in the swarm is local, allowing the individuals to join or quit the task at any time without interrupting the whole swarm. The swarm can adapt to the change in population through implicit task re-allocating schemes without the need of any external operation. This also indicates that the system is adaptable for different sizes of population without any modification of the software or hardware which is very useful for real-life application. 2.3.1.3 Stable Similar to scalability, the swarm robotics systems are not affected greatly even when part of the swarm quits due to the majeure factors. The swarm can still work towards the objective of the task although their performances may degrade inevitably with fewer robots. This feature is especially useful for the tasks in a dangerous environment. 2.3.1.4 Economical As mentioned above, the cost of swarm robotics is significantly low in designing, manufacturing and daily maintaining. The whole system is cheaper than a complex single robot even, if hundreds or thousands of robots exist in a swarm. Since the individuals in the swarm can be massively produced while a single robot requires precision machining. 2.3.1.5 Energy efficient Since the individuals in the swarm are much smaller and simpler than a giant robot, the energy cost is far beyond the cost of a single robot compared with the battery size. This means that the life time of the swarm is enlarged. In an environment without fueling facilities or where wired electricity is forbidden, the swarm robotics can be much useful than traditional single robot. In conclusion, the swarm robotics can be applied to sophisticated problems involving large amount of time, space or targets, and a certain danger may exist in the environment. The typical applications are as follows: UAV controlling, post-disaster relief, mining, geological survey, military applications and cooperative transportation. The swarm robotics can complete these tasks through cooperative behavior emerged from the individuals while a single robot can barely adapt to such situation. This is the reason why the swarm robotics has become an important research field in last decade. 2.3.2 Different from other multi-agent systems There exist several research areas inspired from the nature swarm, which are often confused with swarm robotics, such as multi-agent system and sensor network. These research areas also utilize the cooperative behavior emerged from the multiple agents in the group for specialized tasks. However, there are several differences between these systems, which can distinguish these systems fundamentally, as shown in Table 1 . From Table 1, it can be easily deduced that the main differences among swarm robotics and other systems are population, control, homogeneity and functional extension. Multi-agent and sensor network systems mainly focus on the behaviors of multiple static agents in the known environments while the robots in the multi-robot systems are quite small, usually heterogeneous and are externally controlled. Since homogeneity and scalability are considered at the beginning of the system design, the swarm robotics shows great flexibility and adaptability compared with other systems. The multi-robot systems usually involve the heterogeneous robots, and may achieve better performance on specialized tasks at the cost of flexibility, reusability and scalability. Besides scalability which is introduced in previous section, the characteristics of swarm robotics among other three cooperative systems are listed in Table 1. 2.3.2.1 Autonomous The individuals in swarm robotics systems must be autonomous, i.e. capable of interacting and motioning in the environment. With these key functions, the cooperative mechanisms inspired from the nature swarms can be introduced into the swarm robotics. Although the systems, like sensor networks, are far different from the swarm robotics from such point of view, but the research on the area can indeed throw some lights on swarm robotics research. 2.3.2.2 Decentralization With a good set of cooperative rules, the individuals can complete the task without centralized controls which promises the scalability and flexibility of the swarm. At the same time, the swarm can benefit more in the environments when communication is interrupted or lagged and improves the reaction speed and precision of the swarm. 2.3.2.3 Local sensing and communications Due to the restriction of hardware and cost, the robots in the swarm usually have a limited range of sensing and communicating and thus the whole swarm is distributed in the environment. Actually, the use of global communications will lead to a significant decline in scalability and flexibility, as the communication cost is explode exponentially as the population grows. Nevertheless, certain controlling global communications are acceptable, for instance, updating the controlling strategies or sending the terminal signals, so long as it's not used in the interaction between individuals. 2.3.2.4 Homogenous In a swarm robotics system, the robots should be divided into the roles as few as possible and the number of robots acting as each role should be as large as possible. The role here indicates the physical structure of the robot or other states that cannot be changed into one another dynamically during the task. A state in a finite state machine does not count in our definition. This definition indicates a swarm, no matter how large it is, is not considered as swarm robotics if the roles of robots are divided meticulously. For instance, the robots football usually is not considered as swarm robotics, since each individual in the team is assigned a special role during the game. 2.3.2.5 Flexibility A swarm with high flexibility can deal with different tasks with the same hardware and minor changes in the software, as the nature swarms can finish various tasks in the same swarm. The individuals in the swarm show different abilities and cooperation strategy when they deal with different tasks. The swarm robotics should provide such flexibility, especially in similar tasks, such as foraging, flocking or searching. The swarm can switch to different strategies according to the environment. The robots can adapt to the environment through machine learning from the past moves and can change to a better strategy. 2.4 Application scopes of swarm robotics The study of robotics application in target search has grown substantially in the recent years. It is more preferable for the dangerous or inaccessible working area. The problems involved in swarm robotics research can be classified into two classes. One class of the problems is mainly based on the patterns, such as aggregation, cartography, migration, self-organizing grids, deployment of distributed agents and area coverage. Another class of problems focuses on the entities in the environment, e.g. searching for the targets [28], detecting the odor sources [29], locating the ore veins in wild field [30], foraging, rescuing the victims in disaster areas [31] and etc. Besides these problems, the swarm robotics can also be involved into more sophisticated problems, mostly hybrid of these two classes, including cooperative transportation, demining [32], exploring a planet [33] and navigating in large area. Several potential application scopes [34] of swarm robotics which are very suitable are described below. 2.4.1 Tasks cover large area Swarm robotics system is distributed and specialized for the tasks requiring a large area of space, e.g. large coverage. The robots in the swarm are distributed in the environment and can detect the dynamic change of the entire area, such as chemical leaks or pollution. The swarm robotics can complete such tasks in a better way than sensor network since each robot can patrol in an area rather than stay still. This means that the swarm can monitor the area with fewer agents. Besides monitoring, the robots in the swarm can locate the source, move towards the area and take quick actions. In an urgent case, the robots can aggregate into a patch to block the source as a temporary solution. 2.4.2 Tasks dangerous to robot Thanks to the scalability and stability, the swarm provides redundancy for dealing with dangerous tasks. The swarm can suffer loss of robots to a great extent before the job has to be terminated. The robots are very cheap and are preferred for the areas which probably damage the workers. In some tasks, the robots may be irretrievable after the task, and the use of complex and expensive robots are thus economically unacceptable while the swarm robotics with cheap individuals can provide the reasonable solutions. For example, Murphy et al. [35] summarized the usage of robotics in mine rescue and recovery. They pointed out that although several applications already in use, the robots are beyond the requirement to show a desired performance in the tough environment under the ground. They proposed 33 requirements for the robots so as to achieve an acceptable behavior. 2.4.3 Tasks require scaling population Workload of some tasks may change over time, and the swarm size should be scaled based upon the current workload for high efficiency in both time and economics. For example, in the task of clearing oil leakage after tank accidents, the swarm should maintain a high population when the oil leaks fast at the beginning of the task and gradually reduce the robots when the leak source is plugged and the leaking area is almost cleared. The swarm also scales among different regions if the progress of these regions becomes unbalanced. Stormont [28] described the potential for using the swarms of autonomous robots to react a disaster site in the first 24 h. He summarized the swarm that can search for the victims with the highest probability of finding survivors, and made some suggestions for future research in this area. 2.4.4 Tasks require redundancy Robustness in the swarm robotics systems mainly benefits from the redundancy of the swarm, i.e. removing some robots does not have a significant impact on the performance. Some tasks focus on the result rather than the process, i.e. the system should make sure that the task will be completed successfully, mostly in the way of increasing redundancy. 2.4.5 Swarm robotics system in real life In the recent years, the researchers have already utilized the swarm robotics in several real-life applications including most of the tasks mentioned above. William et al. proposed a framework, called Physicomimetics, for the distributed control of swarms [36]. They focused on the robotic behaviors that are similar to those shown by solids, liquids, and gases. The different formations are adopted for the different tasks, including distributed sensing, obstacle avoidance, surveillance and sweeping. Correll [37] proposed a swarm-intelligent inspection system to inspect of blades in a jet turbine. The system is based on a swarm of autonomous, miniature robots, using only on-board, local sensors. MIT's Senseable City Lab developed a fleet of low-cost oil absorbing robots called Seaswarm [38] for ocean-skimming and oil removal. A nanomaterial robot can absorb oil up to 20 times of its weight. The system provides an autonomous and low cost solution for ocean environment protection. Roombots [39] is a novel self-reconfiguring modular robotic system. The autonomous modular robots can alter its shape to adapt to a given task and working environment, such as self-assembly and reconfiguration of static objects like furniture in the day-to-day environment. Formica [40] is a scalable, biologically-inspired swarm robotics platform. Its novel mechanical design permits production on standard circuit board assembly lines. The system takes the advantage of small cheap, long-life robots, supports the peripherals, and can be scaled to a population with several hundred individuals. Scientists believe such swarms are suitable solutions for the tasks like Mars reconnaissance, earthquake recovery, etc. Swarm robotics can be useful for military application as well. Pettinaro et al. [41] proposed a self-reconfigurable robot system for foraging, searching and rescuing, which has the ability to cope with occasional failure. Military experts believe that the bionic aero vehicles inspired from swarm intelligence technology will become applicable in a few years. It can be foreseen that machine bees or cockroaches with reconnaissance equipment and bombs will possibly show up in future war. 3 Modeling swarm robotics 3.1 General model of swarm robotics Swarm robotics model is a key component of cooperative algorithm that controls the behaviors and interactions of all individuals. In the model, the robots in the swarm should have some basic functions, such as sensing, communicating, motioning, etc. The model is divided into three modules based on the functions which the module utilizes to accomplish certain behaviors: information exchange, basic and advanced behavior. The information exchange among three modules plays the most important role in the model. The Robots in the swarm exchange the information with each other and propagate the information to the whole swarm through autonomous behaviors resulting in the swarm-level cooperation. General model of swarm robotics is shown in Fig. 2 . The robots communicate with each other. In some cases, the global positioning or central commands are introduced, but the swarm should still be able to complete the task if global communication is blocked. 3.1.1 Information exchange module Information exchange is inevitable when the robots cooperate with one another, and is the core part for controlling swarm behaviors. The main functions of individuals involved in this module are limited sensing and local communication. Information exchange of a robot falls into two categories: interaction with robot or environment. The strategies can be either same or different for the swarm due to different applications. In the nature swarms, the individuals can have the direct interaction, such as tentacle, gesture or voice. However, the indirect interactions are far more subtle. The individuals sense the information in the environment, react and leave the messages back to the environment. Environment act as the sticky notes, and the pheromones are the most common pencils in wild [42]. Such mechanism with positive feedback can optimize the robot-level behaviors, and the swarm-level behaviors can finally emerge [43]. There are three ways of information sharing in the swarm [44]: direct communication, communication through environment and sensing. More than one type of interaction can be used in one swarm, for instance, each robot senses the environment and communicates with their neighbor. Balch [45] discussed the influences of three types of communications on the swarm performance. He designed three tasks and compared the performance in simulation. Some researchers also discussed the possibility of swarm cooperating without communications; however, communication and sensing can indeed improve the efficiency of swarm for most applications. 3.1.1.1 Direct communication Direct communication is similar to wireless network and also consists of two types: peer-to-peer and broadcast. Thanks to the development in mobile devices, several existing technologies can be adopted immediately. Hawick et al. [46] proposed a physical architecture for a swarm of tri-wheel robots using both IEEE802.11b wireless Ethernet and Bluetooth. However, the wireless sensors cost almost half of a total robot. Another disadvantage of such scheme is that the bandwidth required will go into an exponential explosion as the population grows. In this way, the direct communication in the swarm should be limited. Although several existing wireless technologies are available, the protocols and topologies that are specialized for swarm robotics remain undiscovered. The existing computer networks are designed for data processing and information sharing between the nodes. Communications in swarm robotics should take the full advantage of local sensing and motioning abilities while pay special attention to boost the cooperative behaviors of individuals and dynamic topologies of the swarm [47]. 3.1.1.2 Communication through environment Environment can act as an intermediary for robots' interaction. The robots leave their traces in the environment after one action to stimulate other robots which can sense the trace, without direct communication among individuals. In this way, the subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of swarm-level activities. The swarm is imitated as ants or bees and interacts with the help of virtual pheromones. Such interactive scheme is exempted from the exponential explosion of the population but has some limitation on the environment to support the pheromones. Ranjbar-Sahraei et al. [48] implemented a coverage approach using the markers in the environment without direct communication. Payton et al. [49] proposed a swarm robotics using the biologically inspired notion of \u2018virtual pheromone\u2019 for distributed computing mesh embedded in the environment. The virtual pheromones are propagated in the swarm other than the environment. Grushin and Reggia [50] solved a problem of self-assembly of pre-specified 3D structures from the blocks of different sizes with a swarm of robotics using stigmergy. 3.1.1.3 Sensing The individuals can sense the robots and environment nearby using on-board sensors if they can distinguish the robots and other objects from the environment. The robots sense the objects or targets in the environment and accomplish the tasks like obstacle avoidance, target search, flocking, etc. The main issue of this scheme is how to integrate all the sensors in the swarm efficiently for cooperation. Cortes et al. [51] explored how to control and coordinate a group of autonomous vehicles, regarded as the agents with sensors, in an adaptive, distributed and asynchronous way. The main difference between communication and sensing is whether the individuals send out the messages actively or receive the messages passively. Although more precise and abundant communication requires more complex hardware and synchronization, the cost of bandwidth, energy and time will grow extremely fast as population grows. The cooperative model of swarm robotics should try to simplify the communication and use as much sensing as possible. Colors, luminance and relative positions can be used for sensing and can provide rich information without communication. In some tasks, the swarm can exchange all the information only with the sensors. 3.1.2 Basic behavior module Basic behaviors of individuals include functions such as motioning and local planning which is one of most significant differences of swarm robotics than the multi-agent and sensor network systems. The robots and their behavior controls are homogeneous and form the fundaments of group behaviors. Based on the input from communication or sensing, the robots compute their desired movements. With an excellent control module, the swarm can rely less on the communication with the help of prediction and more direct interactions, rather than broadcast. The swarm can improve the performance with less information exchange and high scalability. 3.1.3 Advanced behavior module Robots in complex swarm robotic systems may have the extra functions including but not limited to task decomposition, task allocation, adaptive learning, and etc [52]. The robots with these functions in hardware can simplify the design of the algorithm yet lead to a more complex physical design of real robot. The robots can also achieve the similar functions with carefully designed cooperative algorithms. The implement of such functions in hardware or software depends on the physical designs of the robots, controllers and sensors so as to make better use of the components [53]. Details of how robots cooperating with each other are presented in Section 3.3. Task allocation and learning are emphasized here as they are normally quite important to a swarm of robots. Task decomposition and allocation can greatly improve efficiency for especially complex tasks. Kalra and Martinoli [54] compared the costs and benefits of different types of task allocation approaches in noisy world. Learning is also useful since the parameters of the control mechanism are hard to be tuned. With the help of self-adaptive learning and optimizing methods, the swarm shows better adaptability in the different environments. Pugh and Martinoli [55] discussed the problem of using different learning methods in the swarm robotics and compared their performance in simulation. Zhang et al. [56] applied an evolutionary neural network to evolve the swarm robotics controllers and used their method in the structure inspection problem. 3.2 Modeling methods for swarm robotics Modeling is a method used in many research fields to better understand the internals of the system that is investigated. Modeling helps to the swarm robotics since a swarm robotic algorithm is supposed to be scalable to hundreds of thousands of robots in population. The time and money are limited for such scale of experiments, the experiments can be done in an easier way. Considering the characteristics of swarm robotics, the modeling methods are divided into four types according to Ref. [57]: sensor-based, microscopic, macroscopic and swarm intelligence-based. The four methods are described in detail in this section. 3.2.1 Sensor-based modeling In the sensor-based modeling method, the sensors and actuators of the robots are modeled as the main components of the system along with the objects in the environment. Then the interactions of the robots are modeled as realistically and simply as possible. This modeling method is mostly used, and the oldest method is used for robotic experiment. The earlier research using sensor-based modeling methods [58,59] did not consider the real physical limitations, now the researchers introduce the physical principle into the model [60,61]. 3.2.2 Microscopic modeling In the microscopic modeling, the robots and interactions are modeled as a finite state machine. The behaviors of each robot are defined as several states, and the transfer conditions are based on the input from communication and sensing. Since the model is based on the behaviors of each robot, the simulation should be run for several times to obtain the averaged behaviors of the swarm. In the most swarm robotics research, the probabilistic microscopic model is used, since noise can be modeled as probability in the model. In a probabilistic microscopic model [62], the probabilities are valued from the experiments of real robots, and the model is iterated with these probabilities for state transfer in the simulation to predict the behavior of the swarm. 3.2.3 Macroscopic modeling Macroscopic modeling is a modeling method opposite to the microscopic modeling. In the macroscopic modeling, the system behavior is defined as difference equation, and a system state represents the average number of robots in this state at the time step. The main difference between microscopic and macroscopic models is the granularity of the models. The microscopic model for the behavior at individual level is used to simulate the group behaviors while the macroscopic model simulates the behaviors at the swarm level. The microscopic model iterates the swarm behavior, and the macroscopic model can give out the final state of the swarm. In this way, the macroscopic model can have a global glance at the swarm while the microscopic model can show the details of the swarm behaviors [63]. Probabilistic macroscopic models are also widely used by the researchers. Martinoli et al. [64] applied the macroscopic modeling to stick the pulling problem from a basic model which contains only two states up to the model with all states. They also compared the microscopic, macroscopic and sensor-based models and described the shortages of macroscopic model. 3.2.4 Modeling from swarm intelligence algorithms Cooperative schemes from swarm intelligence algorithms have been introduced into the swarm robotics in many researches. Since the robots use the same or similar schemes with these algorithms, the models and other methods used to analyze these algorithms, which are quite mature than that in swarm robotics, can be used directly for robot research. The most commonly used algorithm from swarm intelligence is the particle swarm optimization (PSO) which mimics the flocking process of the birds. The particles fly in the field and search for the best. It can be found obviously that many commons remain between PSO and swarm robotics. A mapping between particle and robot can be presented easily [65]. Besides PSO, the researchers also introduce other swarm intelligence algorithms into swarm robotics. Many successful swarm models were inspired from the ant colonies. These inspired approaches provide an effective heuristics for searching in dynamic environment [66] and routing [67]. Many other algorithms are summarized in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. However, there are still many problems when a cooperative scheme from swarm intelligence is introduced. The schemes in these algorithms consider the most global interactions and introduce large amount of random moves for high diversity. Some schemes also contain the operations to reset the positions of searching agents. However, these operations are unavailable for swarm robotics. How can the schemes in swarm robotics avoid such operations while taking full advantage of the scalability and flexibility is a future research direction. 3.3 Cooperation schemes between robots Cooperation belongs to the advanced behavior in the swarm robotics model. In swarm robotics, cooperation occurs at two levels: individual level and swarm level. The former is must for robot's activities and coordinates the inputs from environment with the response, learning and adapting behaviors. The latter is an aggregation of former cooperation, resulting in the typical collective tasks such as gather, disperse or formation. Several sub-problems have been proposed for cooperation between robots which are described in detail in this section. The schemes introduced in this section are focused on the physical layer of the robot. The cooperation schemes at algorithm level are summarized in Section 5 which introduces the swarm robotic algorithms. 3.3.1 Architecture of swarm The architecture of the swarm is a framework for robotic activities and interactions and determines the topology for information exchange among robots. The swarm performance in cooperation depends largely on the architecture. The architecture of the swarm should be selected carefully according to the scale, relations and cooperation of the robots [52]. 3.3.2 Locating Global coordinating systems do not exist in the swarm. Therefore, each robot in the swarm has to maintain a local coordinating system and should be able to distinguish, identify and locate the nearby robots. Thus, a method for rapidly locating other robots using on-board sensors is very important for swarm robotics [68]. The absolute positioning technologies from single robots have been applied in some researches [69], and the combination of sensors with special filters has been adopted [70,71]. The sensors can sense different waves, including ultrasonic, visible light, infrared ray or sound [72]. However, the relative positioning of swarm robotics are more realistic since the abilities of the robots are limited and no global controls exist. Therefore a light weighted relative positioning algorithm need to be found. Pugh and Martinoli [73] characterized and improved an existing infrared relative localization module used to find the range and bearing between the robots in small scale swarm robotics system. Kelly and Martinoli [74] developed an on-board localization system using infrared sensors for indoor applications. A three dimensional relative positioning sensor for indoor flying robots was proposed by Roberts et al. [75], designed to enable the spatial coordination and goal-directed flight of inter-robot. 3.3.3 Physical connections Physical connections are used in the situations that single robot can overcome, such as overpassing large gaps or cooperative transportation. In these tasks, the robots should communicate and dock before they continue to execute their tasks. Mondada et al. [76] introduced several types of physical connections, sensors and actuators for overcoming the gaps and stairs. Wang and Liu [77] developed a localizing and docking method using infrared ray. Zhang et al. [78] proposed a reconfigurable robot with limited structures and fixed number of modules for urban search and rescue. Nouyan and Dorigo [79] solved the exploration and navigation tasks in an unknown environment using chained robots. The dynamics and qualities of the chain formation process are evaluated in simulation. 3.3.4 Self-organization and self-assembly Self-organization is a dynamic scheme for building a global structure through only local interactions of the basic units. The basic units or robots do not share a global control or have an external commander. The swarm level structure emerges from the individual level. A robot interacts with the others through the structures already built, i.e. behaviors of robots are guided by process of the building. Such schemes can be easily found in the nature, as ant or bee colonies building the nests. Self-organization can be conducted by the biological study on these animal behaviors. During the process of nest building, the ants can interact with the environment in two ways: discrete or continuous. The discrete interaction reacts to the type of stimulation while the continuous interaction reacts to the amount of stimulation. A model utilizing the discrete interaction has been proposed: the position a unit to be arranged is decided by the structure nearby. Simulation shows the model can result in a structure very similar to bee cave [80]. Self-assembly system can be inspired from the bee cave construction model. The behaviors in the swarm are conducted by the existing structures and prior knowledge. Payton et al. [81] used the pheromones to enhance such schemes. The swarm starts with random behaviors and converges to a pattern. As an example, the swarm-bots Project [47] introduced in Section 4.1.3 is a self-organization and self-assembly system. Each robot has multiple connector port, so that the swarm can aggregate into a large structure. 4 Entity projects and simulations 4.1 Swarm robotics entity projects In recent years, the swarm robotics has become a research topic in which the Chinese researchers have an interest, yet most of these are quite simple and only are simulated in the computer [82]. The Project SI [83] is a relatively complete project of real robots. In the early 1980s, the researchers from Europe and USA have begun to research on developing a group of mobile robots. Some earlier projects include CEBOT [84], SWARMS [85], ACTRESS [86], etc. However, these projects are quite preliminary. As the research on swarm robotics has gone deeper in computer simulation, the entity projects have also been boosted. Nowadays, there are several projects that provide the designs of a swarm of robots which will be briefly summarized in this Section. 4.1.1 Project SI Project SI [87] was developed by the Embedded Lab of Shanghai Jiaotong University. The project consists of a swarm of mobile robots, named eMouse, controlled by the swarm inspired algorithms. The robots are designed to be reconfigurable in sensors and communication protocols, cheap in cost and strong in motion control. The eMouse does not contain the sensors when the interfaces are designed but left for connecting the different sensors for various applications. The project team has completed the design of the fifth generation of robot and implemented several cooperative algorithms on the system. They implemented several primitives [88], including clump, disperse, generalized disperse, attract, swarm, scan and message transmission. Based on a set of testing tools, for instance, monitoring through trace extraction and live update over wireless network, they solved the real life applications inspired from swarm intelligence. 4.1.2 Sambots Sambots is a project for a swarm of self-assembly robots [89]. Multiple Sambots can form new structures through self-assembly and self-reconfiguration. The team realized the robots by the innovative design of docking mechanism and the reasonable distribution of the perception system [90]. The docking mechanism is installed on an active docking interface, which can rotate around the main body of the robot. With such scheme, the robots can connect with others robots freely to form a chained structure. Sambots can compose several structures through different configurations, including snake, caterpillar, ring, triangle, six-limbed insects, etc. 4.1.3 Swarm-bots project Swarm-bots [47], sponsored by the Future and Emerging Technologies program of the European Commission, is a project for exploring the design, implementation and simulation of self-organizing and self-assembling artifacts. The project, lasting 42 months, was successfully completed on March 31, 2005. The main scientific objective of the Swarm-bots project is to explore a new approach to the design and implementation of self-organizing and self-assembling artifacts. The aim of the team is to construct a large swarm-bot using a number of simpler, insect-like, robots(s-bots) with relatively cheap components and capable of self-assembling and self-organizing to adapt to its environment. The project developed both simulation and entity robots and presented their results on the two platforms. 4.1.4 Swarmanoid project Since October 1, 2006, the Swarmanoid project has extended the work done in the Swarm-bots project to three dimensional environment. The team introduced three types of small insect robots: eye-bot, hand-bot, and foot-bot, which differ from s-bots in previous project. Swarmanoid consists of a total number of 60 robots from the three types. The team has won the AAAI 2011 video competition. The eye-bots capable to fly or attach to the ceiling are designed to sense and analyze the environment from a high position to provide an overview. The foot-bots, previously named as s-bots, are able to move on rough terrain and transport either objects or other robots. The hand-bots climb the vertical surfaces of walls or objects and work in a space zone between those covered by the foot-bots (the ground) and eye-bots (the ceiling). With the combination of three types of robots, the swarm can handle those tasks that require operations in all dimensions. The team also developed the distributed control algorithms and communications as well as a simulation platform [91] for the project. 4.1.5 Pheromone robotics project The Pheromone Robotics Project [92], started in 2000, is coordinated by Professor David. The project aims to provide a robust, scalable approach for achieving the swarm level behaviors using a large number of small-scale robots in surveillance, reconnaissance, hazard detection, path finding, payload conveyance and small-scale actuation [81]. The team exploited the notion of a virtual pheromone, and implemented the simple beacons and directional sensors mounted on each robot. The virtual pheromones only facilitate simple communication and coordination with little on-board processing. 4.1.6 I-swarm project The I-swarm project [93], hosted by Professor Heinz from 2004, combines micro-robotics, distributed and adaptive systems as well as self-organizing biological swarm systems. The project facilitates the mass-production of micro-robots, which can then be used as a real swarm consisting of more than 100 micro-robot clients. These clients are all equipped with limited sensors and intelligence, each with a size of less than 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 mm and velocity of 1.5 mm/s. With such tiny size, the swarm can work cooperatively in a small world (such as inside creatures) at very cheap cost. 4.1.7 iRobot swarm project iRobot Swarm Project [94] is projected by MIT for cooperating over 100 robots. The goal of the project is to develop the distributed algorithms for robotic swarms composed of hundreds of individual robots robust to complex real-world environment and tolerant to the addition or failure of any number of individuals. The project team has developed a global monitoring device and an automatic charging station. The most of work of the project was done by Mclurkin and his colleagues [95]. 4.1.8 E-puck education robot The main goal of this project is to develop a miniature mobile robot for education use. The robots have several features specialized for such purpose. The robots have a clean mechanical structure simple to understand, operate and maintain. The robots are cheap and flexible, and can cover a large spectrum of educational activities thanks to a large potential in sensors, processing power and extensions [96]. Researches based on e-puck project have already exceeded 60 by the end of 2010. The potential educational fields include mobile robotics, real-time programming, embedded system, signal processing, image or sound feature extraction, human\u2013machine interaction or collective system. 4.1.9 Kobot project Kobot [97], conducted by Middle East Technical University, is a new mobile robot platform which is a specially designed a swarm robotics. The robots are equipped with an infrared-based short range sensing system for measuring the distance from obstacles to a novel sensing the relative headings of neighboring robots. 4.1.10 Kilobot project Kilobot project [98] aims to design a robot system for testing the collective algorithms with a population of hundreds or thousands of robots. Each robot is made of low-cost parts and takes 5 min to be fully assembled. The system also provides several overall operations for a large swarm, such as updating programs, powering on, charging all robots and returning home. 4.2 Simulation platforms The research on swarm robotic system requires a plenty of physical robots, making it hard to afford for many research institutions [99]. The computer simulation is developed to visually test the structures and algorithms on computer. Although the final aim of the research is real robots, it is often very useful to perform simulation prior to the investigation of real robots. Simulations are easier to setup, less expensive, normally faster and more convenient to use than physical swarms [100]. In this section, several widely used simulation platforms are summarized. 4.2.1 Player/stage The widely-used Player Project [101] is one of the most famous simulators and aims to produce free software for robot and sensor research. Player project is a robot server that provides full access and control of robotic platform, sensors and actuators for researchers. Stage [102] is a scalable simulator that is interfaced to Player and can simulate a population of 1000 mobile robots in a 2D bitmapped environment in parallel. Physics is simulated in a purely kinematic fashion, and noise is ignored in Stage. 4.2.2 Gazebo Gazebo [103] is a simulator that extends Stage for 3D outdoor environments. It generates the realistic sensor feedback and applies the ODE physic engine instead of the naive one in Stage. Gazebo presents a standard Player interface in addition to its own native interface. In this way, the controllers written for Stage can be used in Gazebo and vice-versa. 4.2.3 \u00dcberSim The \u00dcberSim [104] is a simulator developed at Carnegie Mellon for a rapid validation before uploading the program to real robot soccer scenarios. \u00dcberSim uses ODE physics engine for realistic motions and interactions. Although originally designed for Soccer robots, the custom robots and sensors can be written in C in the simulator and the program can be uploaded to the robots using TCP/IP. 4.2.4 USARSim USARSim [105], shorted for Urban Search and Rescue Simulation, is a high fidelity multi-robot simulator originally developed for search and rescue (SAR) research activities of the Robocup contest. It has now become one of the most complete general purpose tools for robotics research and education. It is built upon a widely used commercial game engine, Unreal Engine 2.0. The simulator takes full advantage of high accuracy physics, noise simulation and numerous geometrics and models from the engine. Evaluations have shown that USARSim can simulate the real time robots well enough for researchers due to the high fidelity physics engine. 4.2.5 Enki Enki [106] is an open source, fast 2D physics based robot simulator written in C++. It is able to simulate the cinematics, collision, sensors and cameras of robots working on a flat surface. Enki is able to simulate the robot swarms hundred times faster on the desktop computer than real-time robots. Enki is built to support several existing real robot systems, including swarm-bots and E-puck, while user can customize their own robots into the platform. 4.2.6 Webots Webots [100] is a development environment used to model, program and simulate the mobile robots available for more than 10 years. With Webots, the user can design the complex robotic setups, with one or several, similar or different robots with a large choice of pre-defined sensors and actuators. The objects in the environment can be customized by the user. Webots also provides a remote controller for testing the real robots. Until now, Webots robot simulator has been used in more than 1018 universities and research centers in the worldwide. 4.2.7 Breve Breve [107] is a simulation package designed for simulating large distributed artificial life systems in a continuous 3D world. Behaviors and interactions of agents are defined using Python. Breve uses ODE physics engine and OpenGL library that allows the observers to view the simulation in the 3D world from any position and direction. Users can interact at run time with the simulation using a web interface. Multiple simulations can interact and exchange individuals over the network. 4.2.8 V-REP V-REP [108] is an open resource 3D robot simulator that allows creating entire robotic systems, simulating and interacting with dedicated hardware. V-REP is based on a distributed control architecture: control programs (or scripts) can be directly attached to the objects in the scene and run simultaneously in both threaded and non-threaded fashions. This makes it very versatile and ideal for multi-robot application, and allows the users to model the robotic systems in a similar fashion as in reality where control is most of the time also distributed. V-REP possesses several calculation modules, such as sensor simulation (proximity or camera), inverse and forward kinematics, two physics engines (Bullet and ODE), path planning, minimum distance calculation, graphing, etc. 4.2.9 ARGoS ARGoS [109] is a new pluggable, multi-physics engine for simulating the massive heterogeneous swarm robotics in real time. Contrary to other simulators, every entity in ARGoS is described as a plug-in one and easy to implement and use. In this way, the multiple physics engines can be used in one experiment, and the robots can migrate from one to another in a transparent way. Results have shown that ARGoS can simulate about 10,000 wheeled robots with full dynamics in real-time. ARGoS is also able to be implemented in parallel in the simulation. 4.2.10 TeamBots TeamBots [110] is a collection of Java simulation for mobile robotics research. Some execution on mobile robots sometimes requires low-level libraries in C. TeamBots supports the prototyping, simulation and execution of multirobot control systems and is compatible with the Nomad 150 robot by Nomadic Technologies and Cye robot by Personal Robotics. 5 Cooperative algorithms Research on swarm robotics so far is still quite simple. Most of the algorithms are designed for every encountering application, but an algorithm with high usability has been undiscovered. A main reason for such situation is that there is still not a common and standard definition for swarm robotics system and application problems. The problems abstracted in swarm robotics research are in a wide variety with different problem definition and setups, and it's hard to provide a uniform description for all the problems. No benchmark test has yet been proposed. Therefore, different researching works can provide little experience to each other and these different algorithms cannot compare to each other easily. Thus the whole progress of swarm robotics research is still quite slow. 5.1 Earlier progress of swarm robotics algorithms In the earlier years of swarm intelligence research, the scientists simulated the cooperative mechanisms in the nature and explored the possibility of reproducing these swam behaviors in the artificial agents. Self-organizing clustering observed in bacteria was one of the first swarm behaviors reproduced by the scientists [111]. The individuals in the swarm are controlled by a simple rule: the possibility of joining or leaving a colony is conducted by the density nearby. In the experiment, 1500 individuals in the swarm gradually clustered into three colonies without any prior information or external control. A similar approach simulating ants' behavior of clearing up the graves was also proposed [112]. The task of the swarm is to collect all the items in the area together. There are no predefined storage spots available. Individual in the swarm follows a simple and local rule to transport an item from a spot of low density to high density only. Experiment shows that the swarm completes the task for collecting 80 items without communication. They also explored the how these rules can impact on the result. Another famous attempt for simulating the cooperating abilities in the early years is the stick pulling experiment [62]. In this experiment, the stick is too long for one robot to pull it out, i.e. two robots have to pull out the stick together. The aim of this test is to verify the swarm can emerge simple intelligence with simple rules even if no communication is available. The swarm can finish the task by the rule of that a robot waits for other robots for a random time before leaving for another stick. Dispersing uniformly in an indoor environment is one of the early algorithms that focus on the distributed structure of swarm robotics. McLurkin and Smith [96] proposed an algorithm for a swarm of iRobot. The algorithm is divided into two steps executed alternately: one disperses the robots and the other detects the border. In this way, the swarm can gradually expand in the environment. 5.2 Features of swarm robotics algorithm A swarm robotics algorithm must fit and make full use of the features of swarm robotics. The algorithm should explore the cooperation between robots and share some features with swarm robotics system. For example, Stirling et al. [113] studied a swarm of flying robots searching in an indoor environment containing rooms and corridors. They introduced a strategy that saves energy significantly, i.e. the robots move one by one while all other robots pin to the roof to save energy. However, the swarm is required to transit the whole environment with very poor time efficiency. Since only one robot is moving at a time, the cooperative advantage of the swarm can hardly bring into play. It is hard to be classified as swarm robots algorithm in this case. Five features of swarm robotics algorithm are specially emphasized in this section: simple, scalable, decentralized, local and parallel. 5.2.1 Simple Since the capability of each robot is limited, the algorithm should therefore be as easy as possible. A simple algorithm can help to reduce the cost of a single robot. Even complex and efficient swarm behaviors can emerge form a well-designed simple cooperative algorithm. In most cases, the robots are considered to be a finite state machine with only a few states. 5.2.2 Scalable The algorithm designed for swarm robotics must be scalable for any population size so that the system is a scalable one. In an algorithm, the designer should consider allowing the robots to join and especially quit the swarm dynamically. All the operations of the robots that interact with the whole swarm should be designed carefully so as not to affect the performance when a population is very large. 5.2.3 Decentralization The robots in a swarm are autonomous and so would the algorithm be. An algorithm should always avoid any external and centralized controls. Although an individual may be affected by others, it should make the decision on its own. A decentralized algorithm is quite possible to be scalable. 5.2.4 Local Local communication and local interaction are the special features of swarm robotics. The algorithm should also follow this rule as it is the key for scalability. Since the robots can simulate global communication and interaction system using local systems with specially designed scheme and some delay for the information to propagate in the swarm, direct use of global operations should be avoided. 5.2.5 Parallel The swarm usually consists of many robots. Therefore, the algorithms should be as parallel as possible so that the robots can deal with multiple targets in the same time, which is one of the advantages of the swarm robotics. According to these features, the scientists have proposed many swarm robotics algorithms. However, the research of swarm robotics is still at the start, and the main interests of the researchers are some basic tasks, such as formation control, obstacle avoidance and etc. A unified framework has yet not been proposed. As the research progress in future, several benchmark applications should be proposed and the algorithms will unleash various characteristics of the swarm robotics, such as scalable, robustness and flexibility. By that time, the researchers can focus more on the complicated problems consisting in these benchmark applications, resulting in more applicable algorithms for real life problems. 5.3 Fundamental tasks of swarm robotics In the past decades, the swarm robotics has been deployed in various scopes of applications [95], including odor localization, mobile sensor networking, medical operations, surveillance and search-and-rescue. The tasks of these applications are very sophisticated and hard to propose a direct solution. To solve these tasks, several basic tasks have been proposed by the swarm robotics researchers, such as flocking, navigating, obstacle avoidance, etc. Among these tasks, flocking is the most important and fundamental one. Apparently, coordinating a large number of robots at the swarm level with individual rules is not an easy task. Therefore, the emerging group behavior from interactions of robots with environment and other robots has been the main interest of the research since the area has been introduced. Flocking is widely observed in many nature swarms or even human beings. The creatures in the social groups show a great diversity in their population due to the differences in age, morphology, nutritional state, personality and leadership status of the individuals, thus it is surprised that they can achieve flocking with limited rules and interactions in such a blended group. The inspiring schemes from these groups can aid in developing the basic tasks of flocking, directed navigating, searching and obstacle avoidance. 5.3.1 Flocking strategy and formation The \u201cBoids\u201d model, proposed by Reynolds [114] in 1987, is a typical individual model for flocking behavior using distance metrics. The model has been widely adopted in various applications including spacecraft, UAV, robot, and etc. In these applications, the group behaviors cannot be explicitly defined at group level and the individual rules are adopted [115]. The most common use of the \u201cBoids\u201d model in swarm robotics flocking is in the form of virtual forces. Hettiarachchi and Spears [116] introduced a \u201cPhysicomimetics\u201d framework which controls the robots' behavior using physical forces virtually generated by the interactions. They employed two types of forces from the physic laws: Newtonian Force Law and Lennard-Jones Force Law, and the swarms showed quite similar results with the real material following these laws in their simulation. Moeslinger et al. [117] proposed a flocking behavior for robots which interprets all the interactions as attraction and repulsion forces only. The forces are decided by whether the distance falls in attraction and repulsion zones. With different setup of two zones, they achieved flocking for a small group in a constrained environment. Hashimoto et al. [118] proposed a control algorithm for a swarm of robots based on the gravity center of the local swarms which are overlapped partially to increase the stability of the whole swarm. Local forces such as attraction and repulsion are also applied to each robot to increase the stability of the local swarm and thus the entire swarm. Lawton et al. [119] presented a behavior-based approach to formation maneuvers. They decomposed complex formation maneuvers into a sequence of maneuvers between formation patterns. They presented three formation control strategies to deal with different topologies and purposes. Although most models in swarm robotics assume that the individuals interact with all their neighbors within certain distance, some biological researches provide a new idea. By reconstructing the three dimensional positions of a few thousands of birds during flocking, Ballerini et al. [120] showed that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, but rather on the topological distance with six to seven neighbors on average. Various computer simulations in computer also show that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one. Based on such observation, some researchers also proposed selecting strategies before interacting with nearby robots so that only a fixed number of neighbors are used. Lee and Chong [121] proposed a flocking control inspired from the fish schools. They selected two neighbors for team maintenance and local interactions. Ercan et al. [122] introduced a regular tetrahedron formation strategy for selecting three neighbors that forms the best tetrahedron to ensure formation. Miyagawa [123] has shown that the swarms can flock without distance information. He utilized a strategy inspired from tau-margin, assuming the animals especially birds perceive time to contact rather than distance. The robots in the swarm are equipped with light bulbs of 10W so as to perceive tau-margin by utilizing optical inverse square law. Barnes et al. [115] presented a method for organizing a swarm of unmanned vehicles into a user-defined formation by utilizing artificial potential fields generated from normal and sigmoid functions. The potential functions along with nonlinear limiting functions are used to control the shape of swarm to user desired geometry. 5.3.2 Directed flocking Besides the flocking strategy, the direction control in flocking is the most concern in flocking research and has been widely adopted in navigation, migration and searching applications. Until now, a large number of researches have been made on directing the swarm with target positions and propagating information in the swarm. 5.3.2.1 Informed individual A common and naive strategy of direct flocking is the \u201cinformed individual\u201d. It was first observed in nature swarms by Couzin and his colleagues [124], who conducted a study on effective leadership and decision-making in animal groups and published their work in Nature. In their experiment, only a few of the individuals in the group are aware of the target direction. The results demonstrate that these informed individual can lead the whole group towards the destination. Later, Correll, et al. [125] utilized such scheme in cow herd to guild the swarm. From then on, the similar schemes have been also introduced to swarm robotics. McLurkin [126] developed a strategy in his mater thesis for the task of following the leader with a linear formation. The robots line up in the topology, follow the predecessors and guide the successors. The leader is guided by other controls for the final destination of the group. The group forms the line without any external orders and can handle the obstacles in the environment and the communication failures that may encounter. Nasseri and Asadpour [127] investigated the controlling effects of a swarm with only a small fraction of robots having the knowledge of final goal. The informed robots cannot transmit information directly, yet the swarm can flock towards the desired target in simulation. They also investigated how the parameters can influence on the performance. A self-organized flocking behavior for a swarm of robots was presented by Turgut et al. [128] without using the emulated sensors or the priori knowledge of the destination. The simulation shows that, with only local interactions, the robots can share a common flocking direction in a self-organized process until the sensing noise exceeds to a certain extent. In their follow-up work [129], they studied how the swarm can be steered toward a desired direction by guiding some of individuals externally. The results are qualitative in accordance with the ones that were predicted using modal in Ref. [124] model. The two works were evaluated in both physical systems and simulations in an environment with obstacles. Stranieri [130] studied the self-organized flocking behaviors of two types of robots: aligning and non-aligning. An aligning robot has the ability to agree on a common heading direction with its neighbors. A heterogeneous swarm of these two kinds of robots can achieve good flocking performance in simulation if the motion control strategy and interact mechanisms are carefully designed. 5.3.2.2 Potential field functions Another commonly used swarm formation control strategy is the potential field function. Ge and Fua [131] presented a scalable and flexible approach to effectively control the formation of a group of robots. They introduced the artificial potential trenches and represented the formation structures in terms of queues and vertices, rather than with nodes. The robots are attracted to and move along the bottom of the potential trench and distribute with respect to the density nearby automatically. In their follow up work, Fua et al. [132] investigated the operation of the queue-formation structure with limited communication. Information interaction is classified as two scales: the fast-time and slow-time scale. The former scale involves only local real time communication, and in the latter scale, information is less demanding and can be collected over a longer time from the swarm. In this way, the swarm is incrementally guided into the specific formation in a more efficient manner. The aggregation, foraging, and formation control of robots were investigated by Gazi et al. [133], which are controlled by using artificial potential and sliding mode. They considered a significantly more realistic and more difficult setting with non-holonomic unicycle agent dynamics models compared with other studies. Blach and Hybinette [134] presented a new class of potential functions for navigating the swarm towards a goal location in obstacle environment. The approach is inspired by the same way that molecules \u201csnap\u201d into place as they form crystals and the swarm can arrange themselves in a geometric formation. 5.3.3 Positioning and navigation In flocking and migration, the positioning of goal, nearby robots and various obstacles in the fields is also an important task. In the application taking place in the large outdoor environment, the global positioning is expensive and requires more hardware, which is unaffordable for swarm robotics. Thus, the local positioning in flocking should be specially focused. 5.3.3.1 Navigation Rothermich et al. [135] developed a distributed localizing and mapping method based on a swarm of iRobots. Since the swarm does not share a global coordinating system, the swarm should gather and move together to maintain a virtual system. In the swarm, some robots serve as the beacons if they run into a newly searched area, and they turn back to the role of mapping and searching if there are already enough beacons nearby. With such scheme, the swarm can maintain the coordinating system to draw the map with high accuracy in a distributed way. Correll and Martinoli [136] developed an intelligent inspection system with on-board local sensors. In their proposed strategy, part of the robots in the swarm act as the beacons, and the strategy is compared to other beaconless approaches. They also analyzed the system with probabilistic microscopic and macroscopic models. Spears et al. [137] developed a relative localization module for determining the positions of nearby robots based on trilateration for searching problems. The robots identify the nearby robots with three marking points equipped physically on robots to match the distance and direction of their neighbors. This strategy is fully distributed, scalable, inexpensive and robust. The system provides a framework for both localization and information exchange. Stirling et al. [138] presented a new autonomous flight methodology for autonomous navigation and goal directed flight in unknown indoor environments using a swarm of flying robots. The approach is entirely decentralized and relies only on local sensing without global positioning, communication, or prior information about the environment. Marjovi et al. [139] proposed a navigation method by guiding the swarm using wireless connections when the odor sources are searched. At least three individuals in the swarm act as the beacons which broadcast the coordinates to the whole swarm to maintain a global coordinate system while the others search for the odor. The shortcoming of this research is that the beacons are broadcasting the coordination in a large area while other robots should detect the distance with the beacons from a long distance, which requires expensive hardware. 5.3.3.2 Simulating ant colonies Ant colonies in the nature are famous for the navigation and migration behaviors with the help of pheromones. The researchers of the swarm robotics society employed such scheme into swarm robotics by simulating the pheromones using part of the robots in the swarm which serve as the beacons. An interesting study was proposed by Sperati et al. [140]. In their experiment, a robotic swarm manages to collectively explore the environment, forming a path to navigate between two target areas, which are too distant to be perceived by an agent at the same time. The robots continuously move back and forth between the two locations while they interact with their neighbors. The behaviors of the robots are controlled by a neural network and the swarm evolves to optimize the path. They observed that the swarm finally converges to the shortest path. In their follow-up work, one of the schemes simulating ant colonies was proposed [141]. They searched for an efficient exploration and navigation strategy for the same problem. They evaluated one run of a robot through the time and distance spent to find the path and optimize the searching using the evolutionary methods. The final results show that the swarm has great flexibility and robustness. Ducatelle et al. [142] investigated how the simple local interactions between the robots of the different swarms can cooperate to solve the complex tasks by using eye-bots and foot-bots from the swarmanoid project. The foot-bots move back and forth between source and target and avoid the obstacles without any interaction with other foot-bots; the eye-bots simulate the pheromones in the environment and guide passing by foot-bot with local direction. The eye-bots update the weights of the directions and move towards the optimized path to accelerate the searching process. Simulation results show that the system is capable of finding a shortest path and spreading in an automatic traffic. 5.3.4 Obstacle avoidance Obstacle avoidance is also considered an important basic task in the swarm robotics society. In most researches, some sort of potential functions has been applied to the robots. The swarm steers around the encountered obstacles according to the potential fields. Khatib [143] first introduced this concept in real-time obstacle avoidance in 1986. He used a time-varying artificial potential field for moving obstacles. This solution successfully converted the traditionally high level planning problem into distributed real-time operations even in complex environment. Some recent examples also used such scheme. Das et al. [144] proposed an approach that switches between several controllers, depending on the state of the robot for obstacle avoidance. Shao et al. [145] proposed a similar kinematic controller and modified the desired bearing to steer the robots around the obstacles. Do [146] used a potential function for avoiding collisions within the swarm. The function alters the robots' trajectory if they are not at their heading direction. In Ref. [122], the obstacles generate a virtual repulsive force similar to the mechanism in atomic nucleus, and the robots play the roles of electrons to fly around the nucleus. Kurabayashi and Osagawa [147] proposed formation transition and obstacle avoidance adapting to the geometrical features appearing in Delaunay diagram. The robots select their neighbors in the diagram by the proposed strategy and form a topology connecting all the individuals lead by a certain robot. The algorithm shows some flexibility but is vulnerable in robustness. Min et al. [148] proposed a new method for avoiding the obstacles in dynamic environment based on the second order motion model for robotics. A mathematical model based on the destination of robot, velocity and direction of obstacles was proposed and optimized using PSO. Simulation experiment shows that the method is better than the tradition artificial potential field methods, though it requires a large amount of computation since each robot maintains a PSO model separately. 5.4 Swarm robotics searching algorithms Currently, swarm robotic searching algorithm is one of the most concerns of the researchers besides those basic tasks mentioned in previous section. In this section, the searching strategies are classified in two types: one inspired from the swarm intelligence algorithms and the other inspired form other methods. These two types of algorithms are different in many aspects, such as searching scheme, target detection method and information exchange inside the swarm. 5.4.1 Inspired from swarm intelligence algorithms From the general point of view, swarm optimization algorithms share several similarities with swarm robotics searching, e.g. searching for the best points using a swarm of individuals. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is the swarm intelligence approach that is adopted mostly in the swarm robotics due to the great similarity with flocking and searching schemes. Besides PSO, other methods have also inspired many successful approaches, such as ant colony optimization (ACO) and glowworm swarm optimization (GSO). The scope of these approaches includes path finding, navigation, odor localization, etc. The swarm intelligence shows great ability in scalable, flexibility and robustness and is suitable for real life applications with the aid of various existing strategies. However, the shortcomings of these algorithms are also introduced in the same time, e.g. large quantity of random moves, global interactions and especially tending to get trapped in the local minimal. Couceiro et al. [149] proposed a RDPSO for solving the last issue. They divide the swarms into sub-swarms with dynamic topology updated in several iterations based on a reward and punishment mechanism. However, the sub-swarms are divided ignoring the distance metrics and escape the local minimum at the cost of global communication and coordinating system. There exist three types of methods in using the swarm intelligence algorithms so far: 5.4.1.1 Optimizing the parameters The first type of searching algorithms inspires the strategies from other methods with several parameters which are hard to be optimized, such as neural network or heuristic schemes. The swarm intelligence algorithms are employed to optimize these parameters. Meng [150] proposed a collective construction task for searching the randomly distributed building blocks and transporting these blocks to the predefined locations. The method employs the virtual pheromone trail for information exchange and the task allocation for cooperative transportation. A modified PSO was proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation in their work. Pugh [151] explored the use of PSO for the noisy problems of unsupervised robotic learning. He adapted a technique of overcoming noise from genetic algorithm (GA) and evaluated it on unsupervised learning of obstacle avoidance using a swarm of robots. In his follow-up work with Martinoli [152], they presented an adaptive strategy for localization of multiple targets. The search algorithm is inspired from chemotaxis behavior in bacteria, and the algorithmic parameters are updated using PSO. To overcome the weakness and difficulty of the logical design of behavioral rules, Oh and Suk [153] proposed an artificial neural network controller that is applied to the mission of searching the obstructive areas using a swarm of UAVs. Genetic algorithm is applied to evolve the weights in the neural network which shows superior results to other controllers. Yang and Li [154] proposed a path planning algorithm based on improved PSO. The center of the path is described as cubic splines, and the path planning is equivalent to parameter optimization of these cubic splines. Results show that the obstacle avoiding paths can be optimized using such scheme. 5.4.1.2 Modeling the individual behaviors In this type of algorithms, each robot is regarded as a particle or agent correspondingly in the swarm intelligence algorithm. The searching environment is normally interpreted as fitness values. The swarm uses the fitness to search for the targets. Pugh and Martinoli [155] explored the possibility of adopting PSO strategies in swarm robotics searching directly. Each robot is regarded as a particle and various neighborhood topologies, and PSO update strategies are verified. In their follow-up work [156], they designed an effective algorithm that allows a swarm of robots to work together to find the targets. They proposed the techniques inspired from PSO modified to mimic the swarm robotics search process. Analysis of parameters and setups in the model are also presented at an abstracted level. Marques et al. [29] presented a PSO inspired algorithm for searching the odor sources in a large search space. The robots try to repulse each other when no chemical cue exists nearby to improve the swarm performance. Hereford [157] applied PSO on a swarm of robots searching for the light spots in a room containing the obstacles. Each robot is regarded as a particle and broadcasts its information to the whole swarm. The shortcoming of the experiment is that it only considers three robots with a large amount of global communication to maintain the global best of the swarm. Derr and Manic [158] considered problem of exploring an unknown environment to find the targets at the unknown locations. They used PSO with a novel adaptive RSS weighting factor to locate targets. Zhu et al. [159] presented a PSO-inspired search algorithm that coordinates the robots to find the targets without precise global information. They also introduced a Cartesian geometry based method for unifying the relative coordinate systems to improve robustness and efficiency. Zhang et al. [160] proposed a strategy based on modified glowworm swarm optimization for multiple odor source localization. This strategy includes global random search and local GSO based search. A discovered source is marked as forbidden area to ensure that the swarm does not locate this source again. An interesting resource exploration task on Mars was imagined by Kisdi and Tatnall [161]. They suppose the situation that a lander leads a swarm of workers who cannot interact with each other. The lander is unable to move and serves as a shared memory as well as the coordinator of the swarm. The workers search in the environment in the area ordered by the lander and return their results back to the lander. The scheme of the lander is similar with that of maintaining the archives in multi-objective search in swarm intelligence. Human interaction is also available at the lander to mark the interesting areas. 5.4.1.3 Mixing two methods above Some algorithms try to use the swarm intelligence model and optimize the parameters using swarm intelligence in the same time. Doctor [162] proposed a method utilizing two layers of PSO for controlling the unmanned mobile robots in target tracing application. The robots are controlled by the schemes in inner layer of the PSO and the parameters of inner layer are optimized by the outer layer. Signal intensity from targets is defined as the fitness to search for the swarm. The solutions for real-time uniform coverage tasks in military applications under the harsh and bandwidth limited conditions were proposed by Conner et al. [163]. They encode each robot as a genome and exchange speed and direction with neighbors. A force-based genetic algorithm is used at the swarm level to determine the behavior of each robot under the threats of hostile attack, obstacles and intermittent stoppage of communication. The swarm always tries to rearrange the positions to compensate for the missing robots. 5.4.2 Inspired from other methods Olfaction is a common ability that the animals use in their everyday activities, such as hunting, mating, interacting and evading the predators. Such schemes inspired from the animals have been widely used in the swarm robotics applications, such as localization of odor sources, which have attracted a growing interest in the areas such as anti-terrorist, location of toxic or harmful gas leakage, checking for contraband, exploration of mineral resources in dangerous areas and search-and-rescue in collapsed building [164]. A common olfaction based algorithms can be decomposed into three or four sub procedures first proposed by Hayes [165] and Li [166]. The swarm first searches for a plume and follows the plume to the odor source once a plume is located. The sub-procedures are different from other approaches such as gradient descent method [167], zigzagging method [168], and upwind method [169]. Cui et al. [170] proposed a biasing expansion swarm approach to collaboratively search and locate various number of emission sources in an unknown area using a swarm of simple robots. Jatmiko et al. [171] provided a model of odor-gated rheotaxis combined with chemotaxic and anemotaxic (upstream) methods to solve the odor source localization problems. The combined model can achieve high accuracy in real life scenarios containing dynamic sources, random winds and obstacles. Russell et al. [172] summarized and compared the implementation and evaluation of four chemotaxis algorithms which provide fast, simple and cost-effective solutions for olfaction based searching applications in obstructive environments. They listed the details of the algorithms together with typical results of these algorithms obtained in both simulated and practical experiments. Besides olfaction, other searching applications and strategies have been also proposed. Varela et al. [173] developed an algorithm for coordinating a group of UAVs to monitor the environment. The UAV swarm can locate the undesired phenomenon. The UAVs compare the average fitness of last five iterations with their neighbors and select the direction of the best neighbor to search in the next iteration. They validated the algorithm in real UAVs monitoring and industrial area. Wu and Zhang [174] developed a switching strategy for locating a local minimum in an unknown noisy scalar field. Robots will switch to cooperative exploration only when they are not able to converge to a local minimum at a satisfying rate according to a cooperative filter. The switching strategy can result in faster convergence and is robust to unknown noise and communication delay. A robust-satisficing approach based on info-gap theory was suggested as a solution for a spatial search-planning problem by Sisso et al. [175]. The swarm is given uncertain prior information data with severe errors. The proposed method shows great superior in robustness to the expected-utility maximizing strategy. Lee and Ahn [176] proposed a foraging algorithm specially focused on energy efficiency. Through adding several temporal storage stations in the environment the swarm can improve the searching efficiency since the robot will move a shorter distance to the storage before next forage. The swarm is divided into two parts, one part searches for the food and sends the food to the nearest station, while others transfer the food from the station to the nest. In this way, both time and energy efficiency are improved although several prior knowledge about the environment is required. Besides these common methods, other strategies were also proposed by the researchers. Nouyan and Dorigo [177] proposed a chain based path formation algorithm to generate a chain of robots from nest to a destination unknown to the swarm. In their method, each robot is regarded as a finite state machine with only three states: explore, search and chain. The robot explores in the field for any existing chains, searches for the end and joins. With limited sensing and communication, the swarm can chain up with great robustness and scalability. In their follow-up study [178], they extend the task by transporting the target back to the nest. The robots have to work together and pull the target along the chain back to the nest while the chaining robots will join the transportation after the target passes them. Their work is one of the most complicated tasks that have ever been considered in self-organizing robot swarms in the real life projects. 6 Conclusions Swarm robotics is a relatively new researching area inspired from swarm intelligence and robotics. Although a number of researches have been proposed, it's still quite far for practical application. The authors hereby proposed several fundamental problems to solve in future before the system can really be adopted in everyday life. How can the cooperative schemes inspired from the nature swarms integrate with the limited sensing and computing abilities for a desired swarm level behavior? How to describe the swarm robotics system in a mathematical model which can predict the system behaviors at both individual and swarm level? How to propose a new and general strategy that can take full advantage of the swarm robotics system? And finally, how to design a swarm of robots with low cost and limited abilities which has the potential to show great swarm level intelligence through carefully designed cooperation? Besides the cooperative algorithms to provide control for the swarm, the manufacturing is a fundamental need for developing the swarm robotics systems. With the help of advance in Micro Electro Mechanical technology in the aspects of mechanical transmission, sensors, actuators and electronic components, the size and cost of robots have been significantly reduced. The authors believe that the progresses of hardware technology and cooperative schemes in both biology and swarm intelligence in future will boost the development of swarm robotics systems.

The type of tool, amount of effort and form of energy required depends on the output or object being created. As tools evolved into machines, they enhanced operator productivity. Hence, industry continues to invest heavily in machines to assist people to do more with less physical control and/or interaction. This involves automating functions previously completed manually. Taylorism and the Hawthorn experiments all contributed to optimising industrial outputs and value engineers continue to promote a mecha- nized workforce in order to minimise business variations in human performance and their behaviour. Researchers have also pursued this goal using Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques. This process of transforming cognitive functionality into machine actionable form has encompassed many careers. Machine Intelligence (MI) is becoming more aspirational, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabling the achievement of numerous goals. More recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been employed to provide a flexible framework for research and development. These frameworks facilitate the development of component interoperability, with coordination and cooperation techniques needed to solve real-world problems. However problems typically manifest in complex, dynamic and often hostile environments. Based on the effort to seek or facilitate human-like decision making within machines, it is clear that further research is required. This paper discusses one possible avenue. It involves future research, aimed at achieving a cognitive sub-system for use on-board platforms. The framework is introduced by describing the human-machine relationship, followed by the theoretic background into cognitive architectures and a conceptual mechanism that could be used to implement a virtual mind. One which could be used to improve automation, achieve greater independence and enable more autonomous behaviour within control systems. Crown copyright c\u00c2\u00a9 2013 Dr Jeffrey W. Tweedale.

The linguistic definition of autonomy involves independence, freedom, self- governance and the rights or will of an individual [1], whereas, machines don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the ability to make conscious decisions, rationalise information or even recognise objects within a given context. They can only enforce pre- programmed decision-making and engage in limited forms of learning. Attempts have been made to provide machines with human-like decision-making capabilities, with limited success. Most research has been conducted within a constrained environment and focused on specific outcomes. This paper discusses one possible avenue of future research towards achieving a cognitive sub-system that may eventually reside and operate on an unmanned platform [2]. The concept of creating a virtual mind underpins efforts to improve automation by enabling greater independence and more autonomous behaviour within control systems. A future with autonomous systems would introduce a ternary relationship between humans, machines and the level of effort or control required to achieve desired outcomes. A host of interrelated organisational and industrial functions need to be communicated. Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are often used to provide components with sufficient capabilities required to solve complex issues. Such agent frameworks enable designers to abstract away system complexities, such as coordination, cooperation and communication [3]. Several of these capabilities rely on one or more Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and often involve hybridized solutions using agent teams. Literature reviews reveal that the AI domain remains challenged with investigating and modelling complex real world problems when developing intelligent solutions. The field is being supported by ongoing increases in processing power, communication infrastructure and distributed paradigms. People increasingly use smart tech- nologies in their business, social and professional lives. There is an increasing reliance on technology in how we live our lives and in hybrid solutions that holistically solve real world problems. For instance, technology can be used to process a sense, decide, act loop, although the decision making process is generally augmented through human intervention. Although modern sensors and actuators integrate processing abilities (making them capa- ble of interacting with the environment), humans still provide most of the cognitive decision-making. Currently researchers rely on AI techniques to obtain information and help with decision making to solve isolated prob- lems. Unfortunately these techniques currently do not exhibit sufficient intelligence to address complex cognitive problems. Intelligence implies elements of a humans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to reason, learn and react based on ethics or values, including all traits that enable mammalian beings to adapt to new or unpredictable environments. The AI domain also consists of many diverse sub-domains that form the current research frontier. Exam- ples include: signal processing, knowledge representation (of structured and unstructured data), computational modelling, pattern recognition, data analytics, behavioural modelling and knowledge discovery which could be embedded in a virtual mind. These domains encompass research or innovation that aims to meet the emerging needs of industry and the community. The potential of AI is enormous and its full breadth is difficult to fully grasp, although it is believed that a golden age is beginning. This renewed interest in the modern era of AI is anticipated because of the domains\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 evolving technical capability to solve complex real world problems through the use of MAS [3]. This paper provides a brief introduction into future research that is pursuing autonomy using automated com- ponents within a MAS framework. Section 2 provides background knowledge of the business models surrounding industry, while Section 3 discusses a number of concepts related to automation. Section 4 introduces issues surrounding Machine Intelligence (MI), the environment and its Governance. Section 5 discusses the concept of providing a cognitive architecture that may assist in delivering decision-making and possibly lead to indepen- dence or self-governance (autonomy). This discussion is followed by a description of the proposed conceptual framework in Section 6 and then a conclusion with comments about future research. 2. Background As humans evolved, they slowly transitioned from a hunter and gatherer or subsistence society, to more structured communities that collectively provided for one another. Communities established trade-routes with other societies. Land owners formalised economic relationships to establish food assurance and domesticated plants and animals to promote production. Machines eventually improved economies of scale and their associated activities to stimulate the agricultural revolution. This led to the birth of the producer-suppliermodel of production (outputs). 1371 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 As cottage industry gave way to organised production and eventually the industrial revolution, techniques pro- moted by Taylor [4] and Mayo [5] helped optimize workplace performance and motivation. Efficiency engineers used the Hawthorne effect to enhance production outputs within a supply model. Corporations also internation- ally championed this approach and thereby disrupted the supply model to generate outputs globally (disrupting disparate supply chains). Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between humans, machines and the outputs they produce. Fig. 1. The relationship between people, machines and their achievements or outputs Organizationally, the original subsistence model grew vertically with segments relating to workers, manage- ment and outputs. Additional layers were introduced during the industrial revolution and, when communities started to populate cities, management controls were implanted to coordinate outputs in a new consumer/supply model. Slowly these segments then started to separate laterally under pressure from corporations who rationalised decentralized components into global models. The resulting consumer/provider/supplymodel is slowly transform- ing how society interacts with supply and its links to industry. Figure 2 depicts how machines are being used to increasingly wedge affected segments apart. Unfortunately this process is further isolating communication links and displacing people from existing production systems (outputs), which affects functional efficiencies because these systems were originally designed around people and not machines. Value engineers continue to embrace technology to mechanise the workforce. This increased employment of machines continues to displace workers. The more primitive machines operate using closed loop systems; however, as complexity increases, additional systems or layers are wrapped around the central control loop to enable the controlled injection of external influences. A modern example could be a flight management system on an aircraft (fly-by-wire). Such systems typically maintain attitude control in real-time, although positional offsets can be injected to adjust the motion of the physical platform and its geographical location. Additional loops may support further automation, such as an autopilot function or augmented safety systems. Humans increasingly rely on machines to assist them in manufacturing and support their everyday lives. Dur- ing the post war era, industry embraced robotics and continues to mechanize its workforce. The trend began with logistic systems (packing, stacking, canning and bottling). Some mechanised functions are no-longer lim- ited to static locations (painting, welding and assembly), creating a transition from machines being operated by humans to a paradigm where people simply supervise process flows. Recently machines are being controlled remotely through \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctelevisory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 links, while other systems have seamlessly automated functionality [6]. This has generated significant discussion over terminology. Currently people operate tools and supervise automated ma- chines, however in the future humans may simply choose to employ an autonomous capability. One assumption is that machines are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that transform energy into one or more actions [7]. Another is that machines evolved as a result of automation to enable more system capabilities [8]. This transformation is consistent with plans to im- prove manufacturing throughput and the quality of products, but displaces humans in the process. True autonomy 1372 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 Fig. 2. Inter-related Components within an Autonomous System should be considered as self-governance, with a state or condition that enables independent decision making. This implies an evolutionary cycle that unifies automation and autonomy. They are not mutually exclusive terms, but operators will employ multiple systems (containing automated functionality) to enable more autonomous outputs. The computer is an autonomous tool that can be used to extend the humans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capacity to enhance productivity. Humans provide the cognitive stimulus as the primary decision maker, while the machine provides the processing capacity to automate functions previously completed manually. An example is productivity enabled by software tools like spreadsheets, word-processors and presentation applications. In production systems, MI automates processes and sequences requiring constant human intervention or control. Engineers are forced to anticipate the cognitive requirements for any derived task and synthesise suitable systems intended to provide human-like responses. If researchers want machines to engage in human-like activities, there is a need to synthesize the appropriate cognitive skills (possibly a primitive brain). This is a non-trivial task, with many complexities being tackled in isolation. Examples include: DefenceAdvancedResearch Project Agencys (DARPAs) Grand Challenge [9], their Systems of Neuromorphics Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics (SyNAPSE) program [10] and the Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST) Modular Neural Exploring Travelling Agent (MoNETA) activity [11]. Based on the parallel nature of the brain and existing effort, more needs to be done to coordinate research in this domain. For instance making machines perceive information within their environment and then to recognise facts or knowledge. There is a need for machines to process environmental information and transform perceived knowledge within context to create awareness. Once information is recognised, categorised and transformed, a virtual brain should be able to engage in human-like reasoning against multiple criteria (ethics, values or even 1373 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 beliefs) and then evaluate courses of action and rationalise about possible outcomes. If this process arrives at an acceptable solution, formal planning may begin before committing to a decision to act upon. Once the decision is communicated (internally or externally) the cycle of evaluation continues with possible refinement or adjustment based on the resultant environmental information (that accumulates over time), and to build a primitive level of awareness. 3. Existing Contributions Humans currently perform a broad range of tasks that require a variety of skills. Each task may require the human to adopt one or more roles. It is possible that each role is fulfilled using a prescribed set of rules and the knowledge required provides focus and orients the mind-set required to achieve successful outcomes. The situation will determine the context by which decisions are made. Humans have typically been trained to cope with a select set of processes and procedures (complete with their own rules, boundaries and constraints). These skill sets will normally be employed routinely after acquiring a prescribed competency and level of expertise (now retained as knowledge). The ability to embed knowledge into a capability will determine the capacity of machines to fulfil cognitive roles. That employment is also reliant on societies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acceptance or willingness to employ those machines. Prior to acceptance, researchers need to satisfy the requirement to provide machines with the ability to recognise and dynamically adapt to instil awareness of their environment. GeneralMotors installed the first industrial robot (Unimate) in its New Jersey factory in 1961. The mechanized work force continues to evolve. Today there are between 50\u00e2\u20ac\u201c250 robots per 10,000 employees 1 within industrial nations [12]. According to the International Federation of Robotics 2 , this figure will grow by 200,000 installations per annum. After identifying propositions to increase scale and productivity, all BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) have also declared plans to significantly increase future investment in robotic manufacturing. Machines are still considered primitive with respect to human-level intelligence. Machines lack cognitive skills and this reduces industries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to displace humans engaged in higher order activities. Unlike humans, there is no convenient method of comparing or categorising cognitive skills within machines. For instance, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a mechanism to measure machine intelligence or determine a Machine Quotient (MQ); however, it would be useful to be able to compare that score against an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) ranking. A benchmark of human-like intelligence may make the level of cognitive processing easier to identify and ultimately help derive a workable solution. There are many factors to consider before science can achieve self-governance or autonomy within machines. Such an achievement would produce a sound definition and result in real autonomy.Atpresent,many industries still relying on automation to insulate them against labour shortages and demographic shifts. Many of the adopters are already reporting improvements in long-term sustainability, ecologically friendly production and power efficient measures that often leads to increased profit margins (globally). The author asserts it is possible for researchers to collaboratively employ \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintelligent capabilities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 using automated sub-systems to improve the level of autonomy. Increased investment is required to facilitate the use of more modern AI techniques and therefore promoting a shift towards improved automation. These improvements can be realised when humans use tools, machine assistants and even intelligent systems within the work place. As individuals participate in delivering specific activities, teams are often required to deliver larger outcomes. Many teams may be required to complete increasingly more complex tasks. When a team grows, organisations typically use predetermined hierarchies that contain embedded links to manage the group. An example includes activities; such as, the coordination of either, cooperation or Command and Control (C2). Additional mechanisms are then required to elicit efficient collaboration and situation awareness through cooperative processes. The situation is generally monitored within the constraints of a mission or goal. There is a computational cost in maintaining or coordinating the number and variety of adjustments needed to enact or redirect the system goals. As with all complex systems, there is the potential to cause a ripple effect in which each action can create the possibility of unintended outcomes through emergent properties. These can trigger a need to review 1 In Australian terms this equates to only 0.5%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.5% of its total workforce. 2 These statistics are reported at www.worldrobotics.org 1374 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 outstanding plans and their associated actions to better reflect the equivalent human processes. This declarative knowledge also needs to be assimilated by engineers within a final product offering. An inference system can be incorporated to assist machines to exhibit human-like behaviors. There are a number of existing models, based on concepts like the Joint Director of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion [13], Boyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop and Beliefs, Desires and Intent (BDI) agents [14]. These models and techniques should be reviewed to reflect a dynamic environment based on complex scenarios in the real-world. For instance, machines sense the environment, where humans observe their surroundings. To achieve human-like computation, the machines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 primitive mind (using an internal loop to be used for cognitive thought) might include: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sense (Observe) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Detect (Perceive) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Acquire (Recognise) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Categorise (Rationalise) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Orient (Contextualise) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Transform (Reason) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Choose (Determine) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Commit (Act) Boyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OODA loop describes the human cognitive processes (in terms of wet-ware or Gray-ware) whereasma- chines use BDI agents to incorporate decision-making processes. This is limited to a sense-decide-act loop within the computational components. Machines only achieve tasks they have been programmed for and commanded to achieve certain goals. It is therefore difficult for machines to cope in unknown environments, especially when humans provide off-board decision making. Ultimately, elements of the BDI loop must be augmented using the functionality associated with the OODA loop. It is not clear what the final system will be called and/or what it will contain (See Section 4), however there is evidence that a virtual mind will potentially enable more autonomous decision making on-board unmanned platforms (See Section 5). Information only becomes knowledge after data is collected, integrated and processed. Raw data needs to be perceived and recognised prior to being rationalised against a given context. If the system is aware of new infor- mation or facts, it can adapt the process based on extant knowledge or existing rules before consciously assessing the ramifications. This may provide a rationalising effect by considering a series of possible outcomes before committing to a specific decision or action. Humans traditionally gather information from their environment and process it internally before committing to a specific course of action. Consistent with this, researchers seek to embed cognitive functions within machines, but humans are often still required to mediate and communicate de- cisions before machines can act. Figure 3 depicts the interactions for a complex and dynamic environment within a real-world context. Fig. 3. Real-world Interaction 1375 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 Human-computer systems are sometimes modelled as continuous loops that sense environmental information. That information may be processed and accumulated in a knowledge-base or repository. Other functions may be applied to interpret or rationalise new facts against embedded or acquired rules. The rules need to be adapted to operate within the context of a situation and based on the context or tempo of each mission or goal. 4. The Machine Intelligence Environment The origins of MI appear to have been consolidated at a workshop at Carnegie Mellon University in 1980. Given the overlapping effort of research using both AI and cognitive science to elicit learning, a journal 3 was conceived to focus on methods used to improve machine performance of a nominated task(s). This includes the representation, acquisition, structuring, categorization and classification of data to extrude knowledge [15]. It now includes techniques that sponsor symbolic representation and machine vision. Early topics included: pro- duction rules, decision trees and procedural reasoning. The original definition of MI was expanded to improving performance through experience, for instance using techniques like pattern recognition and data-mining or knowl- edge refinement (through probabilistic instance-based representation). More recently there is growing emphasis on knowledge classification and inductive logic (for regression tasks). In a recent editorial, Langley suggests it is time for Machine Learning (ML) to focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153developing intelligent systems that exhibit the rich behaviour of complex tasks and acquire knowledge cast in rich relational structures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [16]. Many scientists consider that on-board MI is essential for efficient recognition and understanding within complex or dynamic environments [17]. Some agree that further research into augmented reality [18] is one possible avenue of generating rich meta data that is often used for machines to learn or adapt within a given context. Another potential push is to exploit contextual databases like the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCycorp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 semantic web [19]. An alternative is to pursue research into cognitive architectures or hybrid reasoning systems. The DARPA recently commissioned several projects that influence AI developments, including a series of autonomous car demonstrations. For instance, in 2006 a team of researchers employed a Volkswagen Touraeg to successfully cover 212 kilometres across the Mojave desert to win the Grand Challenge. This autonomous car utilized a complex array of brain-inspired microprocessors embedded into fourteen blade severs. The competition was extended in 2007, and all challengers (their machines) failed the common knowledge test. This test called for machines to demonstrate basic driving tasks, such as merging, passing, parking, negotiating intersections and avoiding random objects (such as rocks or pedestrians). It is clear that the sensors fitted to the machines enabled them to perceive changes within its environment, but their decision-making system(s) failed to recognise random threats introduced throughout the challenge. This example indicates that despite the processing capacity of each machine, their design(s) continue to fail primitive survival challenges. The same challenges a rat with only two grams of grey matter achieves routinely. Researchers endeavour to replicate the brain using silicon systems. These machines use significant Central Processing Unit (CPU) resources, and few have managed to emulate the brain (The MoNETA Project synthesized a small mammal in 2010. This contained over 60,000 neurons and 120 million synaptic connections [11]). A human brain has 100 billion neurons and, regardless of cost or resources, an emulated equivalent would consume the power of a medium sized town to switch it on. This research acknowledges that the human brain runs as a massively parallel system and conducts knowledge processing in-line with any associated data. Even with further research in the MI domain, cognitive architectures will rely on improvements in Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques. Following these achievements, it may be possible to combine the scientific understanding of the brain with improved parallel processing techniques in software in order to further investigate a virtual application that enables machines to make higher-order cognitive decisions. 5. Cognitive Architectures A cognitive architecture provides a framework upon which physical symbolic systems may be realised. It provides definitions, resources, constraints and management processes needed to achieve cognitive processing. 3 See the Machine Learning Journal, originally published by Kluwer, however the editors have since championed the Machine Learning Journal - Research at http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/ (which is free on-line) 1376 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 A number of cognitive architectures have evolved, including Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) [20], Soar [21], Adaptive Character of Thought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Rational (ACTR) [22], ICARUS [23], PRODIGY [24], distributed Multi- Agent Reasoning System (dMars) [25] and a suite of BDI [26] agent frameworks. Each seeks to develop a form of perception that learns environmental information based on human-like or a cognitively focused architecture (mimicking human-like behaviours) to solve realistic problems. Some architectures failed because they attempted to map and reproduce (or personify) human-like functions and procedures. It may be possible to stimulate machines to provide appropriate responses without the need to duplicate or mimic human cognition, although recognition, learning, memory (persistent and temporal), reasoning and rationality are key attributes that must be pursued. Figure 4 shows the taxonomy for a simplified cognitive architecture proposed by Dutch et al. in 2008 [27]. Fig. 4. Simplified Taxonomy for a Cognitive Architecture [27] A group of researchers continue to expand the ICARUS cognitive architecture. This software was originally developed at the Stanford University in the 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It is an agent framework that allows researchers to host a system with human-like decision making capability. ICARUS specifies the learning behaviour of AI agents, where new skills are identified following on from a success when problem solving [28]. Its architecture is segmented into modular components: a perceptual system (ARGUS), a planning system (DAEDALUS), an execution system (MAEANDER), and the memory system (LABYRINTH). It uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to map convergent activities based on the State Hierarchy, Action, Reward, State Hierarchy, Action (SHARSHA) re-enforcement algorithm [29]. It stores the short-term situation (accumulated status) and long-term knowledge (learned behaviour) in buffers as a skills hierarchy. Based on the literature, few of the existing architectures have used or considered more modern constructs; such as coordination, cooperation or the notion of teams within organisational hierarchies. 6. Conceptual Framework As suggested above, this paper is aimed at creating discussion about the research required to implement a cognitive framework. Figure 5 represents the authors conceptual design of an agent framework that might be used to support future research into human-like aspects of decision making. This framework could employ hybrid cognitive architectures that can support a virtual mind. 1377 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 Fig. 5. First Draft of a Conceptual Agent Framework The MAS system is the central feature of the framework. Each agent within the system will encapsulate one or more capabilities, while hidden elements abstract away the enterprise level functionality. Layers of the agent system provide interoperable functions, such as logging, communications, migration and any other interfaces re- quired by the parent application. The agents operate within a centralized (services-based) knowledge repository, that is structured by category and allows the agent system to seamlessly perform context switching, while main- taining a real-time interpretation of the world. As with all knowledge systems, data must be transformed into information. That information must be categorised and validated as relevant knowledge that is accessible by the system. The author believes an inference engine should also be integrated within the MAS to assist in the promo- tion and interrogation of the growing knowledge repository. The agent system interfaces with both the operator (traditionally humans) and other clients. Future systems could aim to provide autonomous operators, which could also be clients of other systems. The tools at the bottom of the figure may vary, according to the application, and those provided as examples. 7. Conclusion and Future Modern concepts related to CI and AI may eventually support human-like MI. The development of a virtual mind is non-trivial and significant effort is still required to achieve cognitive decision making on-board unmanned 1378 Jeffrey W. Tweedale / Procedia Computer Science 22 ( 2013 ) 1369 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1378 systems. Analysis of existing cognitive architectures is ongoing. Once complete, modern technology can then be incorporated to exploit hybrid techniques in the agent system environment. More effort is required to elicit a feasible structure (possible future standard) that represents both information and knowledge obtained within a dynamic, real-word environment. This concept relies on the MAS framework to abstract away the enterprise level complexity. The latter is aimed at hiding the system complexity and enable less qualified researchers to streamline the employment of new capabilities. The author believes that once the MAS framework is fully investigated, a cognitive architecture would evolve. Experiments can be used to validate the final capability and facilitate the transformation of declarative knowledge within a virtual mind. References [1] A.

Humans have used tools to transform raw resources into valued outputs ever since society harnessed fire. The type of tool, amount of effort and form of energy required depends on the output or object being created. As tools evolved into machines, they enhanced operator productivity. Hence, industry continues to invest heavily in machines to assist people to do more with less physical control and/or interaction. This involves automating functions previously completed manually. Taylorism and the Hawthorn experiments all contributed to optimising industrial outputs and value engineers continue to promote a mecha- nized workforce in order to minimise business variations in human performance and their behaviour. Researchers have also pursued this goal using Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques. This process of transforming cognitive functionality into machine actionable form has encompassed many careers. Machine Intelligence (MI) is becoming more aspirational, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabling the achievement of numerous goals. More recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been employed to provide a flexible framework for research and development. These frameworks facilitate the development of component interoperability, with coordination and cooperation techniques needed to solve real-world problems. However problems typically manifest in complex, dynamic and often hostile environments. Based on the effort to seek or facilitate human-like decision making within machines, it is clear that further research is required. This paper discusses one possible avenue. It involves future research, aimed at achieving a cognitive sub-system for use on-board platforms. The framework is introduced by describing the human-machine relationship, followed by the theoretic background into cognitive architectures and a conceptual mechanism that could be used to implement a virtual mind. One which could be used to improve automation, achieve greater independence and enable more autonomous behaviour within control systems.
