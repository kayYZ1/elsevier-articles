Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently been shown as an excellent tool for the study of the liver; however, many obstacles still have to be overcome for the digitalization of real-world hepatology. The authors present an overview of the current state of the art on the use of innovative technologies in different areas (big data, translational hepatology, imaging, and transplant setting). In clinical practice, physicians must integrate a vast array of data modalities (medical history, clinical data, laboratory tests, imaging, and pathology slides) to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic decision. Unfortunately, machine learning and deep learning are still far from really supporting clinicians in real life. In fact, the accuracy of any technological support has no value in medicine without the support of clinicians. To make better use of new technologies, it is essential to improve clinicians\u2019 knowledge about them. To this end, the authors propose that collaborative networks for multidisciplinary approaches will improve the rapid implementation of AI systems for developing disease-customized AI-powered clinical decision support tools. The authors also discuss ethical, educational, and legal challenges that must be overcome to build robust bridges and deploy potentially effective AI in real-world clinical settings. Keywords Artificial Intelligence Big data Imaging Liver disease Robotic Transplantation 1 Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) can not only help improve the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases but also can play a central role in future liver research. In line with available forecasts, European countries have already started to create artificial neural networks; thus, it is possible to propose that AI will overcome current prejudices and will soon be fully integrated into daily clinical practice. Moreover, translational hepatology is an area that focuses mainly on the study of liver disorders and associated remedies and places particular emphasis on converting fundamental scientific findings into practical applications to address unsolved questions in a wide spectrum of liver disorders, including viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. When correlating historical data with real-world and digital data, there are a large number of open questions that can be better addressed with AI techniques. For example, AI is suggested to (1) predict the future distribution of liver diseases, (2) develop cost-effective solutions for liver disease diagnosis, (3) understand the progression of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), (4) determine the most effective treatment for different liver diseases, (5) identify the most effective treatments for slowing the progression of liver cirrhosis to decompensation and HCC, and (6) develop predictive models for effective liver organ allocation and survival outcomes after liver transplantation [1\u20134]. However, to achieve these goals, several clinical problems have to be solved. Challenges remain in fully implementing AI technologies in clinical practice, including the need to develop robust approaches for structured and unstructured data collection, sharing, and storage and the need to create guidelines, agreed with researchers with different skills, for producing reliable results through the use of mathematical models. AI can predict a large set of clinically relevant features, but now it is time to prove that these approaches work in a clinical setting by comparing algorithm performance with that of conventional systems and further focusing our effort on carefully designing large prospective trials. 2 Application of AI for interpreting big data derived from translational hepatology: obstacles to obtaining reliable results To develop trustworthy and practical AI systems in the area of translational hepatology, many issues must be addressed. First, the term big data in hepatology, as well as in other fields, includes a large panel of clinical parameters and analytics provided by omics, which comprises epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics [5]. The future of big data in translational hepatology will involve AI in three main steps: development and implementation of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches that may link multiple analytics by network fusion methods, translation of the results in clinical practice in terms of individualizing patient management, and sharing of data with a large community of clinicians and researchers. However, there is a lack of extensive, varied, and high-quality datasets, which are necessary to develop and test AI models. In addition, there is a lack of consistency of medical images in the collection and annotation of medical pictures, posing a problem that may affect how well AI models function across various institutions. Another issue is model explainability, which is essential when dealing with healthcare [6]. In particular, retrospective datasets can be subject to selection bias; ML models can propagate this bias after training on small and poorly representative data [7]. Explainability of the model represents a system that helps the researcher and the end user recognize why a model is reaching a specific conclusion. To this end, DL is still suboptimal for direct clinical applications until systems to open the blackbox are employed [8]. Since physicians must have confidence in the precision and dependability of the model's predictions, this can be a significant hurdle to adopting AI in clinical practice. The need for data that are rich, include ethnic minorities and under-represented populations, and are large in size has fueled collaborations among clinical and research centers. However, the data sharing legislation has progressively changed toward privacy protection, especially in Europe, after approval of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), adopted on April 14, 2016, and became enforceable beginning May 25, 2018. One approach to addressing this challenge is through federated learning, a new data-sharing method, or swarm learning based on blockchain systems, representing a promising trade-off between the need for large samples and data protection [9]. Federated learning and swarm learning are ML approaches that allow for the training of models across multiple devices or locations without centralizing or sharing the underlying data. In other words, they enable the training of a model on a large dataset without the need to share the data with a central location, thus preserving the privacy and security of the data. However, a federated learning approach would require the participation of multiple institutions to share their data, models, and computation power. Each institution trains a model on its own data and shares the updates with a central server, where they are aggregated to update a global model. It requires a collaboration level and a consensus on minimum datasets and business use cases that are seldom achieved in national and international settings, and this is probably the most complex challenge to tackle. More recently, experts on applications of AI in medicine have called for a paradigm shift of research toward clinical deployment [10]. To date, most studies have focused on training a model on retrospective data and validating it in other datasets without fully addressing how to integrate this model in the stream of clinical practice. A thorough examination and validation of AI models is required, which can be a time- and resource-intensive procedure. Regulations and guidelines are required to guarantee the moral and safe application of AI in clinical practice. Not less important will be the harmonization of privacy regulations and data protection laws. Finally, it is essential to educate hepatologists, data scientists, and developers of AI systems to fully utilize the potential of AI in the field of translational hepatology. This will stop the development of erroneous expectations and enable a more efficient application of AI in the detection and treatment of liver disorders. It will also help data scientists understand the complexities of the medical profession better. The latter will enable them to develop AI systems tailored to the specific needs of physicians (i.e., identifying the ideal biomarker patterns associated with the disease and patient data security) and that take into account the consequences of their decisions for the health and well-being of patients. Nevertheless, the digital transition of healthcare requires all experts to rethink the work process and identify where AI can fill the gaps in current diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks. The ideal goal would be not substituting the clinical workforce but rather the assistance to liberate clinicians from repetitive and redundant duties. It is in the essence of being translational that makes hepatology a discipline that must leverage the most advanced technology to translate basic scientific research into clinical practice and allow for tapping the potential of data toward the goal of improving outcomes and patients\u2019 well-being. 3 Application of AI in diagnostic imaging As outlined above, AI has a clear potential to play a significant role in the field of hepatology, particularly in the areas of imaging analysis to support diagnosis and prognostication of disease courses. In fact, for some years (almost a decade), images of radiology, particularly in the instance of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have become native digital information, providing relative ease to be retrieved and analyzed for computational purposes. Imaging today is more than a picture; it is data. It must be acknowledged that this is fully true for CT and MRI, which are almost invariably acquired and archived by standardized criteria, while this is not so true for ultrasonography, which is the most widely utilized imaging technique as the first approach to patients at risk for any liver disease and the most common technique detecting incident liver abnormalities. With this background, it is not surprising that imaging has been the most intense field of application of AI in hepatology, almost invariably requiring a CT or MRI investigation, enabling a prompt availability of retrospective data, and has been the most common and most rapidly growing topic of AI in hepatology, as reported in Fig. 1 and extensively reviewed by Nam et al. [4]. In particular, when dealing with radiology, a distinction should be made between two approaches: radiomics and broader AI. Radiomics consists of extracting a high number of quantitative features from medical images, while AI consists of advanced computational algorithms, potentially, but not exclusively, including quantitative features extracted from medical images that can accurately perform predictions for decision support. AI can be supervised or unsupervised; the difference is that one relies on labeled data to help predict outcomes, while the other processes unlabeled or raw data. Whatever approach is adopted, AI using radiology images has been addressed so far mainly to aid in reaching a more precise and reproducible diagnosis of focal liver lesions, to predict prognosis (i.e., survival or recurrence) in treated or untreated tumors, and to estimate histological or molecular characteristics of lesions. Moreover, a very active and promising field of interest is the extraction of radiomic features from MRI to support a more accurate diagnosis but, most importantly, to stratify patients for prognosis in rare diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis [11,12]. Another significant field of interest and potential application of AI is the analysis of histological microscopic slides. The source data, in this case, are still almost invariably not in a digital format since only very few laboratories have transitioned to a fully digitalized archive, despite the transition toward the whole slide imaging (WSI) technique, which includes the digitalization of the whole histological section via a digital scanner, as soon as the section is stained and thus before microscopic observation, has started. In the instance of not having a whole slide digital imaging approach, glass slides must be scanned for research purposes through a microscopic view and stored in a digital format [11]. To this end, it is worth mentioning that the formats for image acquisitions (e.g., resolution and compression) have not yet been universally standardized in pathology. However, it is conceivable to retrieve stained glass slides of the paraffin-embedded specimens, to be cut new and stained and subsequently digitally scanned and stored in a new-adopted standardized way. Therefore, both prospective and retrospective studies can be carried out in unremarkable modalities in multicentric investigations. It is worth reminding that pathological diagnosis, as well as radiological imaging interpretation, is significantly affected by interobserver variability, as we have already demonstrated for liver cancer assessment [13], pointing to the benefit of building a reproducible approach using digital tools. These factors contribute to histopathology being the second most common and growing field of application of AI in hepatology after radiology, as reported in Fig. 1 [4]. Currently, AI contributes to boosting the power of diagnostic imaging by providing automate processes of analysis and supporting pathologists or radiologists for diagnosis, and prognostic stratification is extremely important [14]. In fact, the capacity of AI-driven software to propose the possible diagnosis of one or another liver disease, thanks to the recognition of specific features, is already a reality in many applications and might soon be integrated into the clinical routine of specific referral centers, avoiding the possibility that the correct diagnosis may remain missed even for very long periods. 4 Application of robotics in liver surgery and transplantation The progress of AI allowed to improve the sensory capabilities of robots and to process information from the environment through the use of various tools (including cameras, microphones, lasers, and contact sensors) as well as processing techniques of sensory information based on DL. Despite this, robotics and AI are two distinct disciplines. The fundamental feature that distinguishes robotics from AI is the presence of the physical apparatus. This aspect poses great challenges in using robots in poorly structured environments, where it is difficult to manage interaction for safety and efficiency reasons. The evolution of robotics originated in response to humans\u2019 need for useful machines to assist them in physical work. Today, robotics constitutes an effective technology in surgery and it is widely used in the operating theaters of the most advanced hospitals. Notably, Giulianotti et al. performed the first donation at the University of Illinois (Chicago) in 2011, and then published the first liver resection using the da Vinci robotic system in 2012 [15]. Since then, the advantages and disadvantages of the robotic approach have been compared to the laparoscopic approach in various fields of liver surgery. The most cited ones are represented by the increased dexterity (thanks to articulated instruments that facilitate delicate dissections, such as near the hepatic hilum, and meticulous and precise sutures), the three-dimensional vision (also magnified and of greater stability), and the filtration of physiological hand tremor [16]. Conversely, laparoscopy shows disadvantages such as the lesser range and radius of movements that can be performed, thus offering worse ergonomics, and a longer learning curve. Moreover, the employment of Firefly fluorescence technology in surgical procedures displayed important advantages. As a matter of fact, such technology enables the acquisition of fluorescent signals together with normal light endoscopic pictures. Overall, this system allows to mantain the fluorescence vision and the use of indocyanine green in order to guide the resection or to perform an intraoperative cholangiography [17]. The interest of applying the robotic platform in liver transplant (LT) field raises from the proven advantages for both the recipient and the donor, especially in case of a living donor hepatectomy. In 2019, the \u201cExpert Consensus Guidelines on Minimally Invasive Donor Hepatectomy for Living Donor Liver Transplantation \u2013 From Innovation to Implementation as Standard\u201d established the non-inferiority of minimally invasive liver resections compared to open hepatectomy of the donor. In particular, advantages were found for the liver donor (in terms of donor safety and improvement of long-term donor quality of life) and recipient outcomes [18]. The world's largest laparoscopic Mininvasive Donor Hepatectomies (MIDH) series [19] estimates that approximately 60 pure laparoscopic donor hepatectomies are needed in one year to standardize the procedure. However, Chen et al. suggested that 15 hepatectomies could be sufficient in the robotic learning curve with respect to the 45 necessaries in the laparoscopic approach [20]. From a series by Broering et al., that performed a comparison with the open approach, blood loss appears to be reduced, as well as the postoperative hospitalization time (since it is basically a laparoscopically assisted surgery). By this way, patients could return to work sooner, with better quality of life and resumption of sexual activity [17]. Furthermore, the multi-input display technology TylePro allows to see the preoperative radiological images, the intraoperative ultrasound, and also the three-dimensional reconstructions, whose use was born from liver transplantology, on the same screen as the operating field. In the future, we could see an ever-greater autonomy of the robot through the integration of the presurgical data and 2D/3D images as well as the implementation of AI in surgery. Interestingly, the presence of a second console allows undertaking fully tutored teaching courses, with the possibility of constant and precise guidance over the timely interaction and/or intervention by a senior. This aspect is of paramount importance in a surgery field where both the teaching or tutoring and the protection of the donor patient are fundamental. Also, it is possible to practice thanks to dedicated programs (e.g., SimNow DaVinci Intuitive Surgical) enabling the simulation of surgical operations in 3D high definition and virtual reality. Hence, the robot fully satisfies the needs of teaching and learning in surgery. There are few centers where robotic hepatectomy living donor transplant programs are currently in place. In particular, the largest numbers (thanks also to greater seniority) are in Korea, Taiwan, and South Arabia. As a matter of fact, their growth took advantage from the presence on site of expert surgeons who brought their experience and tutored the transplant surgeons in the first years. In the future this could evolve toward distance teaching courses with remotely connected consoles exploiting the robotic platform with telesurgery. Moreover, centers aspiring to embark on a surgery program will be able to receive mentorship without the need for the physical presence of world experts in the field. In the last two years the first attempts at robotic liver implantation have been published, namely the first experience in 2021 by Lee et al. [19] and the efforts by Suh later in 2022 [21]. The authors highlighted that one of the major limitations of the robot, i.e. the absence of tactile feedback, was responsible for the potential graft damage during its manipulation of the suture threads [21]. This same Korean team successfully performed total hepatectomy using the robot [22]. Beyond the implementation of hugely complex gestures in robotics, in the future we will have a robot with the possibility of automation through the integration of presurgical data and 2D/3D images. In addition, the implementation of AI in surgery might became real, opening a new era in liver transplantation. 5 Applicability of AI in the transplant setting The evaluation of liver transplant recipients depends on a complex, multidimensional, and nonlinear relationship between variables pertaining to the donor, the recipient, and the surgical procedure. In the setting of liver transplantation, ML models have been developed to predict pre-transplant survival and management on the waiting list, including the risk of dying on the waiting list, to assess donor-to-recipient matching during the allocation process, and to predict the outcome [23,24]. Long-term outcome after solid organ transplantation is even more difficult to predict than in the early post-transplant period because it may also be influenced by conditions unrelated to the graft [24\u201326], such as infections, malignancies, and metabolic or cardiovascular diseases [27\u201329], together with recipient characteristics, intraoperative variables, postoperative variables, and immunological complications [30]. On the other hand, evaluating the pathology of the donor graft is one of the main issues for forecasting post-LT outcomes. In particular, marked macrovescicular steatosis is associated with early allograft dysfunction, primary nonfunction, and postreperfusion syndrome [25,31]. Several studies have focused on models quantifying steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, other morphological patterns, and the staging of liver fibrosis [26,32\u201334]. Once in use, these algorithms could play a significant role in overall donor liver assessment and in the standardization of the assessment of donor livers. The efficacy of liver transplantation is also hampered by organ shortage; the number of patients listed for LT exceeds the number of liver grafts available. This imbalance results in a significant proportion of patients who will die or be dropped out of the wait list (WL) while waiting for organ. To counteract the negative impact of organ shortages, notably in countries with medium to low organ donation rates, predictive models of mortality have found a major application in the field of LT. The Model for End-stage Liver Diseases (MELD) was developed and adopted in the USA 20 years ago [35], offering the highest priority for organ allocation to patients listed with the highest MELD score in an attempt to minimize the risk of death or drop out in the waitlist. Over the last decade, some emerging limitations and epidemiological changes in the clinical profile of LT candidates have been translated into a consistently declining precision of MELD, and individual graft allocation is increasingly questioned since mortality in the WL still averages an unacceptable 15\u201320% rate, peaking in some countries with indications to 30%. Liver offering schemes should therefore eagerly be revisited and moved toward precision medicine for refining liver transplantation indications and prioritization in the WL, both in decompensated cirrhosis and HCC [36]. Recent developments in AI have demonstrated the potential to address, at best, the complexity of the liver transplantation process and to increase the accuracy of classical statistical models in improving the prediction of mortality in WL compared to MELD-based systems [37]. In Bertsimas et al.\u2019s study, a state-of-the-art ML-based algorithm termed Optimized Prediction Of Mortality (OPOM) was designed. OPOM was derived from the retrospective analysis of the US Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) database, including decompensated cirrhosis served by MELD and HCC patients served by an exception MELD system. OPOM allowed a better description of patients\u2019 trajectories and identification of key root nodes as specific bilirubin values in patients with low MELD scores (figure available on request). As a result, OPOM outperformed MELD to predict 3-month mortality in the waitlist. Simulation studies suggested that OPOM had the potential for a nationwide reduction in WL mortality by 17.5% (i.e., 418 fewer deaths/year), peaking at 28\u201330% in patients with MELD scores between 16 and 25. In addition, a higher number of female candidates received transplants when OPOM allocation was utilized. Recently, a study used a combined approach for addressing the risk of dropout in patients listed for HCC in the OPTN database. Firstly, the authors focused on ML to identify independent predictors of dropout in this population. Then, they designed a Cox-model for dropout of HCC patients integrating six predictors identified by a random forest model [38]. The predictive model reached a c-index of 0.74 in the validation set. However, the training set was retrospective and did not consider critical predictors as tumor progression in the waitlist or response to therapy. These exploratory studies demonstrate the potential of AI to refine current predictive models both pre- and post-liver transplantation. According to current guidelines, a careful assessment of AI-based models on external prospective cohorts with simulation studies is mandatory to detect potential dysfunctions before adoption in real life. 6 Artificial Intelligence in hepatology: educational aspects Aside from ethical issues and the undoubtful perspectives of advancement in terms of precision medicine, diagnostic power, decision-making, and resource allocation and management, AI application in hepatology (and in medicine in general) also involves a series of issues and challenges regarding educational aspects. Indeed, to effectively use this methodology, there are several aspects to consider, even before considering its application on a large scale. This is evident by the fact that, even if AI already provides suited and practical approaches for the interpretation of medical data aimed at assisted diagnosis and personalized therapy, more and more in the field of hepatology, the most crucial obstacle to its practical application is the lack of specific background knowledge of the professional figures involved. In fact, it is emblematic that the most advanced aspect of AI application in hepatology is represented by radiomics, where already available image processing algorithms are adapted and applied to the medical diagnosis of liver tumors. Artificial vision generally has a well-established range of methodological standards that can be relatively easily processed by AI algorithms that already exist for image recognition and have been suitably \u201cadapted\u201d to recognize liver masses. Different is the case of other clinical/laboratory data, where the data collection, database management, information technology (IT) standards, and interpretation must be built practically from scratch with more challenging technical efforts. As previously reported, this aspect is particularly important when considering other \u201comics,\u201d in which a large amount of data needs to be implemented and interpreted correctly. Therefore, there is a need to prepare the new generations of medical and computer engineering students for this methodological revolution that will see the application of AI in medical problems more and more frequently. This point is essential, considering that these students are fully involved in the AI revolution and, thus, they need to be provided of the necessary scientific tools to \u201ccommunicate\u201d with each other in a productive manner. To this purpose, universities need to design dedicated courses in existing degree programs to teach the meaning and potential of AI and to create other degree programs from scratch, with the specific aim of training professionals in AI applied to medical sciences. In Italy, there are already some examples of this effort: the University of Salerno has already started a master's degree in \u201cComputer Engineering for Digital Medicine,\u201d as well as a specific course in \u201cArtificial Intelligence Applied to Medicine\u201d in the master's degree of Medicine and Surgery. 7 AI and ethical and legal aspects The integration of AI in clinical practice is rapidly increasing, and by relying on diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, clinicians are helped in the decision-making process to generate personalized treatments in many clinical settings [10,39]. However, there is still a debate on how AI assistance may affect medical performance; on the one hand, it can improve the sensitivity of clinical experts, while, on the other hand, it may lower their specificity. Studies showed that AI predictions based on explainable algorithms developed with a transparent model showed substantial benefits in settings such as liver transplantation (see dedicated section), antiviral therapy, and chemotherapy or in helping to anticipate strategic decisions to curb the local burden of pandemics such as COVID-19 [40\u201343]. On the other hand, the potential benefits of AI using ML systems are hampered by their black-box nature, which poses new important ethical and legal challenges spanning from data quality to medical\u2013legal questions arising from the incorporation of AI into clinical practice [10,39,44]. Because of the uncertainty generated by the lack of scrutiny of the recommendations provided by AI algorithms, clinicians will be unable to take appropriate steps to mitigate their concern that algorithm inaccuracy could lead to patient injury and medical liability [44\u201346]. Substantially, AI transforms the traditional therapeutic relationship between physicians and patients into a new triadic doctor\u2013machine\u2013patient relationship [44\u201348]. This revolution complicates the attribution of responsibility in malpractice lawsuit experts attempting to define a new legal framework that considers the AI role in healthcare, reducing as much as possible the existing heterogeneity of approaches across countries regarding medical liability [44\u201346,48,49]. Although a major aim of AI is to help reduce the risk of potential medical errors, paradoxically, an overreliance on AI systems could become dangerous, particularly when clinicians do not have the sufficient technological knowledge to understand the proper functioning of AI systems and their limits and safety (see dedicated section). Problems arise when it is difficult to rely on alternative systems that, in parallel, could provide information on the reliability of any particular result provided by AI since any AI-helped action will never be faultless. Experts extensively discussed the possibility of giving the AI systems a legal personhood so that they would become directly responsible for their own decisions and actions. However, if AI systems are recognized as a legal personhood with an active part in the decision-making process, it will be unacceptable to attribute any error to the human factor. The safety of the health care system relies on an organizational framework that warrants the well-functioning of all interdependent components and services: people, technology, and their interaction. Thus, the basic concept is that errors can derive from human behavior but also from malfunctioning of technologies, even though they are supposed to be \u201cintelligent.\u201d The Committee of Legal Affairs of the European Parliament stated that \u201cAI-systems have neither legal personality nor human conscience, and that their sole task is to serve humanity\u201d (https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2022-09/1_1_197605_prop_dir_ai_en.pdf) [44]. To date, giving AI a legal personality is considered inadequate because even supposed intelligent technologies are not substantially different from any other non-AI-based sophisticated technology already used (https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2022-09/1_1_197605_prop_dir_ai_en.pdf) [44]. However, since the experts\u2019 opinions always conflict when dealing with the most advanced knowledge and technology, AI liability issues when applied to healthcare assistance remain open. Accordingly, introducing AI systems in clinical practice prompts to build infrastructures to deal with critical issues such as data, quality, privacy and security, and safe data sharing [50\u201352]. Special attention should be paid to mitigating bias throughout the whole cycle of medical AI, from data collection to after deployment, particularly when hurting marginalized groups [53,54]. As predictive models developed by ML algorithms are based on data on which the whole AI system is built, one major target of AI ethics will be to address the biases of AI models associated with the quality and quantity of the data used [55]. Regulation and governance of medical AI requires the implementation of standardized safe AI practices and the establishment of a transparent reporting of the performance of AI systems. This policy will make clinicians less skeptical and more reliant on their AI-assisted decision-making without losing control over their own care because of the potentially unexplained AI results. Finally, since medical doctors are currently held liable when they deviate from the standard of care and patient injury occurs, a special concern is accountability, as it is not yet clear whether developers, sellers, or healthcare providers should be held accountable if a given AI system makes mistakes even after being clinically validated. 8 Conclusion In conclusion, to fully exploit the great potential of AI in healthcare, some crucial technological, educational, and ethical issues need to be addressed. Furthermore, all the societal complexities of AI applications need to be considered in proving their medical utility and economic value and in developing strategies for their wider applications. New liability frameworks and collaborative networks for multidisciplinary guidelines will facilitate the rapid implementation of AI systems for developing disease-customized AI-powered clinical decision support tools.

Guideline & Standard The standardized design and application guidelines: A primary-oriented artificial intelligence screening system of the lesion sign in the macular region based on fundus color photography Ocular Fundus Diseases Group of Chinese Ophthalmological Society; Expert Group for Artificial Intelligence Research, Development, and Application With the popularity and development of artificial intelligence (AI), disease screening systems based on AI algorithms are gradually emerging in the medical field. Such systems can be used for primary screening of diseases to relieve the pressure on primary health care. In recent years, AI algorithms have demonstrated good performance in the analysis and identification of lesion signs in the macular region of fundus color photography, and a screening system for fundus lesion signs applicable to primary screening is bound to emerge in the future. Therefore, to standardize the design and clinical application of macular region lesion sign screening systems based on AI algorithms, the Ocular Fundus Diseases Group of Chinese Ophthalmological Society, in collaboration with relevant experts, developed this guideline after investigating issues, discussing production evidence, and holding guideline workshops. It aimed to establish uniform standards for the definition of the macular region and lesion signs, AI adoption scenarios, algorithm model construction, dataset establishment and labeling, architecture and function design, and image data acquisition for the screening system to guide the implementation of the screening work. Keywords Artificial intelligence Screening of the lesion sign in the macular region Primary screening Fundus color photography Lesion sign analysis 1 Objective and significance of the development and application of the artificial intelligence screening system of the lesion sign in the macular region The macular region is primarily associated with visual functions such as fine vision and color vision, and the presence of lesions in the macular region is one of the major factors in vision loss. Because of the sensitivity of the macula, most damage to this area results in loss of central vision, which has a significant impact on the quality of life [1]. Early eye screening is an active mean of reducing the risk of lesions and avoiding vision loss. However, there are approximately 44,800 ophthalmologists nationwide, which means that, on average, one ophthalmologist provides care to approximately 31,250 Chinese people [2]. It can be seen that the extreme imbalance between supply and demand causes ophthalmologists in China facing tremendous work pressure in screening of ocular diseases, while some patients are unable to receive timely screening and treatment. Therefore, it is an inevitable trend to achieve the screening of large base populations for ocular diseases with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and information technology [3]. Fundus color photography is a convenient, noncontact ophthalmic examination for visualizing lesions of the optic nerve, retina, choroid, and refractive media of the eye and is currently the most cost-effective imaging modality for screening of fundus disease [4]. A wide variety of diseases can occur within the macular region, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central choroidal retinopathy, central exudative chorioretinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion [5]. Because of the limited lesion information provided by the fundus images, it is difficult to provide accurate diagnosis conclusions based on this single imaging examination. However, in the application scenario of primary-oriented screening, the screening system only needs to provide the conclusion as to whether there are suspicious lesion signs in the macular region. If certain lesion signs are present, the subject is considered to be at a risk of eye disease in the macular region and requires further examination at a hospital. Therefore, this guideline focuses on the design and application of a primary screening system for macular lesion signs. Fundus color photos collected under nonmydriatic conditions can satisfy the presentation of the examination region. Therefore, in general, the fundus color photos discussed in this guideline are collected under nonmydriatic conditions. With the development and application of big data-based AI technologies in the medical field, many high-quality AI algorithms have been successfully applied to assisted diagnosis, such as an AI algorithm being used to discriminate skin cancer from testing images [6] and to analyze lymph node metastasis of breast cancer [7]. In ophthalmology, Gargeya and Leng [8] trained an AI model using color fundus color photographs of 75,137 patients and achieved 94% sensitivity and 98% specificity in detecting diabetic retinopathy. Meanwhile, an AI screening system based on color fundus images demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in glaucoma screening [9]. At present, there are no unified standards for AI screening of lesion signs in the macular region in the world, including data sources, model construction, and clinical evaluation, thus limiting its clinical application. This guideline was inspired by the \u201cprovide Standardized Design and Application Guide of AI-Assisted Screening System for Glaucoma based on Fundus Photography in China (2020)\u201d [9] and \u201cApplication Guide of AI-Assisted Screening System for Diabetic Retinopathy Based Fundus Photography\u201d [10], referring to the artificial intelligence medical device industry standard [11\u201313] drafted by the National Institute for Food and Drug Control, and referring to the group standard issued by the China Association for quality inspection [14]. The guideline group developed standardized design and application guidelines for AI screening of lesion signs in the macular region for engineers, primary ophthalmologists, and other relevant personnel. The content of this guideline will be timely updated according to the new regulations and standards in the field of medical devices, as well as the new guidelines for diagnosing and treating diseases in the macular area. In particular, this guideline is intended to provide reference opinions for the definition of the lesion signs in the macular area, AI application scenarios, algorithm model building, the establishment of a dataset and labeling, screening system architecture and function design, and image data acquisition. Meanwhile, it can standardize the application of AI systems in the basic screening of lesion signs in the macular region and promote the overall improvement of the early screening level of fundus disease in China. 2 Definition of the macular region and lesion signs 2.1 Macular region According to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) [15], the macular region considered when discussing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a circular area with a radius of 2 times diameter of the optic disk (2 disc diameters (2 DD)) centered on the fovea. Meanwhile, it can be seen from the schematic diagram (Figure 1 ) that the macular region is almost tangential to the edge of the optic disk. In addition, anatomically, the macular region is defined as the area within 5.5 mm of the superior and inferior temporal vascular arches [16]. In conjunction with the above definitions, this guideline defines the macular region as a circular area centered on the fovea with a radius of the smallest of three values: 2DD, the minimum distance from the fovea to the superior and inferior vascular arches, and the minimum distance from the fovea to the edge of the optic disk. As shown in Figure 2 , the radius of the green circle is 2 DD; the radius of the blue circle is the minimum distance from the fovea to the edge of the optic disk, and the radius of the red circle is the minimum distance from the fovea to the superior and inferior vascular arches (main venous vessels). The circular area shown with solid lines in Figure 2(a-c) is the macular region defined in this guideline. 2.2 Definition of lesion signs in the macular region When screening for lesion signs of macular diseases, not only high-risk disease-related signs but also potential risk signs and disease areas are needed to be detected. The following is the definition of the lesion signs in the macular region in this guideline. (1) Drusen \u2265 125 \u00b5m in diameter [17]: 125 \u00b5m is equivalent to the diameter of the vein at the inferior temporal edge of the optic disk. Drusen are gel-like or translucent bodies that result from the deposition of abnormal metabolites of pigment epithelial cells. Drusen can be divided into 4 types [18]: 1) hard drusen refers to yellow dots with well-defined borders; 2) soft drusen are the lesions with less well-defined borders and fusion, accompanied by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) pigment changes; 3) the mixed type has the manifestations of both hard and soft; 4) degenerative drusen is an irregular map-shaped or halo-shaped atrophy area, which gradually expands and may appear white because of the calcification. (2) Geographic atrophy (GA) [17]: GA is defined as the loss of RPE, choriocapillaris, and photoreceptor cells. Single or multifocal chorioretinal atrophy areas with clear borders can be seen in the fundus color photography, in which the visibility of the choroid increased, and drusen with various sizes can be observed around it. (3) New blood vessels with at least one hemorrhage or exudation \u2265 125 \u00b5m in diameter [17]: Macular neovascularization (MNV) can be divided into 3 subtypes [19]: 1) Type 1 MNV represents areas of neovascular complexes originating from the choroid and terminating under the RPE; 2) Type 2 MNV: Neovascular originating from the choroid, passing through the RPE and growing under the retinal nerve fiber layer. The neovascular complex is located in the subretinal space, above the level of the RPE. Type 2 MNV can be observed as orange-red lesions in the fundus color photo; 3) Type 3 MNV is the extension of hyperreflectivity from the middle retina toward to the level of the RPE associated with intraretinal edema, hemorrhage, telangiectasis, and retinal detachment. Additionally, the subretinal neovascular membrane is manifested as an irregular circular lesion in the central fovea or a quadrant next to the central fovea, which is gray-white or yellow-white, and hemorrhage or halo can be seen around the lesion. Retinal neovascularization can be observed as small veins originating from the surface of the optic disk and retina, growing along the surface of the retina, and crawling into the vitreous, containing various amounts of fibrous tissue. (4) Exudation with at least one lesion \u2265 125 \u00b5m in diameter [20]. Hard exudation appears as single or multiple yellow-white globular materials in/under the retina. Soft exudation also known as cotton wool spots or leukoplakia appears as grayish-white spots with ill-defined boundaries. (5) Hemorrhage with at least one lesion \u2265 125 \u00b5m in diameter [20]. Hemorrhage can be divided into preretinal hemorrhage, superficial retinal hemorrhage, deep retinal hemorrhage, subretinal pigment epithelium hemorrhage, and simultaneous involvement of multiple layers according to the different retinal layers of the hemorrhage. Preretinal hemorrhage is bright red, boat-shaped, forming a typical liquid surface. Superficial retinal hemorrhages are mostly flames in bright red, and Roth's spots or small white dots in the center of the hemorrhagic lesions can be observed, which are platelet-fibrin thrombi produced when capillaries rupture [21]. Deep retinal hemorrhages are punctate, small, round, dark red patches that spread longitudinally along the course of the nerve. Subretinal hemorrhages are mostly dark red, and subretinal pigment epithelium hemorrhage are mostly brown-red. (6) Scar [20]: RPE and glial cells proliferate in the retinal space under the stimulation by exudation, resulting in the formation of fibrotic organized scar tissue, which appears as a round, tan-like plaque with a well-defined border [22]. (7) Pigment mottling: Pigment mottling can be divided into hyperpigmentation and depigmentation. Hyperpigmentation [20] appears as black or white spots with protrusions or branches and gradually gathers into black or white spider-like or osteocyte-like spots, which can be irregular strips. Depigmentation manifests as well-defined whitish or yellowish patches. (8) Macular hole [23] : A round or oval hole appears with a sharp edge in the macular area, occasionally irregular, and the size of the hole varies. (9) Epiretinal membrane [24]: A layer of translucent, thin or thickened gray avascular proliferative membrane can be seen in the macular area and nearby retinal surface, the retina appears folded, and the nearby retinal small blood vessels are tortuous. (10) Macular edema [17]: According to the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) [25], clinically significant macular edema (CSME) is defined as either retinal edema located at or within 500 \u00b5m of the center of the macular, hard exudates at or within 500 \u00b5m of the foveal center if associated with thickening of the adjacent retina, and extent of retinal thickening large, located in either quadrant of the macula, but with a partial invasion of the central macular region within 1DD. The manifestation of cystoid macular edema (CME) is diffusion or disappearance of foveal light reflection in the center of the macular, accompanied by retinal thickening [26\u201327]. Edema areas with enhanced or satin-like reflections can also be observed in CME. Advanced macular edema can be observed as a honeycomb or cystic appearance, the retinal thickness of the cyst wall is uneven, and internal separation and vascular shadows can also be observed. (11) Retinal detachment [28\u201329]: This includes rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), exudative retinal detachment, and traction retinal detachment. The retina in RRD with shallow detachment is pale in color and has a clear orange-red boundary. The retina with partial severe detachment appears grayish-white in color and protrudes into the vitreous cavity in a spherical shape. The retina with extensive detachment is undulating and flat along with tortuous and crawling blood vessels. Proliferative membranes can be seen above and below the staleness retinal detachment, which are irregular strips, and full-thickness folds are formed above the retinal surface. Exudative retinal detachment has a smooth surface without traction folds. Traction retinal detachment shows proliferative membranes or adherent organized tissue on the surface. (12) Intraocular space-occupying lesions have various manifestations, and other auxiliary examinations should be combined in clinical diagnosis to assist the diagnosis. (13) Others: Abnormalities of the macular region with signs not included in the categories above. The corresponding relationship between the above lesion signs and common diseases in the macular region is shown in Table 1 . It is worth noting that the guideline provides the definition of the above 13 lesion signs in the macular region. The designers should refer to this guideline and medical expert advice according to the product settings and actual needs when designing the lesion sign screening system. 3 Application of the AI algorithm in the screening system of the lesion sign in the macular region 3.1 Lesion sign classification The AI algorithm can provide conclusions about the presence or absence of lesion signs (defined in Section 2.2) in the fundus color photographs. Multiple lesion signs can be classified on the same fundus color photograph; therefore, the task is a multilabel classification task, i.e., the labels are not mutually exclusive [30]. As shown in Figure 3 , the AI model can discriminate the input images simultaneously for the presence of drusen, geographic atrophy, neovascularization, etc. In clinical applications, the classification results can be evaluated for each lesion sign, and evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa can be used. In general, compared with the reference criterion 1 1 Reference criterion [11]: diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, or benchmarks based on labeling procedures. Reference criterion could contain labels such as disease, physiological state or abnormality, and location as well as degree. of the presence or absence of the lesion signs in the clinical diagnosis report, the agreement is very good when Kappa is \u22650.80, good when the Kappa is between 0.61 and 0.80, moderate when the Kappa is between 0.41 and 0.60, barely acceptable when the Kappa is between 0.21 and 0.40, and considered almost nonexistent when the Kappa is \u2264 0.20 [31]. The performance goal of the AI algorithm is to achieve a very good agreement between the model prediction results and the professional diagnosis results, i.e., a Kappa of 0.8 or higher. 3.2 Lesion sign detection The AI algorithm can detect the specified lesion signs in the fundus color images. For example, for the lesion signs defined in Section 2.2, the AI model can locate the specific area from the image (Figure 4 ). The overlapping boxes in the image indicate the presence of more than one lesion in these boxes. 2 2 Please note that the target detection boxes are rectangular boxes, the actual lesions are in the rectangular box, but may not completely fill the whole rectangular box. The clinical application of the detection model is usually to visualize target lesions or tissues and assist ophthalmologists in observation. The effect evaluation of such applications is generally consistent with the evaluation indicators of object detection tasks in computer vision [32], which will be described in Section 4.5.2. 3.3 Lesion sign segmentation The AI algorithm can segment the specified lesion signs in the fundus color images. For example, for the lesion signs defined in Section 2.2, the AI model can segment the specific lesion contour from the image (Figure 5 ) [33]. The application of the segmentation model in the clinic is usually to visualize the target lesions or tissues and assist ophthalmologists in observation. The effect evaluation of this application is generally consistent with the evaluation index of segmentation tasks in computer vision [34], and the specific index will be introduced in Section 4.5.3. 3.4 Other applications of AI algorithms AI algorithms can be extended to disease dimension applications in addition to the analysis of lesion signs. This guideline provides two application references for disease classification and grading, which can be used as extended functions of the screening system. The lesion sign screening system does not need to include screening functions for these disease-based functions. 3.4.1 Disease classification The AI algorithm can discriminate whether the input image has a certain disease in the macular region, and the conclusion of this function is whether the subject has a disease or not, which is a binary classification task. It can be extended to a multiclassification task if it needs to be subdivided into specific disease types. Kappa between the results of the AI algorithm and the reference standard can measure the effectiveness of the AI algorithm in clinical application. 3.4.2 Disease grading AI algorithms can identify and grade diseases based on the input images (Figure 6 ). Disease grading is a multiclassification task. The evaluation in clinical applications is similar to disease classification, and evaluation measures such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Kappa can be used to measure the effectiveness of the application. 4 Algorithm construction and accuracy requirements for the AI screening system of the lesion sign in the macular region 4.1 Datasets and quality control As the basis for AI technology \u201cthinking\u201d and \u201cdeciding\u201d, data is the cornerstone of AI technology implementation. In the process of construction, verification, and production of the AI screening system, it is inseparable from the support of a large number of datasets. The fundus image collection process requires the shooting ophthalmologist/technician to strictly follow the standard image shooting requirements to avoid uploading unqualified images. This guideline classifies the quality of color fundus images into three categories: qualified, acceptable, and unqualified [35]. (1) Qualified: There is no quality problem in the image, and the shooting position meets the requirements of the color fundus image acquisition standard in this guide (Figure 7); (2) Acceptable: There are slight exposure problems (light leakage at the edges), small smears that do not affect interpretation, slight out-of-focus or blurred images, etc. (Figure 8); (3) Unqualified: Severe exposure abnormality, severe refractive interstitial opacity, large-scale contamination, missing information and irrelevant images, etc. (Figure 9) The guideline requires at least one image of each eye that can be analyzed by the AI system, and read by the doctor, and saved. The image must be in the correct position, with clear focus, suitable exposure, and no interstitial opacity. It should clearly display the retina, macular area, and optic disk structure. The quality requirements are as follows [36]: (1) Except for drusen, abnormal pigment or new blood vessels and other signs related to fundus macular disease, 90% of the blood vessels in the picture can be identified. (2) The main fundus structure is in the correct position. When using single-field image screening, the image field of view is no less than 45\u00b0 horizontally and vertically, the macular fovea and the optic disk are more than 2 optic disk diameters (DD) away from the image edge. When using double visual field images, the horizontal and vertical directions of each visual field are no less than 45\u00b0; the macular area image requires that the fovea is less than 1.5 DD away from the image center. The optic disk area image requires that the optic disk center is less than 1.5 DD away from the image center. The angle between the optic disk and the macular center line and horizontal line is not greater than 24\u00b0. (3) There are no dark and/or bright reflective areas that affect interpretation within the imaging. (4) Moderate exposure, no overexposure or underexposure. (5) No lens stains, eyelids and/or eyelashes and other occlusion shadows, no motion artifacts. (6) There are no other image errors such as the diseased eye is not displayed in the image or the color photo of the fundus is taken outside the fundus range. When the image does not meet the above quality requirements, the following adjustments are required. (1) The position of the main fundus structure is incorrect: Adjust the sitting posture of the subject, adjust the fixation point, confirm whether the patient has strabismus or other ocular abnormalities, and retake the image; (2) Overexposure, underexposure, and wrong focus: Adjust the exposure and focus settings of the fundus camera, and retake the image. If the image is too dark, the patient's pupil size should be confirmed, and the exposure time of the affected eye to bright light should be shortened accordingly, to reduce the inspection room brightness; (3) The pupil is too small to obtain satisfactory fundus images: Retake the fundus images after excluding the contraindications of mydriasis; (4) Obstruction of eyelids and eyelashes: Prompt the patient to open the eyelids during the photo-taking process, assist the patient to raise the eyelids if necessary, and retake the image; (5) Reflection of the iris: Remind the patient to stare at the fixed point of view and to look away, and retake the image; (6) Lens stains: Check and clean the lens; (7) Missing information: Confirm that the image information is stored completely, re-shoot and store the image; (8) External eye and nonfundus images: Prevent uploading of irrelevant images such as images with the lens cover not opened, environmental images shot by mistake, and external eye inspection images. This guideline recommends that the collection of images in the dataset should consider the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: (1) Color photos of fundus taken with a single/double field of view. (2) The image quality is qualified or acceptable. Exclusion criteria: (1) The image quality is unqualified. (2) Treatment traces can be observed in the image. 4.2 Dataset establishment This guideline classifies the datasets involved in the design and application of screening systems into three major categories (as shown in Figure 10): datasets for the model establishment, validation, and for the clinical trials. In the model construction dataset, the tuning set can be called the validation set, the test set can be called the internal test set, and the datasets for the model validation, and the clinical trials can be called the external test set. Duplicate samples or duplicate examinees should not appear in the different subdatasets. In addition, the inclusion of medical data requires ethical approval and desensitization in advance. Guide users can selectively refer to the relevant contents of this guide according to the actual application scenarios and conditions. 4.2.1 Source of the dataset for model establishment The purpose of the model establishment dataset is to provide labeled data for model training, tuning, and self-testing so that the model can learn the optimal parameters and achieve good screening results. Because of the differences in shooting angles, imaging colors, and resolution of different cameras, it is necessary to collect data involving multiple camera equipment and under multiple shooting conditions to improve the generalization ability 3 3 Generalization ability: It refers to the ability of artificial intelligence algorithms to adapt to fresh samples. The purpose of machine learning in artificial intelligence techniques is to learn the features implied behind the data, and the ability of trained models to give suitable outputs for datasets other than those with the learned features is called generalization ability. of the AI model. With reference to the guidelines for the application of AI systems for diabetic retinopathy [10] and glaucoma [9], this guideline recommends collecting data from no less than three medical institutions (to satisfy the diversity of acquisition environments and personnel operations) and no less than three devices (to satisfy the diversity of acquisition devices). Since this guideline targets the Chinese population eye screening application scenario, the data source for model establishment should belong to the Chinese population. Meanwhile, the samples in the dataset should cover multiple ethnic groups, regions, and ages. In the process of AI model establishment, the source of the dataset should include various public datasets (such as hospitals at all levels, ophthalmology centers, epidemiological survey data, public data, etc.), but the data should comply with the labeling method of Section 4.3, and must be relabeled if needed. All data acquisition must be approved by the ethical review committee of the relevant units. Note that when collecting data in the different medical institutions, samples from the previous cohort should be randomly selected to construct the dataset, and high-quality images should not be selected by manual intervention. 4.2.2 Partition for the model establishment dataset This guideline suggests dividing the model establishment dataset using the leave-one-out method [37], which directly divided the dataset into three mutually exclusive sets, including training set, tuning (validation) set, and test set. Referring to the data division ratio used in the paper on diabetic retinopathy identification published by Google in the journal of JAMA [38]: the total ratio of training and tuning sets was 91.56% and the ratio of test sets was 8.35%. This guideline recommends that the proportion of training and tuning sets should be around 90% and the proportion of test sets be at least 10% in the model establishment dataset. The division of training and tuning sets can be divided into an 8:1 or 7:2 ratio according to the commonly used in AI technology applications. It is worth noting that the test set here is only used for self-testing in the model establishment session. In addition to the division of the training, tuning, and test sets, the screening system can divide the training (including tuning) and test sets based on the model training characteristics. It should be noted that the dataset partitioning should be consistent with data distribution among the training, validation, and test sets [39], i.e., the proportion of samples in each category should be consistent, and the categories here should be considered as lesion signs, subject age and gender category, image acquisition institution, and camera type. Meanwhile, the data distribution of the test set should be in line with the expected application scenarios, and multiple fundus images of the same subject should be assigned to one of the training set, validation set, or test set, i.e., multiple fundus images of the same subject should not be divided into different subdatasets. 4.2.3 Quantity of the samples in the model establishment dataset From the division of the model establishment datasets in the previous section, it is clear that this guide recommends that the test set should account for 10% of the total number of datasets. In the following, this guideline will derive the number of images needed for each lesion sign category in the test set based on the expected effect of the AI model and thus provide suggestions for the total number of model establishment datasets. The calculation of the required sample size for each category is based on the confidence interval method [40] of the assessment index: (1) N = [ Z 1 \u2212 a ] 2 P ( 1 \u2212 P ) \u0394 2 where Z is the Z statistic at the confidence level, \u0394 is the allowable error, P is the expected assessment index (sensitivity or specificity), and N is the required sample size. Setting the significance level \u03b1 = 0.05 (two-sided), Z 1 \u2212 \u03b1 = 1.96 , and the allowable error \u0394 for the expected assessment indicator is set to 5%. (1) When the expected sensitivity of the AI model is 90% and the specificity is 90%, the minimum positive or negative sample size corresponding to the samples belonging to each lesion sign is (2) N = 1.96 2 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 0.9 ) 0.05 2 \u2248 138 that is, in the test set, at least 138 samples are required for each of the lesion sign and no-target sign categories defined in Section 2.2. (2) Similarly, when the sensitivity and specificity of the AI model is expected to be 85%, a minimum of 196 samples are required for a single category in the test set. Referring to the above calculations, the guideline recommends that the number of samples in the test set of the model establishment dataset involving each type of lesion sign defined in Section 2.2 be at least 200. Referring to the guidelines for the standardized design and application of glaucoma-assisted screening systems [9] (screening positive samples: normal fundus samples: other eye disease samples = 2:7:1), it is recommended 4 4 On the basis of ensuring at least 200 positive samples for each category, it is very difficult to collect samples from normal fundus and other eye diseases that meet the epidemiological distribution. Therefore, suggestions are made on the number of samples from normal fundus and other eye diseases in this guide. On this premise, the guidelines also suggest that the sample size of each type in the collected dataset should meet the epidemiological distribution as much as possible. that the test set should contain at least 700 clinically normal fundus images and at least 100 fundus images with other eye diseases. 5 5 If the designed screening system can screen multiple lesion signs, samples with different signs can be \"samples with other fundus diseases\". On the basis of the proportion of the test set in the total dataset, it is deduced that the samples of the total dataset of the model establishment that meet the various types of lesion signs defined in Section 2.2 are at least 2,000. It is recommended that the total dataset contains at least 7,000 clinically normal fundus images and at least 1,000 fundus images with other fundus diseases. Please note that multiple lesion signs appearing on the same image are acceptable. In addition, this guideline recommends that the number of samples in each type of subdataset be evenly distributed according to the collection institution and machine model. It is recommended to refer to the incidence rates of macular regional diseases in different sexes and different age groups when considering the gender and age distribution of each type of sample in the dataset. 4.2.4 Source and quantity of the samples in the model validation dataset To verify the effect of AI models, except for using test sets for validation during model establishment, collecting additional datasets is recommended to test the effect after the model establishment. The data collected in this session are required to be consistent with the model establishment dataset and meet the requirements of the diversity of collection environments, collector operations, the diversity of collection devices as well as ethnicity, region, age, etc. This dataset can be acquired from the public dataset but should be confirmed using the labeling method of Section 4.3, and needs to be relabeled if needed. All data acquisition is subject to the approval of the ethical review committee of the relevant unit. To meet the validation of the generalization ability of the screening system, the acquisition environment, acquisition personnel, and acquisition equipment involved in this dataset should be as different as possible from the model establishment dataset above. As shown in Figure 10, the model validation datasets can consist of multiple compositions, and these datasets can be used for validation of the screening system by multiple vendors or third-party organizations. The quantity of the validation datasets should be established by the vendor and third-party organizations based on the testing requirements. The quantity requirement can also be referred in Section 4.2.3. The number of samples in the prepared dataset involving each type of lesion sign as defined in Section 2.2 is at least 200, and the dataset should also contain at least 700 clinically normal fundus images and at least 100 fundus images containing other fundus diseases. To validate the screening effect of images with various qualities, samples with two image qualities of qualified and acceptable are required in the model validation dataset. The image quality is judged by the image quality criteria; please refer to Section 4.1 in this guideline. According to the confidence interval sample size calculation formula (1), there should be at least 200 images of each quality in the validation dataset. The image quality label and the lesion sign label are present simultaneously on each image. 4.2.5 Source and quantity of samples in datasets for clinical trials Clinical trials are designed to validate the performance of AI models; therefore, this guideline recommends that clinical trials should be designed using a prospective, paired, multicenter, and target value approach. The main bases for the design are the Quality Management Standards for Medical Device Clinical Trials [41], the Guidelines for the Registration Review of Artificial Intelligence Medical Devices [39], and the Approval Points for Deep Learning-Assisted Decision of Medical Device Software [42]. (1) Multicenter: Clinical trials of medical devices should be conducted in 3 or more clinical trial institutions, i.e., multi-center clinical trials. The clinical trial centers are different from the sources of the datasets for model construction, and it is recommended that the sample number of each category in each center be balanced. (2) Paired: Fundus color photographs of the same subject in the trial should be read using both the AI model and the control method (central reading), i.e., paired design. (3) Target value method: The amount of the data collected in the clinical trials needs to meet the conditions to verify whether the sensitivity and specificity of AI models applied in clinical scenarios meet the expected targets. (4) The clinical trial dataset used to test the clinical effect of the AI model should reflect the quality and diversified distribution of the data in the real world and ensure that the sample distribution conforms to the clinical reality and has no intersection with the dataset used in the model establishment. In clinical trials, the size of samples required should be consistent with the amount of data in the test set calculated in Section 4.2.3, i.e., this guideline recommends that clinical trials provide a dataset involving at least 200 images of each lesion sign as defined in Section 2.2, at least 700 images of clinically normal fundus images, and at least 100 fundus images with other fundus diseases. Similar to the model validation dataset introduced in Section 4.2.4, in order to evaluate the screening effects of images of different qualities, clinical trial datasets should contain qualified images and acceptable images. According to the formula (1) for calculating the sample size of the confidence interval of evaluation indicators, there should be at least 200 images of each quality in clinical trial datasets. It is worth noting that this guideline recommends that the datasets used for model testing and validation conform to the data distribution of the intended application scenario. According to the epidemiological investigation of macular lesions [43\u201345], among the lesion signs mentioned in Section 2.2, the lowest prevalence was pigment proliferation (0.10%), and the highest prevalence was drusen and geographic atrophy (7.21%). If the number of images of pigment proliferation signs in the clinical trial dataset is 200, the number of images corresponding to the two signs of drusen and geographic atrophy should reach 14,420, and the number of images without macular lesions should be at least 160,000, which is hard to achieve. Therefore, this guideline suggests that on the premise that \u201cthe dataset provided by clinical trials involves at least 200 images of each pathological sign defined in Section 2.2, at least 700 images of clinical normal fundus, and at least 100 fundus images of other fundus diseases\u201d, the number of samples corresponding to the categories of lesion signs with high prevalence and cases without macular lesions should be increased as far as possible. 4.3 Annotation for datasets The annotation of the above datasets and the reading of the clinical trial datasets can be done in the way described in this section, and the annotated results are used as the \u201creference standard\u201d for each task. 4.3.1 Annotation model In accordance with the annotation and quality control specifications for fundus color photographs [14], this guideline recommends the use of a labeling model of 3 + 2 + 1 or 3 + 2 + 2, i.e., 3 labeling physicians + 2 senior physicians + 1 or 2 arbitration experts. The labeling physicians are medical professionals who are licensed to practice medicine or have passed the relevant professional training. The senior physicians are professionals who have worked in the field of ocular disease for 5 years or more, and the arbitration experts are higher-level experts with the title of an associate chief physician or above. If two of the three labeling physicians do not have identical labeling results, two senior physicians should be introduced. If the two senior doctors have the same labeling, this labeling result shall be regarded as the final annotation; if disagreement still exists, one or two arbitration experts shall be introduced. The arbitration experts provide the final annotation after the review. 4.3.2 Annotation staff Annotation staff should receive data labeling training including labeling software operating procedures, labeling protocols, etc. The specific contents of the labeling training and assessment are as follows. (1) Training content: a) To standardize the labeling process, the labeling staff should be trained by the system engineer before using the labeling system. b) To standardize the understanding of the rules of fundus image labeling, training in labeling lesion signs should be conducted by an ocular disease specialist (chief physician of a tertiary care hospital for ocular disease). (2) Assessment mechanism: a) The evaluation was carried out by a practical operation method: A certain number of evaluation images will be randomly selected from each lesion sign case, and the experts and the labeling physicians are asked to label the evaluation images with the specified forms (Section 4.3.3 for details), and the consistency rate of the annotations obtained by the labeling physicians and experts will be calculated. b) Assessment index: The labeling consistency rate is required to be no less than a certain percentage. According to the ocular specialists, this guideline recommends that the labeling consistency rate between qualified labeling physicians and ocular specialists should not be less than 80%. 4.3.3 Annotation procedure The labeling object is a fundus color image, and the labeling form should be set according to the function of the screening system, as shown in Table 2 . The screening system can contain multiple functions at the same time; therefore, various labeling forms should be viable. The following three important elements are included in the labeling processing: treatment traces determination, image readability determination, and specific annotation procedure. Before labeling, the annotation system administrator should assign the user's name and password to the staff. Then, the staff can log in to the annotation system and start labeling. (1) Treatment traces determination: If treatment traces are found, such as laser point, silicone oil filling, gas filling, external pressure/ring ligation, etc., the image does not need to be labeled and directly removed. (2) Image readability determination: Image shooting quality will affect readability. If more than 1/3 of the macular area is unreadable due to underexposure or overexposure, it is suggested that the image should not be labeled and directly removed. (3) The complete labeling process is as follows (Figure 11). 4.3.4 Annotation evaluation During the labeling process, this guide recommends assessing the quality of the annotation. The assessment can be performed from both correctness and repeatability perspectives. The evaluation process is similar to that of the annotation staff assessment, in which a certain number of images are randomly selected from the annotated images for evaluation (it is recommended to contain 200 samples), and the ocular specialist is asked to label the selected images. Correctness assessment: The annotation results of the selected images are compared between the annotation staff and the ocular specialist. If the consistency rate reaches the preset proportion, the annotation is considered acceptable. Repeatability assessment: The selected images are repeatedly put into the annotation data pool and annotated by the annotator for a second time. Then, the two labeling results of each selected image are compared and evaluated. If the consistency rate reaches the preset ratio, the labeling repeatability of the annotation is considered to be qualified. For unqualified images, the existing labels should be erased and put back into the annotation data pool for re-annotation, and the unqualified labeling physicians should be retrained. 4.4 Algorithm model construction In this guideline, the AI screening system of the lesion sign in the macular region is responsible for providing the conclusion of the presence or absence of lesion signs, as well as the visual presentation for segmentation or localization of specific lesion signs. During the model construction process, the training set images and the corresponding annotations are input into the model to learn the mapping relationship between the image features and the target task and update the model parameters [37]. Before the training process, a designed algorithm is required to perform preliminary image preprocessing, such as image foreground extraction, image scaling, and image tone enhancement, to reduce the sample differences between models by normalizing the size and tone of the input images. At the same time, the algorithm can flip, rotate, or crop the original image randomly, as well as adjust the image color and shade level to enhance the diversity of training samples. In addition, the algorithm can also introduce random noise to the images during the training process to enhance the robustness of the model against noise and sample attacks [46]. After the training, the model is optimized on the tuning set. After tuning, the model can be tested and the performance can be evaluated on standard test sets. 4.5 Evaluation metric for AI models Section 3 introduces the application scenarios of AI algorithms in the screening of lesion signs in the macular region, including classification of lesion signs, detection of lesion signs, segmentation of lesion signs, and extended disease grading and diagnosis. This section describes the evaluation metrics for the models according to different application scenarios. 4.5.1 Lesion sign classification Lesion sign classification belongs to the multilabel classification task, and the mainly used model evaluation metrics including sensitivity, specificity, miss rate, accuracy, F 1 score, area under the curve (AUC), Kappa, etc., and the specific evaluation metrics are defined and calculated as shown below [11-12]. Sensitivity (Sen), also known as recall (R), is the proportion of true positive samples to all positive samples. S e n = T P T P + F N Specificity (Spe) is the proportion of true negative cases to all negative cases. S p e = T N T N + F P Miss rate (MR) is the proportion of positive samples not found in the test to all positive samples. M R = 1 \u2212 T P T P + F N Precision (Pre), also known as a positive predictive value, is the proportion of true-positive samples to those predicted positively by the model. P r e = T P T P + F P Negative prediction value (NPV), is the proportion of true negative samples to those predicted as negative by the model. N P V = T N T N + F N Accuracy (ACC), is the proportion of samples correctly predicted by the model to the total sample. A C C = T P + T N N F 1 score is a summed average of recall and precision. F 1 = 2 \u00d7 P \u00d7 R P + R The Jorden index, also known as the correct index, assumes that false negatives and false positives are equally harmful. The Jorden index is the sum of sensitivity and specificity minus one, and a larger index indicates better screening. J o r d e n i n d e x = S e n + S p e \u2212 1 AUC: The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Where ROC is the curve formed by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the screening system on the test set at a set of predefined thresholds, resulting in a set of (1-specificity, sensitivity) operating points that are connected in sequence. The Kappa coefficient is an indicator used to evaluate the agreement of the screening system with the reference criterion. K a p p a = N ( T P + T N ) \u2212 ( R 1 C 1 + R 2 C 2 ) N 2 \u2212 ( R 1 C 1 + R 2 C 2 ) where R 1 is the sum of true positive and false positive cases, R 2 is the sum of false negative and true negative cases, C 1 is the sum of true positive and false negative cases, C 2 is the sum of false positive and true negative cases, and N is the sum of sample cases. 4.5.2 Lesion sign detection The results of the localization task can be presented in two ways: one is to output the coordinate information of the target centroid, and the other is to output the information of the box of the region where the target is located. For the model that outputs only a one-point coordinate, the evaluation metric is usually chosen as the average Euclidean distance; for the model that outputs a target box, the evaluation metric is usually the intersection over union and the mean average precision. Mean Euclidean distance (MED): M E D = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N ( ( x i \u2212 x i 0 ) 2 + ( y i \u2212 y i 0 ) 2 ) where ( x i , y i ) is the model prediction coordinate, and ( x i 0 , y i 0 ) is the reference criterion. Intersection over union (IoU) measures the extent to which the prediction box overlaps with the reference criterion. I o U ( X , Y ) = | X \u2229 Y | | X \u222a Y | = T P T P + F N + F P Mean average precision (mAP) is used to calculate the average accuracy of all kinds of object detection in multiple object detection tasks [47]. The calculation process is as follows. In the object detection task, the model will provide the probability value corresponding to a certain object class in the target box, which is called confidence. When the confidence is higher than threshold t h c o n f i d e n c e , the current prediction results are retained. Then, the IoU of the reference criterion of this target box and the predicted box will be calculated. When the IoU is greater than threshold t h I o U and the predicted category in the predicted box is consistent with that in the reference criterion, the prediction result is considered a true positive. The rest are considered false positives. By changing the confidence threshold t h c o n f i d e n c e from large to small, the corresponding precisionp and recallr of the predicted results can be calculated, and the precision-recall curve can be drawn. The area under the curve is denoted as average precision (AP) [48]. After obtaining the AP of each category, the mAP of the multiple object detection task can be obtained: m A P = \u2211 i = 1 K A P i K where K is the number of the object categories contained in the detection task and A P i is the AP value of the prediction result of the ith category object. 4.5.3 Lesion sign segmentation The evaluation indices of the segmentation model mainly include the DICE coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, IoU, sensitivity, specificity, and so on. Since the segmentation task can be regarded as a binary classification task that divides image pixels into foreground and background, sensitivity and specificity can be used to evaluate the discrimination effect of the segmentation model for each pixel. The DICE coefficient refers to the proportion of the intersection of the segmented contour and the reference criterion contour to the average value of the segmented contour and the reference standard contour: D I C E ( X , Y ) = | X \u2229 Y | 1 2 ( | X | + | Y | ) = 2 \u00d7 T P ( T P + F N ) + ( T P + F P ) where | X \u2229 Y | represents the intersection between X and Y, and | X | and | Y | represent the number of pixels of region X and region Y. Jaccard coefficient: the proportion of the intersection of the segmented contour and the reference criterion to the union of the segmented contour and the reference criterion, also known as the intersection ratio (IoU): J a c c a r d ( X , Y ) = I o U ( X , Y ) = | X \u2229 Y | | X \u222a Y | = T P T P + F N + F P 4.5.4 Extended function - disease grading and diagnosis For AI models, both disease grading and disease diagnosis are classification tasks, so the evaluation metrics can refer to those listed in Section 4.5.1. 4.5.5 Comprehensive evaluation metric Screening compliance rate: The ratio of positive cases predicted by the model to those determined by the ophthalmologist reading. Repeatability requirements: The same ophthalmologist/technician deploying and running the AI-assisted screening system on different servers that meet the requirements of the configuration environment should be able to reproduce the predicted results for the same images. Reproducibility requirements: Different ophthalmologists/techni-cians deploy and run AI-assisted screening systems in the same configuration environment at different time periods. For the same image, it should be able to reproduce its prediction results. Robustness requirements: The AI-assisted screening system should have stable performance for multi-center, multimodel, and multiparameter clinical data, and the statistical performance changes of the main metrics are recommended to be controlled within a certain range. The specific range value depends on the function of the screening system and the corresponding medical device standards and regulations. 5 Application standard of the AI screening system of the lesion sign in the macular region 5.1 Type of the AI screening system The offline version of the AI system can be installed on a computer or mobile electronic device and can perform intelligent screening of the macular lesions based on the input fundus photographs without a network, as well as generate screening reports. Referring to the guidelines for the application of AI screening systems for diabetic retinopathy [10], the time of the offline version of the AI system from the input of color fundus photos to the output of the screening results should be controlled within 1 min. It is recommended that the application organizations should retain the offline version of the screening system. The online version of the AI system is suitable for application organizations with a nice network. The desensitized fundus color photos need to be uploaded to the cloud via a network. Then the cloud server should perform intelligent screening of macular area lesion signs and send results back. Afterward, the report combining the information of the examinees is generated for users to download. The online version of the system has high requirements for hardware equipment, network transmission speed, and transmission security. Referring to the guidelines for the application of AI-assisted screening systems for diabetic retinopathy [10], the time of the online version of the AI system from the input of color fundus photos to the output of screening results should be controlled within 5 min. 5.2 Architecture and functionality of the AI screening system The framework of the AI screening system should include patient management, image display, image quality assessment, AI screening result generation, the input of specialist's diagnostic opinion, and report generation. The function of the screening system depends on the actual application requirements, including the identification of the presence and grade of lesion signs, and the provision of the location and specific contour of lesion signs. The deployment of the system should be adapted to the environment and network conditions of the corresponding organization. 5.2.1 Patient management The system allows the entry, modification, and viewing of patients' information. The examinee's information includes basic personal information (such as name, age, gender, medical ID, etc.) and relevant examination information (such as visual acuity, intraocular pressure, blood pressure, etc.). Detailed patient information is provided for doctors to verify that image information matches patient information without errors. 5.2.2 Image display The fundus images of the right and left eyes are displayed. The images cannot be edited but can be zoomed in and translated to facilitate physician analysis. 5.2.3 Image quality assessment This guideline recommends a quality scoring scheme to cover the four components of shot location, brightness, clarity, and whether the information is missing (see Section 4.1 for details) to determine whether the image quality can be used to observe or detect lesion signs in the macular region and also to provide an assessment of image quality (qualified, acceptable, unqualified). 5.2.4 AI screening The most important module of the screening system is AI screening. According to the designed screening function, the system developer needs to train the corresponding AI model to complete the screening task. The output results of the AI model will be presented in the final report provided by the screening system and should be marked \u201cthe results are from the AI screening system\u201d. The form of screening results presented in the report depends on the preset function of the system, including printing whether the subject is a referral case, printing what specific lesion signs appear in the image, showing the location or profile of lesion signs, etc. 5.2.5 Specialist's diagnostic opinion The specialist reviews the AI screening results and provides a diagnostic opinion. Referring to the existing guidelines for the application of AI-assisted screening systems at home and abroad [9], the specialist's diagnosis opinion is recommended to be provided within 24 h. This guideline recommends that the input module for expert-recommended diagnostic opinions be retained in the screening system. 5.2.6 Report generation The screening report is provided to the examinees in an electronic or a paper form, and the content should cover the screening scope of this guideline and comply with the standards and specifications for writing the main health examination report [49]. 5.2.7 Screening system deployment The offline version of the AI screening system is deployed on a local device, and the online version is deployed remotely using the cloud. 5.3 Hardware requirements for the color fundus image acquisition The AI screening system of the lesion sign in the macular region recommends the application of semiautomatic or fully automatic nonmydriatic flat color fundus cameras. The parameters of each index should refer to the following requirements: (1) Focusing: the machine supports automatic focusing; (2) Exposure: the machine supports automatic exposure; (3) Field angle: when using a single field of view, the horizontal direction and the vertical direction \u226545\u00b0 [35]. When using double fields of view, the horizontal direction and the vertical direction of each field of view \u226545\u00b0; (4) The minimum pupil diameter that can be photographed: the minimum pupil diameter of the standard mode is about 4 mm, and the minimum pupil size of the small pupil mode is about 3.3 mm; (5) Resolution: The minimum resolution within the field of view is not less than the industry standard requirements of fundus cameras [50]; (6) Refractive compensation range: \u2265 \u00b115 D; (7) Internal fixation point: The built-in fixation point of the fundus camera can be adjusted to at least 3 positions corresponding to the center of the field of view, including the center of the optic disk, the center of the macula, and the midpoint of the line connecting the optic disk and the macula, and the fixation point can be specified as needed; (8) Image storage format: Support lossless compressed TIFF format or lossless compressed PNG format, support compressed JPEG format (compression ratio not greater than 10:1), and support DICOM format; (9) Image shooting pixels: No less than 18 million pixels. 5.4 Standard of the image acquisition field of view (1) Single-field imaging method: The midpoint of the line connecting the macula and the optic disk is the center of the field of view, and the imaging covers at least 45\u00b0 of the retinal area [35] (Figure 12). (2) Double-field imaging method: Field 1 takes the fovea as the center of the field of view, and the imaging covers at least 45\u00b0 of the retinal area; Field 2 takes the optic disk as the center of the field of view, and the image covers at least 45\u00b0 of the retinal area and can cover the area of 2 DD around the optic disk. The optic disk, the macular area, and the first branch of the upper and lower retinal vascular arches can be clearly observed (Figure 13). The quality of the captured images needs to be judged according to the data quality control standards in Section 4.1, and the unqualified images need to be reshot. 5.5 AI screening scheme 5.5.1 Quality assessment for the color fundus images The AI system could evaluate the image quality before analysis. This part is about evaluating the quality of the captured image from the three perspectives of shooting position, sharpness, and readability according to the image quality control standards. (1) Shooting position: Check whether the deflection or displacement in each area of the image. (2) Sharpness: Check the focusing and whether the structures such as the optic disk surface, retinal main vessels, retinal branch vessels, macular, and lesion are clearly discernible. (3) Readable range: Check whether the optic disk, macular area, and upper and lower vascular arch areas are completely included in the field of view and whether there are eyelashes or other foreign objects blocked. Image quality can be divided into three categories: qualified, acceptable, and unqualified. If the quality of the images during the test is qualified, the follow-up AI screening analysis will be carried out normally; if the image quality is acceptable, the operator can choose to continue the AI screening analysis, but it should be marked \u201cImage quality deviation, the results are only for reference\u201d in the \u201cScreening Results\u201d. In addition, the operator can also choose to retake the image and if the image quality is unqualified, the operator must recollect the fundus image, if the image quality is not up to standard after three shots, the shooting fails, and subsequent AI screening and analysis cannot be performed. 5.5.2 Guidelines and principles for screening protocols 5.5.2.1 Guidance criteria for segmentation/localization of lesion signs in the macular region For the lesion signs listed in Section 2.2 (drusen, geographic atrophy, neovascularization, exudation, hemorrhage, scarring, pigment mottling, etc.), it is recommended that the AI screening system should provide a visual display of the lesion segmentation results. To facilitate the doctor to observe the lesions, this guideline recommends that the visualization method provided by the screening system is the edge display of the lesion segmentation or the detection box display of the lesion localization. 5.5.2.2 Guidelines for the detection of lesion signs in the macular region According to the definition of lesion signs listed in Section 2.2, it is recommended that the AI screening system provide the judgment results of whether the above lesions exist in the input fundus color photos. 5.5.2.3 Guidelines for screening the lesion signs in the macular region The doctor first refers to the AI results, corrects the parts that are not approved, and then explains the content and significance of the AI screening results to the patient in detail. At the same time, it is necessary to explain that the AI-assisted diagnosis is not equivalent to the diagnosis of a professional doctor. Doctors can provide professional diagnosis and treatment recommendations for the next step based on the results of AI screening, combined with the subject's vision [51]and clinical manifestations: (1) For subjects without lesion signs in the macular region (low risk, no referral required), it is recommended for them to have a fundus health examination once a year; (2) For subjects who are suspected to have 1 lesion sign in the macular region (medium risk, referral recommended) or who cannot be clearly determined to contain the lesion sign mentioned in Section 2.2 only based on the fundus color image, it is recommended to conduct a further examination; (3) For subjects with at least one lesion sign in the macular region (high risk, confirmed referral), it is recommended to go to the hospital for a thorough examination as soon as possible. 5.6 Report requirements (1) Basic information of the examinee: medical record number/medical ID, name, age, gender, and eye of the examinee; (2) Ophthalmology-related information: vision, intraocular pressure, history of ophthalmic diseases, history of ophthalmic treatment (surgery, medication, etc.); (3) Image acquisition information: date, equipment model, imaging range, and image storage format; (4) Information about the screening system: the type and version of the algorithm, the model applicable to the algorithm, and the date of image analysis; (5) Image evaluation: image quality; (6) AI screening results: the diagnosis of the inspected eye, the probability of being sick or healthy, and the description of the pathological changes in the macular region. Specifically, it is recommended that the results should include the presence or absence of the lesion signs listed in Section 2.2 and the segmentation/localization display of the lesion signs; (7) The opinion of the specialist on the proposed diagnosis; (8) The description of rights and responsibilities. 5.7 Data storage The storage of the fundus color images needs to meet the data storage security, the efficiency of management, and the convenience of HIS [52], PACS [53], and AI-assisted screening systems in use. The specific requirements are as follows. (1) The model construction dataset can be stored by the development organization, the model validation dataset can be stored by the third-party testing organization, and the clinical trial dataset can be stored by each trial center; when the model is tested by the third-party testing organization and the clinical trial center, blind testing is recommended, i.e., the dataset does not flow into the model development organization; (2) PNG, JPG, TIFF, or DICOM format for storage; (3) The results of AI model calculations need to be saved and be able to be associated with the subject, examination information, and fundus color photographs; (4) The data in the locally deployed and the cloud-deployed AI-assisted screening systems both need to be backed up. When the storage capacity reaches a certain threshold, the system administrator needs to update the storage; (5) The docking of an AI-assisted screening system and the PACS and HIS in the hospital need to meet the medical-related protocol specifications. 5.8 Data safety With reference to \u201cData Security Law of the People's Republic of China\u201d, \u201cPersonal Information Protection Law\u201d, \u201cNetwork Security Law\u201d, and \u201cMeasures for the Management of Population Health Information\u201d, the following things should be done. (1) Data desensitization: Subjects' sensitive information that does not affect disease diagnosis, such as name, phone number, ID number, home address, etc., should be desensitized. It should be noted that the original data characteristics should be maintained after desensitization. That is, development, testing, etc., should be not be affected by desensitization. (2) User management: This includes user identity management, authentication management, and authorization management. User management systems should give each user a unique account and identify the user to ensure that the account can be traced back. Data access should have a unified identity authentication mechanism, and for sensitive data, multistep authentication technology should be used to prevent misuse. Access authorization for various types of data needs to be realized based on the identity of the user and the confidentiality level of the accessed data. (3) Data usage log management: The system should capture a complete and unalterable record of activity, ensuring that every disruptive operation is recorded and audited, ensuring that operations are traceable, and thus aiding in the rapid location of malicious operations and attacks on the system. (4) Transmission encryption: It is required to meet the needs of the platform as well as the transmission of sensitive data through secure transmission methods and standard encryption protocols to avoid illegal access, eavesdropping, or bypass sniffing of data. Setting up sensitive data transmission monitoring, data transmission correlation analysis, and other mechanisms to ensure that the transmission is carried out safely. (5) Storage security: The data storage process needs to be protected with encryption measures to reduce the risk of data leakage. Encryption algorithms should use commercial cryptographic algorithms with security strength that meet national security requirements. In addition to data access control, the storage stage also needs to consider backup and disaster recovery, which can be achieved through local storage, network storage, and other ways to synchronize and backup data in multiple copies and data centers to achieve off-site disaster recovery. (6) Clarify the responsible person: The institution where the AI screening system is applied should clarify the responsible person for data security and develop a management system and emergency mechanism for data security. 6 Limitations and future development of the AI screening system Currently, the stability of AI screening systems dealing with the images captured by different types of cameras and with different qualities needs to be improved. Therefore, the existing AI-assisted screening systems need to be strictly constrained to shooting devices and shooting environments. It is worthwhile to look forward to the appearance of the domain adaptation learning 6 6 Domain adaptation learning: An artificial intelligence technology, a kind of transfer learning. It can effectively solve the problem of the inconsistent probability distribution of training samples and test samples. It is a hot topic in machine learning and has been widely used in natural language processing, text analysis, image analysis, bioinformatics, cross-language analysis, video analysis, emotion analysis, and handwriting recognition. in AI technology [54\u201355], which can alleviate the problem of poor robustness of AI models for screening the images of different quality or acquired by different camera types. In addition, the AI system based on deep learning techniques is often a \u201cblack box\u201d, and it is difficult to interpret for disease discrimination. This guideline takes the lesion sign as the detection unit, and in Section 3, the detection, localization, segmentation, and other tasks of lesion signs are proposed. Among them, the localization of lesion signs can be used as an indication of the area of concern when the subject is reviewed, prompting the physician to pay attention to the increase or decrease of lesion signs in the area over a period of time. Therefore, it is recommended to cover several subtasks in the disease diagnosis process when applying AI systems in medical scenarios. This guideline focuses on the screening scene of lesion signs with single-modality data of fundus color images. Due to the complexity of macular diseases, single-modality data cannot provide comprehensive information for the ocular structures and lesions. Therefore, an AI-assisted screening system for macular diseases considering multiple fundus image modalities can be developed in the future. Notably, such assisted screening systems urgently require the development of fundus imaging hardware, such as the emergence of easily photographed, low-priced OCT acquisition devices. At present, it has been agreed that the application of the AI system in the medical needs to be reviewed by professional doctors. Therefore, AI can be regarded as a tool to assist doctors, and AI screening is not the same as a diagnosis by professional doctors. AI screening systems have good applications in the early screening of certain diseases/signs, which can alleviate the problem of a large screening population and an insufficient number of professional doctors. It is believed that in the future, more diseases/signs screening systems will appear with the help of AI technology (Figure 7). 7 Abbreviation ACC accuracy AI artificial intelligence AMD age-related macular degeneration AP average precision AUC area under curve CME cystoid macular edema CSME clinically significant macular edema DICE dice coefficient ETDRS early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study FN false negative FP false positive GA geographic atrophy HIS hospital information system ID identity document IoU intersection over union mAP mean average precision MED mean euclidean distance MNV macular neovascularization MR miss rate NPV negative prediction value PACS picture archiving communication system Pre precision ROC receiver operating characteristic RRD rhegmatogenous retinal detachment Sen sensitivity Spe specificity TN true negative TP true positive Expert Group on Guidance Development Medicine group: Ocular Fundus Diseases Group of Chinese Ophthalmological Society Ming Zhang, Department of Ophthalmology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Director, Writing) Xun Xu, Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Group leader) Yusheng Wang, Department of Ophthalmology, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University (Vice group leader) Wenbin Wei, Beijing Tongren Eye Centre, Beijing Key Laboratory of Intraocular Tumour Diagnosis and Treatment, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University (Vice group leader) Mingwei Zhao, Department of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmology and Optometry Centre, Peking University People's Hospital (Vice group leader) Youxin Chen, Department of Ophthalmology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital Xiaorong Li, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Retinal Functions and Diseases, Tianjin International Joint Research and Development Centre of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Eye Institute and School of Optometry, Tianjin Medical University Eye Hospital Fang Lu, Department of Ophthalmology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University Qinghuai Liu, Department of Ophthalmology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University Bo Lei, Department of Ophthalmology, Henan Eye Institute, Henan Eye Hospital, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University Jinfeng Qu, Department of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmology and Optometry Centre, Peking University People's Hospital Feng Wen, Department of Ophthalmology, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre, Sun Yat-sen University Suqin Yu, Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Weihua Yang, The Affiliated Eye Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Red Cross Eve Hospital Shaochong Zhang, Shenzhen Eye Hospital Liang Du, Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Evidence-Based Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University Dongyue Wang, Department of Ophthalmology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Secretary) AI group: Yanwu Xu, Beijing Baidu Netcom Science Technology Co.

In DEPSI environments, combining human feedback with interactive learning processes makes possible the idea of AGI generating infinite tasks that align with human values. Fig. 2 An illustration of the Tong test pipeline, including the testing interface, DEPSI environments, and AGI evaluation. The testing interface positions the AGI models within a virtual simulation environment and supports human-involved embodied interactions with AIs through virtual reality (VR). The DEPSI environments cover a wide range of daily-life household scenarios and tasks with insights from classical psychological theories. More specifically, tasks can be represented by spatial\u2013temporal\u2013causal parse graphs of the dynamic environment. Tasks can be decomposed into subtasks by sampling from the parse graph, as shown by the red pathway. Infinite tasks can be created with combinations of different objects, physical and social fluent states, and actions. Finally, in the AGI evaluation module, the AGI scores can be quantified into multidimensional abilities (i.e., vision, language, cognition, motor, and learning) and values through task decomposition. The final model performance can be quantified through a function F of performance scores across tasks and represented with a radar plot.

The architecture consists of three main parts: infrastructure, DEPSI environments, and evaluation tools.

The release of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series has brought artificial general intelligence (AGI) to the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) field once again. However, the questions of how to define and evaluate AGI remain unclear. This perspective article proposes that the evaluation of AGI should be rooted in dynamic embodied physical and social interactions (DEPSI). More specifically, we propose five critical characteristics to be considered as AGI benchmarks and suggest the Tong test as an AGI evaluation system. The Tong test describes a value- and ability-oriented testing system that delineates five levels of AGI milestones through a virtual environment with DEPSI, allowing for infinite task generation. We contrast the Tong test with classical AI testing systems in terms of various aspects and propose a systematic evaluation system to promote standardized, quantitative, and objective benchmarks and evaluation of AGI. Keywords Artificial general intelligence Artificial intelligence benchmark Artificial intelligence evaluation Embodied artificial intelligence Value alignment Turing test Causality 1 Artificial general intelligence (AGI) evaluation in embodied dynamic environments With the recent release of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series, AGI is once again the center of attention in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent foundation models exhibit the ability to generalize within specific domains, such as GPT-4 [1] in natural language processing (NLP), Segment Anything Model (SAM) [2] in image segmentation, and PaLM-E [3] in NLP and robotics. However, there is contention regarding whether human-like characteristics such as the Theory of Mind (ToM) or cognitive abilities have emerged in foundation models [4\u20138]. In the era of AGI, new benchmarks are urgently needed to clarify what defines AGI and how AGI may be evaluated. Can AGI be evaluated through the classic Turing test? The answer is likely \u201cno.\u201d The nature of AGI differs from AI in terms of generality. Whereas the generality of AI lies mainly in data generalization (i.e., going beyond training data and performing well on unseen testing data), the generality of AGI emphasizes task generalization. Here, task generalization means that AGI must be able to adapt and behave well in a dynamic environment in which it may encounter an infinite number of unexpected scenarios, similar to how humans adapt to and behave within their living environments. It is widely recognized that the human capacities for understanding and reasoning are grounded in the biological processes of organism\u2013environment interactions [9,10]. In the field of psychology, evaluations of human subjects\u2014particularly infants\u2014generally closely integrate face-to-face interviews with tests [11\u201314], allowing for a more comprehensive assessment that encompasses not only knowledge and problem-solving abilities but also other important aspects of human cognition and behavior. In the context of AGI, such testing scenarios for intelligent agents can be summarized as environments involving dynamic embodied physical and social interactions (DEPSI) with other agents. Here, we propose that AGI evaluation should be rooted in scenarios with the complex environments of DEPSI. For example, consider an AGI whose role is to serve humans in a household: The AGI may encounter a crying baby sitting on the floor or a hundred-dollar bill fallen on the ground near a spilled cup of coffee. It is only through evaluations within DEPSI that the human-like abilities of AGI, such as commonsense reasoning, intention inference of social interactions, self-awareness, and trust, can be sufficiently assessed. Furthermore, only AGIs that pass tests within DEPSI can be expected to be able to truly integrate into human daily life. 1.1 The AGI task space within DEPSI: A novel definition As AGI agents are introduced into the embodied real world, it is natural to expect that AGI benchmarks will be established in DEPSI, where AGIs will be examined on their performance and learning of various aspects of the world within the constraints of physical rules and social norms, as shown in Fig. 1 . However, current benchmarks for AI models are primarily limited to specific tasks in subspaces and lack immersive interaction with the environment. A recent review has shown that current embodied AI tasks mainly include visual exploration, visual navigation, and embodied question-answering [15]. But obviously, the tasks that humans must contend with in daily life far exceed these categories. In essence, complex events in our world can be described in a unified space that encompasses both physical and social dimensions [16], and the internal structure of this task space determines the fundamental abilities and values of the AGI agents inhabiting it. Here, we propose a novel definition of a task T based on DEPSI for AGI evaluation: T = (\u03d5 initial , \u03d5 target), where \u03d5 initial represents the equivalence set of the initial states of DEPSI, and \u03d5 target represents the equivalence set of the target states of DEPSI. Considering the complexity and diversity of the DEPSI environment, it is difficult to obtain the same DEPSI state every time the task starts or ends. Therefore, we define the start or target of a task as an equivalent set of all eligible states, \u03d5 = {s | fi (s) = ti, i = 1, 2, \u2026, k}, where functions fi (\u00b7) represent the features of the DEPSI environment state s, such as distances between objects in the physical state space or the most probable position in the social state space, k is the number of features, and ti is the corresponding function value. Next, we further delineate the internal structure of the task space of DEPSI. The task space can be decomposed into physical and social state spaces. The physical state space includes physical quantities that describe the world (e.g., position x of an object), while the social state space comprises agents\u2019 estimations of the physical state (e.g., an agent\u2019s belief about the object\u2019s position) represented by probability, based on observations, interactions with the world, and feedback from other agents or environments. Therefore, both physical and social tasks can be formally defined within DEPSI. Physical tasks involve actions related to the physical environment, such as retrieving an object or preparing food, which require common knowledge of the world. Social tasks involve social interactions such as cooperation with other agents, which require an understanding of others\u2019 social states and values while imposing constraints on social states. The complexity of tasks can be determined by the scale of physical and social states the task requires the AGI to manipulate. For example, relatively simple first-order tasks may be atomic actions such as pressing a button, which can hardly be further decomposed, whereas more difficult composite tasks may be multi-atomic, such as requiring AGI agents to create tools that can complete another task. 1.2 Basic features of AGI in DEPSI To survive and adapt to an environment of DEPSI, we propose that the evaluation of a typical AGI system should target the following features. 1.2.1 Infinite tasks At present, a shift is occurring in AI development from single-task specified models to multi-task foundation models. However, as AIs are empowered to perform more tasks, the question arises: How many tasks are required for a system to be considered \u201cgeneral\u201d? If 100 tasks are insufficient, what about 101 tasks? If N tasks do not constitute \u201cgeneral\u201d intelligence, then neither do N + 1 tasks. Human intelligence is not limited to a specific number of tasks. Rather, humans can perform an infinite number of tasks that are not predefined, which also applies to AGI as a fundamental feature (Fig. 1). 1.2.2 Self-driven task generation To deal with unexpected situations in real life (e.g., a household with young children, a senior care clinic, or the ruins of a city after an earthquake), an AGI must go beyond human-defined tasks and be self-driven (i.e., initiating actions driven by its own \u201cpurpose\u201d). More specifically, when placed in an open environment, an AGI should have the ability to know what to do next and to autonomously generate tasks that drive its actions without fine-grained instructions or prompts from a human operator. For example, assuming that an AGI serves humans in a household, will the AGI be indifferent to a baby who is crying, simply because it was never trained to deal with such a situation? When faced with a hundred-dollar bill that falls to the ground, will it treat the bill as garbage and recycling? Does the AGI loyally obey a small child who requests sharp scissors to play with? Although one can provide extensive training data and define comprehensive rules that attempt to exhaust all possible scenarios, these are confined as finite sets and are prone to corner cases. Self-driven agents, however, can accumulate experience and increase their coverage of corner cases by learning from the accumulated experience of exploration and human feedback. Existing research has shown promising results indicating that self-driven AI systems powered by curiosity can discover skills that can be composed to solve complex and challenging tasks [17,18]. 1.2.3 Value alignment We propose that values are the fundamental driving forces behind self-driven behaviors. To enable AGI to autonomously generate and complete various tasks that satisfy human needs, one feasible approach is to endow AGI with a value system. Here, the proposed value system differs from the concept of value in reinforcement learning (RL) from a few perspectives. In RL, the value is the expected reward of a state when a policy \u03c0 is adopted, being used to guide the agent to make better sequences of actions in order to achieve the goal. In comparison, the values in AGI systems cover a greater space that does not rely on tasks; this is defined as the \u201cfluent space\u201d (Section 3.1), which can cover as small a space as a game or as large a space as a society or an agent\u2019s life. Furthermore, values in AGI drive behaviors and actions that are not necessarily dependent upon goals. For example, an agent can prefer the color blue to red, tidiness to messy arrangements, and cooperation to competition. These value representations do not necessarily change depending on tasks or goals. Such value systems can be explicit, implicit, or mixed. Instead of explicitly defining a value system, AGIs can also acquire implicit value representations through preference learning, contrastive learning, safe RL [19], and so forth. Both the values in RL and those in AGI agents serve as the fundamental factors that drive actions, with the aim of maximizing the values. However, they are different concepts, serving different purposes in different problem spaces. The endowed value system of AGI involves the same fundamental value dimensions as the human value system, making it possible for AGI to learn human preferences in the value system through limited interactions with humans, thereby achieving value alignment. Such value alignment can be achieved through different approaches, including defining value functions based on prior knowledge (e.g., assigning a high value to human safety in AGI), and fine-tuning functions based on human-in-the-loop feedback through interactive explorations (e.g., see Ref. [20]). Human values have been widely studied in psychology, such as Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs [21], the existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) theory [22], and the Schwartz Value Survey [23]. Based on the principle of AGI aligning with human values and these classical value theories, the AGI value system includes five levels, from the most basic level of satisfying survival needs to the highest level of group value (Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, to ensure the safety of the value-driven AGI to humans, it is essential to design systems that are independent of the value-driven AGI in order to regulate and constrain the tasks generated by and behaviors executed by it. In this way, the AGI\u2019s actions align with the values of human society, rather than the values of specific individuals or organizations. AGIs can gain the trust of humans by aligning with human values. This trust comes from two perspectives: trust in AI abilities\u2014that is, when humans trust AGIs to correctly perform tasks and achieve task generalization; and, more importantly, trust in AGIs\u2019 values\u2014that is, when humans trust AGIs to behave according to human society\u2019s rules and morals. 1.2.4 Causal understanding Causal reasoning emerges early in human developmental trajectories [24\u201330]. AI researchers have also proposed causal understanding as one of the foundational pillars that support cognitive AI with human-level common sense [31,32], which makes explainable AI (XAI) and ethically responsible AI possible [33]. Causality is the crucial chain that connects values and behaviors. In the context of AGI, causality is based on natural and social laws in DEPSI that determine the path of task completion. For example, in the case of a monkey picking bananas, the task is first generated autonomously, driven by the intrinsic value function of \u201chunger,\u201d which results in the task goal of \u201cneeding to pick bananas to eat.\u201d The task is constrained by the causality of physiological and physical laws (e.g., friction and gravity); for example, a monkey cannot directly jump up 2 m to pick a banana. In the end, under the constraints imposed by the value\u2013causality\u2013behavior chain, the monkey climbing a tree to pick bananas becomes a feasible solution. Take cleaning up a messy table as another example: The internal driving force of this task is the individual\u2019s or others\u2019 aesthetic demand for tidiness; therefore, the individual needs to clean up the table, and the act of \u201ccleaning up\u201d is bound by physical laws, such as how to place items in a stable way. Finally, under the impetus of the value\u2013causality\u2013behavior chain, the individual produces a series of behaviors and decisions to complete the task. Despite the importance of causal understanding for both humans and AIs, existing AI evaluations rarely examine machines\u2019 causal understanding in the DEPSI world. Most tests take the form of question-answering and evaluate the textual causal reasoning abilities [34], without ensuring understanding in an embodied environment. Attempts to test AI\u2019s understanding of physical and social laws in the real world have been limited to specific scenarios, such as simple classical mechanics puzzles in a two-dimensional (2D) physical environment [35], causal inference of traffic events [34], robotic manipulation tasks of constructing three-dimensional (3D) shapes from a given set of blocks in a 3D world [36], and so forth. In fact, existing evidence suggests that AI encounters major challenges in describing the world in a causal manner. For example, Lake et al. [32] documented instances in which the neural networks reported in Ref. [37] failed to generate accurate image captions with the correct causal relationship. 1.2.5 Embodiment The fundamental purpose of developing AGI is to serve human society and move human civilization forward. Therefore, AGI must be able to participate in human life and industrial production in a way that directly benefits humans. Regardless of what embodied form AGI exists in (e.g., whether in a human form or as an object, or whether in a physical embodiment or virtual environment), the aim should be to build a feasible human\u2013machine interaction paradigm and be able to establish smooth communication between AGI and humans. Hence, developing embodied AI may serve as a fundamental approach to reaching the goals of AGI. In addition, embodied AI can be integrated into virtual and physical environments and serve humans without any barriers across different embodied forms. For example, an AGI might appear as a teacher in a virtual environment and demonstrate using a physical embodiment such as robot arms, thus making presentations to human learners to improve teaching effectiveness. This example foreshadows the possibility that embodied AI could be a promising technology path for AGI. 1.3 Large language models and AGI Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on various language tasks, a few systematic evaluations have pointed out the limitations of LLMs. For example, LLMs have been found to suffer from forgetting issues, fail on commonsense reasoning tasks, perform worse in contexts of under-represented languages [38], and occasionally fail to systematically demonstrate problem-solving skills [39]. In studies comparing LLMs and children using developmental psychology experiments, researchers found that LLMs had limitations in the domains of object and action understanding, ToM, and\u2014especially\u2014causal reasoning tasks, which may require embodied and self-initiated explorations and cannot be fully acquired from language inputs [40]. Based on the aforementioned AGI criteria, it is worth noting that current LLMs, such as the GPT series, may not be appropriately labeled as AGI. Instead, current LLMs are essentially statistical models that rely on large amounts of data to acquire complex statistical regularities, achieving close-to-human-level performance on text-based tasks and being able to generalize across tasks within the language domain. Importantly, current LLMs still lack the ability to generate tasks in a self-driven manner, driven by a value system that aligns with that of human society. Moreover, current LLMs are confined to the language domain, and are far from being able to cope with the dynamic and unexpected scenarios in embodied human life Furthermore, without an embodied environment, it is difficult to disentangle thoughts from language in LLMs. Language and thoughts are correlated yet different concepts, where thoughts refer to ideas that are represented mentally, and language provides a tool to express thoughts. In LLMs, fluent language production captures only one aspect of thoughts, while many other aspects of thoughts\u2014such as emotions, memories, and perceptions\u2014may not be fully captured by the language domain. Based on the criteria of AGI, we propose the Tong test (where \u201cTong\u201d corresponds to the pronunciation of the Chinese character of \u201cgeneral,\u201d as in \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d) as a systematic AGI evaluation system that is based on an environment with DEPSI, shifting from task-oriented to ability-and value-oriented evaluations of AGI. The proposed virtual platform could also support embodied AI in training and testing, with embodied AI agents acquiring information within this platform and continuing to learn and fine-tune their values and abilities in an interactive manner. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of classic AI benchmarks in the past, including human discrimination and task-oriented problem benchmarks. This section also discusses developmental psychology and intelligence theories, which provide insights for the proposed Tong test. In Section 3, we introduce the Tong test\u2019s technical architecture and design features, which constitute a systemic evaluation system targeting the basic features of AGI. 2 From the Turing test to the Tong test 2.1 Classic AI evaluations Benchmarks are urgently needed to guide the future development of AGI. However, as mentioned earlier, classic AI and intelligence evaluation approaches in the past have shown major limitations when applied in the domain of AGI. Here, we briefly review past AI evaluations from the perspectives of human discrimination tests and task-oriented problem benchmarks (including dataset-based and environment-based evaluations). See Table 1 for comparisons between different AI evaluations. As the first major category of past AI evaluation, human discrimination tests evaluate AI based on human observations, as represented by the classic Turing test. The Turing test, initially named the Imitation Game, grew out of a thought experiment devised by Alan Turing. This test pits human respondents against a machine to test the machine\u2019s ability to exhibit human-like responses and intelligence. To pass the Turing test, an AI algorithm is required to interact with a person based on language or text in such a way that the person cannot distinguish whether it is a person or a machine. Such human discrimination tests provide a simple and operational definition of AI but also have major limitations. For example, the Turing test can only be tested qualitatively (i.e., pass or fail) and cannot be used to quantitatively measure ability. Such tests also rely heavily on the knowledge and cognitive level of the human judge, making it difficult to achieve objective and standardized testing. Interestingly, there have been several instances of chatbots passing the Turing test based on the implementation of specially designed response strategy algorithms, which are far from being truly intelligent. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the major limitation of the Turing test lies in its lack of embodiment when being considered in the context of evaluating AGI, given the language-specific nature of the Turing test. The second major category can be summarized as task-oriented problem benchmarks. Numerous datasets have been proposed over the past 10\u201320 years (e.g., Refs. [41\u201345]), which have been used as benchmarks in thousands of papers on specific areas of AI. More specifically, with the expansion of annotation, there has been a transition from single task-oriented benchmarks (e.g., the ImageNet dataset that is solely for the task of image classification) to multitask-oriented benchmarks (e.g., General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) for single-sentence tasks, similarity and paraphrasing tasks, and natural language inference tasks). Nevertheless, in essence, these task-oriented benchmarks emphasize the solving of highly specific problems, instead of pushing AI toward AGI (for a review, see Ref. [46]). Aside from dataset-based benchmarks, several environment-based benchmarks have been developed, such as OpenAI Gym [47], DeepMind Lab [48], iGibson [49], ThreeDWorld [50], Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)-The House Of inteRactions (THOR) [51], AI Habitat [52], House3D [53], and VirtualHome [54]. Moreover, an increasing number of researchers are emphasizing embodiment in evaluations of AIs [55]. These systems share common goals, which include: providing realistic and diverse scenarios, supporting rich and flexible interactions, and facilitating data collection and analysis. However, such evaluation systems are predefined by humans and cannot generate infinite tasks. Recently, efforts have been made by the AI community to develop AGI benchmarks. For example, the French National Laboratory of Metrology and Testing has proposed a high-level taxonomy of AI capabilities and has grouped evaluation tasks into the capabilities of the traditional \u201crecognition, understanding, mission management, and generation\u201d pipeline [56]. The AI2 has collected dozens of standard AI measurements, such as the AI2-THOR Rearrangement Challenge [51] and AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) [57], on the AI2 Leaderboard in a simply listed, unsystematic way. Google introduced the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench), a creative collaborative effort with over 200 tasks from various fields for language models [58], while Stanford\u2019s Behavior dataset serves as a comprehensive simulation benchmark for human-centered robotics [59]; both benchmarks evaluate specific abilities of AGI. More recently, Xu and Ren [60] proposed an evaluation method named Artificial Open World, in which developers are unable to perceive the world and solve problems by themselves before testing, with the aim of avoiding the influence of developers\u2019 prior experience. Furthermore, OpenAI tested GPT-4 on various professional and academic exams [1], such as the Uniform Bar Examination, Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), Graduate Record Examination (GRE), and Law School Admission Test (LSAT), which are originally designed for humans. However, these benchmarks are limited to finite tasks within a specific subspace of general AI. 2.2 Insights from developmental psychology and intelligence theories Given the challenges above, we review psychological developmental and intelligence theories and tests as inspiration for future AGI evaluations. Several classic psychological intelligence tests mark advances in our understanding of human intelligence, such as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales [61], Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development [62], Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [63], and Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices [64]. These tests share several features in common: defined developmental milestones (i.e., achieving which abilities at what stages); and integrated tasks that comprise multiple dimensions of abilities (e.g., vision, natural language, cognition and reasoning, motor skills, and learning). Reflecting upon the intelligence tests, the Tong test shares common ground with classic intelligence theories. For example, the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence [65] proposes three major components of intelligence: practical (the ability to adapt to different contexts); creative (the ability to come up with new ideas); and analytical (the ability to evaluate information and solve problems). These components can be mapped to the concepts of embodiment, self-drive, and causal understanding in the Tong test. 3 The Tong test: AGI evaluation in a virtual environment with DEPSI To promote the transition from specific AI to general AI rooted in DEPSI, we propose the Tong test, a benchmark and evaluation system focusing on essential features such as infinite tasks, self-driven task generation, value alignment, causal understanding, and embodiment. Therefore, we define the Tong test as an AGI evaluation system that emulates the complexity of the real physical social world in a virtual environment, enables the generation of infinite tasks, and quantifies levels of multidimensional abilities and values of AGI through interactions between embodied AGI and human agents. 3.1 An infinite task-generation system To build a Tong test platform that supports infinite tasks, we adopt a compositional graphical model (i.e., a \u201cparse graph\u201d [66]) as a basic form of knowledge representation that parses the spatial, temporal, and causal relations of any given scene (Fig. 2). Building upon this, we define \u201cfluent space\u201d as a space for the time-varying variables of attributes in a given parse graph, where \u201cfluent\u201d represents a time-varying quantity or variable [67]. With the proposed knowledge representation form (i.e., a parse graph with fluent space), all possible scene configurations can be represented within a continuous space of DEPSI environments. Therefore, we define a task as a transition between two sample points within the fluent space of DEPSI environments, where the starting sample point corresponds to an initial scene configuration and the ending sample point corresponds to the desired status (e.g., from state 1, where a cup is empty, to state 2, where the cup is filled with water). Furthermore, tasks can be decomposed into subtasks by sampling from the parse graph, creating a hierarchical task space. The Tong test platform is capable of generating a series of 3D virtual scenes with physically realistic and interaction-rich features, which satisfies the required scene configurations. In this way, an infinite task-generation process can be achieved by sampling configurations (e.g., combinations of different objects, physical and social fluent states, and actions) in the continuous space of DEPSI environments and building corresponding 3D virtual scenes via the Tong test platform. 3.2 Value- and ability-oriented evaluations: Testing the understanding of AGI models Based on the value\u2013causality\u2013behavior chain, the Tong test spans two domains\u2014that is, ability and value, or the U\u2013V dual system. The U-system describes the agent\u2019s understanding of extrinsic physical or social rules, while the V-system comprises the agent\u2019s intrinsic values, which are defined as a set of value functions upon which the self-driven behaviors of the agent are built. Following the U\u2013V dual system, ability and value are the two basic core aspects of tasks, and all the tasks can be decomposed into and described by a set of abilities and values. Inspired by the core systems in human developmental trajectories [68] and the major subdisciplines in AI research, the ability system is divided into five dimensions (i.e., vision, natural language, cognition and reasoning, motor skills, and learning). Furthermore, each ability dimension is designed with five levels that increase with the complexity of the tasks. The benchmarks are proposed based on a combination of infant development milestones (e.g., Refs. [61\u201363]), AI expert judgments, and a review of AI development patterns. The higher levels define an ability space that covers a wider scope of world representations, similar to human child development over the years. Once the testing tasks for all ability levels are determined, the ability level can be identified by examining whether tasks representing certain levels can be accomplished. On our Tong test platform, classical psychological tests such as self-awareness [69,70] and ToM [71,72], as well as all kinds of social value tasks [73\u201375] and so forth are made possible. More specifically, the debated question of whether AGIs possess consciousness and mind may be evaluated through a series of interactive tasks covering self-knowledge, self-control, the experience of existence, and curiosity [76]. For example, the mirror test is a classic paradigm to determine the self-awareness of an agent (e.g., a human child). In the test, an experimenter surreptitiously places a dot on the face of the child. The child is then positioned in front of a mirror. If the child touches the mark on her or his forehead, it is an indicator of self-recognition [13]. One major contrast between the Tong test and previous benchmarks lies in its evaluation of values. Values have been modeled in previous works (for a review, see Ref. [77]). However, past evaluations of AIs have been solely focused on abilities. For AGIs, the value system is the source of the driving force for task generation, leading to infinite tasks. Based on the principle of AGI aligning with human values and classic value theories in psychology (e.g., Maslow\u2019s hierarchy [21], the ERG theory [22], and Schwartz\u2019s Rokeach Value Survey [23]), the Tong test proposes a value system with five levels (Table 2 ), from physiological and survival needs, to emotional and social values, and finally to group values. By designing testing scenarios that do not specify clear task goals, the values of AGIs can be observed from their autonomous behaviors. The testing of an agent\u2019s values should be based on the extent to which it completes testing tasks of value dimension. More specifically, values can be measured through an open-ended testing scenario in which an AGI is assessed on whether it can actively generate tasks according to the environment setup. For example, in a room where a cup is dangerously placed on the edge of a table, whether the AGI agent actively moves the cup to a safer location in a self-driven manner would reflect the AGI\u2019s values of safety. Importantly, although the U\u2013V spaces are divided into different dimensions and levels, quantifying the levels of AGI not only assesses the level within a single dimension but also emphasizes the cross-dimension measurement and a high degree of integration of all dimensions. We propose one possible approach to achieve cross-domain evaluations. First, abilities can be examined within every single dimension, where the AGI agent yields a set of scores representing the estimated ability and value levels across individual dimensions. For example, the task of cleaning tables can be decomposed into different levels of ability and value dimensions (e.g., vision level 2, motor skill level 3, cognition and reasoning level 3, and value level 2). The highest level of tasks that can be completed by the AGI agent will be labeled as the AGI\u2019s level for the corresponding ability or value dimension. Then, a six-dimension vector can serve as the testing result of the agent (Fig. 2). It should be noted that it is not feasible to go through infinite tasks (i.e., infinite combinations of abilities and values) for each AGI agent. Instead, we could test a finite number of tasks representing combinations of multiple dimensions of abilities and values as a more practical way of evaluating AGI. 3.3 The pipeline and architecture of the Tong test platform The Tong test is implemented as a virtual simulation platform that enables AGI agents to perceive, learn, interact, and evaluate within 3D environments. In practice, the Tong test can be constructed based on DEPSI environments. This platform will provide the necessary infrastructure for examinations across ability and value dimensions. The system generates infinite tasks with dynamic embodied interaction scenarios across all dimensions of abilities and values. Notably, we propose that AGI evaluations can be constructed in either real or virtual environments. Considering the goal of infinite tasks while controlling costs, we tentatively construct the idea based on a virtual platform as a prototype. The test pipeline is shown in Fig. 2. The Tong test platform is proposed for testing embodied AI, considering both the ability and value dimensions, and aligning with the idea of an embodied Turing test [55]. However, unlike previous testing platforms, human\u2013AI interaction must be considered in order to simultaneously test the capability and value dimensions of the AI agents. Therefore, the Tong test platform combines a general algorithmic testing paradigm with a human\u2013AI interaction-based testing paradigm, which follows the philosophy of the Turing test. As mentioned earlier, the Tong test focuses on testing the ability and value dimensions. In terms of implementation, for the ability dimension, the Tong test platform is leveraged to generate tasks over a large scale in order to measure the performance of an AGI agent. For the value dimension, the AGI agent is placed in different task scenarios to test whether it can actively generate various tasks based on observations and whether its execution of the self-generated tasks exhibits the value factors. These task scenarios for testing can also be training task scenarios to provide training support for AGI agents. It should be noted that the test scenarios must be regenerated each time in order to avoid overfitting situations due to repeated testing. Moreover, a feasible way to increase the randomness and effectiveness of the testing scenes is to introduce human interaction into some testing scenes. We have built several basic systems that may serve as supporting modules in building the Tong test platform. For example, we have proposed the VRGym [78] and VRKitchen [79] test beds for physical and interactive AI, to foster AI training tasks that involve human\u2013AI interactions. These test beds shed light on human-in-the-loop AI training and testing in physical-realistic and interaction-rich virtual environments. Recently, we released a novel dataset, Situated Question Answering in 3D Scenes (SQA3D), for evaluating embodied scene understanding, where an agent must comprehend the scene it is situated within from a first-person perspective and answer questions [80]. Based on previous technological accumulation and the aforementioned test pipeline, we develop the Tong test platform by building upon three essential components: infrastructure, DEPSI environments, and evaluation tools, as shown in Fig. 3 . First, to establish the infrastructure of the Tong test platform, a significant amount of hardware\u2014including servers, databases, and communication networks\u2014is required to support thousands of application instances working in parallel. In addition, a wide range of software and interaction device ecosystems is necessary. Various graphical engines, such as Unity 3D, Unreal Engine 4/5, and the Omniverse platform, have been utilized to develop metaverse applications, and these software tools can be used to create content for the Tong test platform. To facilitate the integration of human users into the DEPSI environments and enhance the complexity of the test scenarios, we utilize virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality devices as human interfaces. Digital assets are a crucial component of the infrastructure and play a foundational role in building task environments for the Tong test platform. We sample various reasonable layouts of indoor rooms and place interactive objects related to tasks, thereby making infinite test scenarios possible. Second, the DEPSI environments serve as the test environments, which are constructed on top of the essential functional modules and task-generation modules. The functional modules include the data sensor module, physics simulation, fine-grained manipulation, and other general modules that ensure that the system works normally. The task-generation modules consist of two core submodules (i.e., physical and social task generation), which help generate physically and socially realistic task scenarios. The DEPSI environments prioritize dynamic embodied interactions across physical and social spaces, requiring the integration of human users to build highly complex interactive environments. This integration can be achieved through the development of VR or monitor-based user interfaces. With the above settings, the DEPSI environments can receive various models and carry out a series of tests. If a tested algorithmic model lacks any ability dimension compared with a complete AGI model that is suitable for the Tong test, the platform provides an adapter to transform the model into a standard AGI model. This standard model uses built-in algorithmic model libraries to make up for any missing abilities. Third, the Tong test platform includes two key evaluation modules. The first module is responsible for intermediate data visualization, which assists in the model-debugging process when the model output is not as expected. The second module is a panel that displays the model\u2019s performance, indicating how well the tested model performs according to the value- and ability-oriented evaluation paradigm. Overall, the above design of the Tong test architecture may be a good starting point for building AGI testing systems and will foster AGI development and standardization in the long term. 4 Conclusions In sum, this perspective article discussed AGI as a promising future direction of AI and proposed benchmarks and the evaluation of AGI based on DEPSI environments. We defined the critical features of AGI systems\u2014namely, infinite tasks, self-driven task generation, value alignment, causal understanding, and embodiment\u2014and suggested that the value\u2013causality\u2013behavior chain may be the root of intelligence phenomena. We further proposed the Tong test as a value- and ability-oriented evaluation system in a dynamic embodied environment. Classic task-oriented evaluation approaches cannot be applied to AGI evaluation, because the testing of AI cannot be based on a series of human-defined tasks. Thus, we proposed the Tong test based on DEPSI, as it defines not only the five multidimensional levels of values and abilities but also provides a practical pathway for building an embodied platform with infinite tasks, where AI algorithms can be evaluated onsite with human interactions. As a whole, this perspective proposes a standardized, quantitative, and objective evaluation system for AGI, with the aim of providing theoretical guidance for the development of AI algorithms.

Relationship between perceived threat of artificial intelligence and turnover intention in luxury hotels Yanan LI College of Innovation and Management, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Bangkok 10300, Thailand College of Innovation and Management Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University Bangkok 10300 Thailand College of Innovation and Management, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Bangkok 10300, Thailand When artificial intelligence technology erodes employees' professional knowledge, they tend to feel highly anxious, and turnover intention is created. This study aimed to test the impact of the perceived threat of artificial intelligence on turnover intention through perceived organizational support and the perceived value of artificial intelligence. The method and procedure were as follow: construct a theoretical framework and propose hypotheses - collect questionnaires through voluntary sampling - use a two-step approach to test the model. This study has some findings. Theoretically, this study proposes a conceptual model of artificial intelligence perception. The combination of technology threat avoidance, organizational support, and perceived value theories applies to the research background of this study. Methodologically, the relationship between the perceived threat of artificial intelligence, perceived organizational support, perceived value of artificial intelligence, and turnover intention variables was studied together for the first time, and the perceived value of artificial intelligence as a new significant mediator between perceived organizational support and turnover intention is discovered. Managementarily, when facing the threats of artificial intelligence to employees, hotel managers should emphasize organizational support, especially in finance, career, and adjustment. This study has important implications for luxury hotel management. First, hotel employees' perceptions of artificial intelligence are dual. Second, luxury hotel managers should consider perceived organizational support to be a key variable. Keywords Perceived organizational support Turnover intention Perceived threat Perceived value Artificial intelligence 1 Introduction The hospitality industry significantly contributes to global GDP and employment [1]. However, statistics show that a voluntary turnover rate (estimated to be between 30 and 300%) is prevalent in the hotel sector worldwide and much higher than in other industries. For example, in China, the hotel sector's turnover rate is as high as 40%, whereas the average turnover rate for all industries is only 20% [1]. Thus staff turnover is a crucial issue in human resource management. In a similar study, labor turnover was a huge challenge facing the hotel industry. Holston-Okae stated that Okayh's employee turnover rate leads to a lack of success, inspiration, and attraction for outstanding employees [2]. In summary, the hotel industry has benefited from global GDP and employment. However, the high turnover rates cannot be ignored. Over the last decade, there has been an increase in studies researching the evaluation of artificial intelligence applications, the social existence of artificial intelligence technology, and the impact of artificial intelligence applications on individuals and businesses [3]. Artificial intelligence technology is widely used in various hotel departments including catering, guest rooms, and marketing. For example, virtual assistants have been installed in hotel guest rooms, such as The Wynn Las Vegas and Aloft, to respond quickly to guests' needs. Problems related to emerging artificial intelligence technologies have become increasingly prominent in the news [4]. The benefits of new technologies to society have always been a concern. Paradoxically, people also pay attention to the serious consequences of artificial intelligence technology, such as moral issues, criminal use, and unemployment. In addition, there have been concerns regarding how artificial intelligence, an emerging technology, affects human operation modes. Although the development of science and technology has shown exponential growth and benefits, it has also been associated with numerous adverse effects. This negative impact includes a highly negative work output, destroying the employment relationship, making employees feel extremely insecure at work, and impeding their future professional development [5]. Today, employees face tremendous pressure because of increasingly emerging technology, which, despite offering numerous benefits, poses an impending threat to them. Employees in today's work environment must endure the usual pressures of their daily work while dealing with the effects of technological advancement. When emerging technologies erode employees' original professional knowledge, they feel psychologically threatened, which leads to anxiety, sadness, and even depression [6]. Studies have shown that artificial intelligence awareness is significantly related to turnover intentions [5,7], and this increasing trend in technology usage has led to employment uncertainty and higher turnover intention among employees [8]. Fortunately, when employees receive organizational support, their reactions is involve psychological attachment and loyalty to the organization [5]. Studies have shown that perceived organizational support can be a potential moderating factor in the relationship between employees' perceived threat of artificial intelligence and turnover intention. This relationship weakens when employees experience higher levels of organizational support [7]. Another point that cannot be ignored is the perceived value of artificial intelligence, which is the opposite of its perceived threat. Research has shown that increasing customers' perceived value of artificial intelligence in marketing can help increase their willingness to purchase [9], and increasing employees' perceived value of artificial intelligence in human resources departments can help retain employees [10]. People prefer artificial intelligence technology to human decisions because artificial intelligence decisions seem fairer and reflect greater respect for employees [11]. Therefore, the research objective of this study is to validate the proposed theoretical model for the impact of the perceived threat of artificial intelligence on turnover intention in luxury hotels and to clarify the roles played by perceived organizational support and the perceived value of artificial intelligence. The higher a hotel's star rating, the greater it's capacity and ability to implement artificial intelligence technology. Therefore, this study focuses on five-star rated luxury hotels. The empirical study process was as follows: constructing a theoretical framework and proposing hypotheses - collecting questionnaires through voluntary sampling - using a two-step approach to test the model. Few studies have examined the theoretical framework of the impact of the perceived threat of artificial intelligence on turnover intention through the perceived organizational support and the perceived value of artificial intelligence, which may be a research gap. At the same time, it also reflects the novelty of this study from the perspective of the double-sided perception of artificial intelligence technology. Its theoretical significance lies in the development of a theoretical model of artificial intelligence perception. Its practical significance lies for luxury hotels and their employees. For luxury hotels, the most direct benefit was increased employee retention. Good career growth is the most direct benefit for hotel employees. 2 Literature review and hypotheses development 2.1 Perceived threat of artificial intelligence Perceived threat (PT) is the recognition of danger or injury from the two dimensions of susceptibility and severity [12]. Artificial intelligence (AI) can realize complex mathematical algorithms and is defined as a set of extensive computer-aided systems that can efficiently solve problems and make decisions [13]. According to the definition of PT and AI, the perceived threat of artificial intelligence (PTAI) in this study refers to an individual's perception of the threat or harm caused by the application of AI technology. Perceived susceptibility refers to a person's belief in the risk of encountering threats, whereas perceived severity refers to a person's belief in the magnitude of encountering threats [14]. The perceived sensitivity of AI corresponds to knowledge and belief about AI applications. The perceived severity of AI is an assessment of personal beliefs regarding the individual suffering of the process and the intensity of the AI application. 2.2 Perceived organizational support Perceived organizational support (POS) refers to the degree of perceived support by employees from their organization and the depth of the organization's concern for employees' well-being and contributions [15]. POS is measured by multiple dimensions, one of which is reflected in finance, career, and adjustment [16,17], namely FPOS, CPOS, and APOS. The FPOS measures how much employees perceive that their company cares about their financial needs; The CPOS is the degree to which employees care about the professional requirements of their organization; The APOS aims to help employees and their families adjust promptly to their current working and living environments [17]. 2.3 Perceived value of artificial intelligence Perceived value (PV) refers to the utility obtained by individuals from functional, product, or technical aspects of a technology or service [18] and is evaluated by utilitarian and hedonic [9]. Combining the definitions of PV and AI, the perceived value of artificial intelligence (PVAI) in this study refers to the utility that employees obtain by applying AI technology. Perceived utilitarian value is reflected in behavior or products, including saving time, costs, and convenience of use [19]. Perceived hedonic value reflects mental concentration and interest in the degree of the interactive process, expressed as arousal, curiosity, surprise [20], pleasure, and relaxation [21]. 2.4 Turnover intention Staff turnover is closely related to turnover intention. Employees\u2019 willingness to voluntarily leave a company is known as turnover intention (TI) [22]. It refers to the willingness to leave the organization for various reasons, to find a better alternative job, or to resign or stay in the current company [23]. 3 Conceptual framework and hypothesis formulation This study conceptualized the associations among PTAI, POS, PVAI, and TI. A relationship framework was developed between the PTAI and TI. 3.1 Perceived threat of artificial intelligence and turnover intention Technology threat avoidance theory refers to the individual's perception of the threat or harm caused by information technology [24]. When the continuous development of AI technology erodes employees' professional knowledge and they perceive threats, they tend to become highly anxious [6]. According to the technology threat avoidance theory, if companies continue to use AI technology in the workplace, this may result in potentially high staff turnover rates across different industries. The study revealed that heightened AI awareness is negatively related to career satisfaction and positively related to turnover intention, cynicism, and depression [5]. The hotel industry is no exception, believing that the increasing trend in technology usage has led to uncertainty in employment and higher employee turnover intention [8]. Therefore, the following hypothesis was proposed: H1 PTAI has a significant positive correlation with employees' TI in luxury hotels. 3.2 Perceived organizational support as a moderating role Based on the social exchange theory and the principle of reciprocity, the organizational support theory was proposed [25]. According to the organizational support theory, POS makes employees think that they will receive help from the organization when they encounter difficulties. The support and resources provided by the organization make employees feel more capable and motivated to work [26]. In the era of AI technology development, POS provides employees with a supportive working environment, enabling them to build greater autonomy when encountering the negative impact of AI applications, to improve employees' overall well-being and satisfaction. POS can be considered as a potential moderating factor in the relationship between employees' perceived threat of AI and their turnover intention. When employees experience higher levels of organizational support, this relationship will weaken in the hotel industry [7]. Therefore, the following hypothesis was proposed: H2 POS is a significant moderator between PTAI and TI in luxury hotels. 3.3 Perceived organizational support and turnover intention Organizational support theory is based on the social exchange theory, and any organization's support will significantly impact employees, prompting them as a loyal to participate more in work [15]. The impact of POS on employee TI has always been a common area of study. It has been proven in different research fields [27,28]. Whether employees continue to stay in a company is positively related to the support level of the organization. The higher the organizational support level, the higher the employee retention. Therefore, the following hypothesis was proposed: H3 POS has a significant negative correlation with employees' TI in luxury hotels. 3.4 Perceived organizational support and perceived value of artificial intelligence According to organizational support theory, organizations provide various types of support to employees For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, employees considered organizational support crucial [29]. Similar to COVID-19, the rise of AI technology in the hotel industry poses a significant threat to some employees [30]. To combat the impact of COVID-19 and the rise of AI technology on employees, hotel management should provide employees with various types of support. Employees with management support can focus more on the value of AI technology than on its dangers. According to the interpretation of utilitarian value [19], if an organization provides management services related to AI technology to employees to improve their work efficiency, convenience, and save time, then employees will perceive the utilitarian value brought by AI technology. According to the definition of hedonic value [20], employees will experience hedonic value brought about by AI technology if the organization provides AI technology management services intended to make employees feel relaxed, surprised, and fun at work. Therefore, the following hypothesis was derived: H4 POS has a significant positive correlation with PVAI in luxury hotels. 3.5 Perceived value of artificial intelligence and turnover intention Perceived value theory explains the utility individuals obtain from tangible products or intangible services [18]. In marketing, the perceived value obtained through AI is positively correlated with consumer purchase intentions [9]. In human resource management, AI has a positive perceived value that helps retain employees [10]. AI technology is expected to change the management direction of human resources departments because people prefer decisions made by AI technology to those made by humans. Especially in the service-intensive hotel industry, fairness and justice are important influencing factors of resignation and are highly valued by employees [31]. AI decisions seem fair and reflect respect for employees [11]. Therefore, the following hypothesis was derived: H5 PVAI has a significant negative correlation with employees' TI in luxury hotels. 3.6 PVAI as a mediating role Employees face new technological changes almost daily, but their attitudes are the opposite. Some employees welcome the changes brought about by the new technology, whereas others resist and take defensive measures [32]. Anxiety about future careers caused by huge changes in work culture and the environment brought about by new technology is the main reason for turnover intention [33]. With the rapid development of AI technology in the hotel industry, to reduce this anxiety, hotels must provide sufficient support to increase the perceived value of AI. It is necessary to fully consider the mediating factors of employees' perceived AI values between POS and TI. Therefore, the following hypothesis was formulated: H6 PVAI is a significant mediator between POS and TI in luxury hotels. 3.7 Formulation of a conceptual framework Based on the above research, this study proposes a conceptual framework for AI perception (Refer Fig. 1 ) that shows the impact of PTAI on TI in luxury hotels. PTAI is an independent variable and TI is a dependent variable. Between them, POS plays a moderating role. In addition, PVAI, the other side of PTAI, also plays a mediating role in the relationship between POS and TI. 4 Research methodology 4.1 Sample and procedure This study investigated the relationships among PTAI, POS, PVAI, and TI. This study considers that the higher a hotel's star level, the more capable and financial it is to introduce AI technology. Therefore, this study focuses on five-star rated luxury hotels. According to information released by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People's Republic of China, luxury hotels distributed across all 34 administrative regions of China by 2022. Due to geographical constraints and the convenience of the network, this study obtains data from the online platform \u201cSojump\u201d (https://www.sojump.com). This study provided sample collection services for scholars and obtained data from 28 administrative regions in China. First, 30 employees were invited to conduct a pretest to improve the unreasonable aspects of the questionnaire. Then, under the guidance of two university professors, the wording of some items was revised to improve respondents' understanding. This study selected voluntary sampling and collected 628 questionnaires from June to August 2022. Respondents with missing values were eliminated, and the final efficacy rate was 83.3%. To obtain reliable results, the ratio of samples to independent variables (items) should be greater than 10:1 [34]. Therefore, a sample size of 523 was considered sufficient for this study. Table 1 presents the respondents' profile tables. 4.2 Measurement The scale for the study was adopted from the existing literature and modified according to the context of this study. The measurement scale for the PTAI variables was adapted from a six-item scale created in previous studies [23]. The scale consists of two subscales (three items each) measuring perceived susceptibility (PSU) and perceived severity (PSE). POS was measured using a twelve-item scale developed in previous studies [26]. The scale has three subscales: Financial POS (FPOS), Career POS (CPOS), and Adjustment POS (APOS). Each subscale consisted of four items. A nine-item scale was used for the PVAI variable [16]. The first five items belong to perceived utility values (PUV), whereas the last four belong to perceived hedonic values (PHV). A five-item scale developed in previous studies [13] was used as the TI variable. For all 32 items, respondents were asked to evaluate on the 7-point Likert scale, ranging from \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to \u201cstrongly agree,\u201d represented by numbers 1\u20137. Finally, a complete questionnaire suitable for this study was developed. 4.3 Data analysis The data was analyzed using Smart PLS (4.0 version), which is a suitable software for testing a conceptual model [35]. When the data is single-sourced, there is a significant probability of common method variance. Harman's one-factor test can be utilized to check for this possibility. After all 32 items participated in Harman's one-actor test, six unqualified items (FPOS2, FPOS4, PUV2, PHV1, PHV2, and TI5) were identified. After removing them, the KMO value is 0.93, the approximate \u03c72 is 8552.71, the df value is 325, and the P-value is 0.000. The results are summarized in Table 2 . For examining the common method bias [36], Harmon's one factor test was used to test the variables. In exploratory factor analysis, the number of factors was set to 1, and the results showed the cumulative % of Variance (Rotated) was 35.79 (below 40), indicating no significant common method bias in the study data. To consolidate this result, using confirmatory factor analysis to validate again, placing all items in a factor box. The results indicated that the fit indexes of the model cannot meet the standard (Chisq/df = 14.387, GFI = 0.514, RMSEA = 0.160, CFI = 0.524, NFI = 0.507, NNFI = 0.482), which once again indicates that there is no common method bias with the data. After testing for common method bias, an updated Likert scale was administered. Descriptive statistics and normality tests are presented in Table 3 . There are no outliers in the data. The absolute value of kurtosis was less than 10, and the absolute value of skewness was less than 3 [37], indicating that although the data did not have an absolutely normal distribution, it is approximately subject to normality. 5 Results A correlation does not necessarily indicate causation with the intervention [38]. This study applies correlation-based methods (structural equation modeling) to survey data without intervention [39] to better understand the correlation between variables. A two-step approach is used to test the model. The first step was to test the validity and reliability of the measurement model. The second step was to test the hypotheses by analyzing the structural model (also called the inter-model) [40]. The statistical tool selects Smart PLS version 4.0 and uses partial least squares (PLS) modeling technology to test the conceptual framework. PLS-SEM is better for theory development and prediction purposes [40]. 5.1 Measurement model test Validity is the ability of instrument to measure what it supposed to be measured for a construct. There are three types of validity required for each measurement model [41]. 5.1.1 Convergent validity The outer loading (should be \u2265 0.7) is to evaluate the reflection measurement model, the composite reliability (CR) (should be \u2265 0.7) is to evaluate the internal consistency, and the average variance extracted (AVE) (should be \u2265 0.5) is to evaluate the convergent validity [40]. The loadings, AVEs, and CRs of the items listed in Table 4 qualified. PSU and PSE were used to measure the independent variable, PTAI. The moderating variable, POS, was measured using the FPOS, CPOS, and APOS. The mediating variable PVAI was measured using PUV and PHV. 5.1.2 Construct validity It is recommended that the use of at least one fitness index from each category of model fit [41]. The value of Root Mean Square of Error Approximation (RMSEA) should be < 0.08. The values of Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Normed Fit Index (NFI) should all be > 0.9. The value of Chi- Square/Degree of freedom (Chisq/df) should be < 5.0. In Absolute Fit, the value of RMSEA was 0.064 (less than 0.08). In the Incremental Fit, the NFI value was 0.895 (close to 0.9), and all other indexes were within the standard range. In the Parsimonious Fit, the Chisq/df value was 3.149 (less than 5.0). The above indicated that all values of fitness indexes for the model have achieved the required level (Refer Table 5 ). 5.1.3 Discriminant validity Furthermore, this study used the HTMT criterion for validity assessment to test the discriminant validity. HTMT value should be \u2264 0.85 [42]. As shown in Table 6 , the HTMT values were acceptable. Therefore, the respondents understood that all the structures were distinct. 5.2 Results from the structural equation model 5.2.1 Multicollinearity When the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) value is \u2264 3, there is no multicollinearity problem between indicator variables [43]. The results of the inner model were summarized in Table 7 . 5.2.2 Path coefficients This study used 5000 re-sample bootstrapping procedures to assess the PLS path modeling, T-statistics is used to estimate path coefficients [40]. The \u03b2-value represents the path coefficient. BCILL and BCIUL do not span 0, indicating a significant path coefficient [44]. The p-value <0.05 or the 95% confidence interval will achieve significance [40]. In all paths except PTAI * POS - > TI, the path coefficients were shown to be significant. The results were shown in Table 8 . Among all direct relationships, PTAI was positively related to TI (t = 5.444, p < 0.001), POS was negatively related to TI (t = 5.848, p < 0.01), and POS was positively related to PVAI (t = 27.000, p < 0.001). Thus H1 and H3-H5 were supported. For the moderation test, PTAI did not play a moderating role between PTAI and TI (t = 0.026, p > 0.05). Thus H2 was rejected. For the mediation test, the relationship POS - > PVAI - > TI (t = 8.861, p < 0.001) is significant, and a negative relationship is found. To compensate for the deficiency in the significance test, the mediating effect size should be reported in the statistical analysis results. Further calculations showed that the mediating effect size was 49.54% (indirect effect was \u22120.268, direct effect was \u22120.273, and total effect was \u22120.541), corresponding to partial mediation [45]. Thus, H6 was accepted. 5.2.3 Explanatory power, effect size, and the predictive correlation R-squared (R2) is the variance of the endogenous variables that explains the interpretation of the exogenous variables. The R2 value is 0\u20131. The explanatory power of the model changed positively with R2. The R2 values of 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 for endogenous latent variables can be respectively described as weak, moderate or substantial [46]. F-Square (F2) is the change in R2 when an exogenous variable is removed from the model. F2 is effect size ( \u2265 0.02 is small; \u2265 0.15 is medium; \u2265 0.35 is large) [47]. The predictive correlation is expressed as a Q-squared (Q2) to evaluate the model's predictive ability. Q2 is greater than 0 ( \u2265 0 is small; \u2265 0.25 is medium; \u2265 0.50 is large), indicating that the exogenous constructs have predictive relevance for the endogenous construct under consideration [40]. The relevant data were listed in Table 9 . The R2 value of TI was 0.482, which shows that all predictors explained 48.2% of the turnover intention. FPOS has the lowest explanatory power for the model (R2 = 0.320), but it is also sufficient. The F2 values of TI were 0.063 (small level), 0.080 (small level), and 0.175 (medium level), corresponding to PTAI, POS, and PVAI, respectively, whereas the other F2 values were at a large level. The Q2 values of all variables were above 0; among them, FPOS, APOS, and TI were at a medium level, and all others were at a large level. Overall, this model can well reflect the predictive correlation. 5.2.4 Structural equation model Based on the two-step approach, the structural model was obtained. As shown in Fig. 2 . The numbers in the blue circles represent R2. The route of the outer model is indicated by green, and the values outside and inside the brackets are path coefficients, respectively (\u03b2-Value) and T-value. The route of the inner model is shown in black, and the values outside and inside the brackets are the loadings and T-values. 6 Discussion 6.1 Results and comparison This study proposes an AI perception model that includes PTAI, POS, PVAI and TI variables for luxury hotel employees in China. The results are as follows: PTAI has a significant positive effect on TI (H1), POS does not play a significant moderator between PTAI and TI (H2), POS has a significant negative effect on TI (H3) and has a significant positive effect on PTAI (H4), PVAI has a significant negative effect on TI (H5), and PVAI plays a significant partial mediator between POS and TI (H6). The theoretical model proposed in this study was designed from two opposing perspectives on AI perception, which differs from previous models. However, the related hypotheses in previous studies were supported, while H2 in this study was rejected. This is worth discussing. This study rejects H2 (t = 0.026, p > 0.05), which contradicts previous relevant results. This study considered two typical previous studies for comparison. Respondents in the first comparative object (Ref. No. 7) were from five-star rated luxury hotels, as in this study. However, the results were different, which may be related to the research scope and POS scale. The research scope of this study is all over China, whereas the first comparative object focuses on only one province in China. For the POS scale, this study uses 12 items developed in 2004 and 2017 [16,17], whereas the first comparative object uses 8 items developed in 1986 [15]. Some differences were observed between the second comparative object (Ref. No. 5) and this study on respondents (employees of the service sector), research scope (New Zealand), and sample size (only 120). In addition, the TI variable in the comparative study was measured with a 4-item scale developed in 1999 [48]. While this study was measured with a 5-item scale developed in 2019 [7] while considering the same context of the increasing development of AI technology. In these two previous studies, the scale of the variables was proposed for a long time. Therefore, the improved scales of the POS and TI variables used in this study are more suitable for the research needs of modern society with the development of AI technology. Other hypotheses (H1, H3-H6) in this study were supported and achieved consistent results compared to previous studies. H1, based on the technology breakthrough avoidance theory, is supported by the conclusions of previous studies. Previous research fields such as the service sector (Ref. No. 5) have also been validated, indicating that employees' perception of the threat posed by new technology will lead to turnover intention in multiple research fields. For H3-H5, this was common in previous related studies and was successfully supported in this study. Regarding H6, many scholars verified the existence of meaningful mediators between POS and TI. Few studies have considered PVAI as a mediator; however, it was validated based on the perceived value theory in this study. Compared to previous studies, the similarity lies in the presence of significant mediators, whereas the difference lies in validating a new mediator in this study. 6.2 Implications This study has important implications for luxury hotel management. First, hotel employees' perceptions of AI are dual. Employees have different perceptions of AI owing to their different life experiences. Suppose hotel managers focus on enhancing employees' perceived value of AI and dispel concerns about the threats posed by AI technology through education and training. In this case, the employees' turnover intentions changed. Second, luxury hotel managers should consider POS to be a key variable. Although POS has not yet been validated as a moderating variable between PTAI and TI, there are signs of a weakening relationship between POS and PTAI. More importantly, POS directly and significantly affects TI and PVAI, respectively. Therefore, if hotel managers can provide high-level support to employees in terms of changing management policies and leadership styles when hotel employees are facing AI threats, they will feel more satisfied and loyal to their hotels. 6.3 Theoretical and practical contribution The theoretical significance lies in the development of a theoretical model that can fill this research gap. This theoretical framework combines technology threat avoidance theory, organizational support theory, and perceived value theory, which reflect the impact of the perceived threat of AI on turnover intention through perceived organizational support and perceived value of AI in luxury hotels in China. Its practical significance lies for luxury hotels and their employees. With the gradual application of artificial intelligence technology in luxury hotels, this study provides recommendations for hotel management to address the threat of artificial intelligence technology, namely providing high-level organizational support to employees, psychologically helping them reduce their willingness to leave luxury hotels due to significant changes in the work environment and the anxiety of future careers caused by artificial intelligence threats. For luxury hotels, the most direct benefit was increased employee retention. Indirect benefits include saving recruitment and education costs, improving service quality, and increasing creativity. The most direct benefit for hotel employees is good career growth, whereas the indirect benefits are acquiring new skills used by AI, increasing the sense of achievement, and so on. 6.4 Limitations and future research This study has some limitations. First, this study used cross-sectional data, which may have affected the relationships. In future research, panel data, which combines cross-sectional data with time series data, will be used to make the data analysis results more convincing. Second, it should have considered whether the respondents' organizational environments have already introduced AI systems. In future research, it will be necessary to classify whether luxury hotels have applied AI systems to reflect respondents' feelings more accurately. Third, questionnaire development and research instruments must be adjusted to include hotel-specific items. As few scholars have developed questionnaires on the PTAI and PVAI, the items in this study were adapted from previous questionnaires. Therefore, adjusting hotel-specific items to a level recognized by academia is a future research direction. Fourth, PTAI and PVAI were proposed based on two different theories, and this study did not initially consider the relationship between them. PTAI and PVAI should have a correlation by their definitions. In future research, this relationship will be necessary to verify to increase the completeness of this model. 7 Conclusion The aim of the study is to examine the relationship between the perceived threat of artificial intelligence and turnover intention through perceived organizational support and perceived value of artificial intelligence. The data consists of employees of luxury hotels in China. This study proposes a conceptual model of artificial intelligence perception and six hypotheses. After verification, the findings were as follows: The perceived threat of artificial intelligence directly affects turnover intention; Perceived organizational support directly affects the perceived value of artificial intelligence and turnover intention, respectively; The perceived value of artificial intelligence directly affects turnover intention and plays a significant partial mediator (effect size is 49.54%) between perceived organizational support and turnover intention. These findings are reflected in the theory, methods, and hotel management in the context of the increasing development of artificial intelligence technology in hotels and high turnover rate of hotel employees. Theoretically, this study proposes a conceptual model of artificial intelligence perception. The combination of technology threat avoidance, organizational support, and perceived value theories applies to the research background of this study. This not only expands the application scope of this theoretical combination, but also finds suitable supporting theories for this study. Methodologically, the relationship between the perceived threat of artificial intelligence, perceived organizational support, the perceived value of artificial intelligence, and turnover intention was studied together for the first time, and the perceived value of artificial intelligence was discovered as a new significant mediator between perceived organizational support and turnover intention. With regard to the threat of artificial intelligence to employees, the perceived organizational support of hotel managers should be emphasized, especially in the areas of finance, career, and adaptation.

Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre, Sun Yat-sen University 7# Jinsui Road, Guangzhou Guangdong 510623 China Medical artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technology have rapidly advanced in recent years, and they are now routinely used for image-based diagnosis. China has a massive amount of medical data. However, a uniform criteria for medical data quality have yet to be established. Therefore, this review aimed to develop a standardized and detailed set of quality criteria for medical data collection, storage, annotation, and management related to medical AI. This would greatly improve the process of medical data resource sharing and the use of AI in clinical medicine. Keywords Artificial intelligence Big data Intelligent medicine Data collection Data storage Data annotation Data management 1 Introduction Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) has been incorporated into medicine, which can make diagnosis more accurate and speed up the diagnosis and treatment processes [1]. With the development of AI in medicine, many algorithms have been developed and applied. As an emerging field of research, AI in medicine still has many details that need to be standardized to support higher-quality research. Recently, successive guidelines have been issued to regulate clinical trial reports for interventions involving medical AI, in order to improve the reporting of these trials [2\u20133]. In addition to standardizing the reporting of trials of medical AI, standardizing data preparation before medical AI algorithm development is also necessary. Medical big data, which represent the driving force of medical AI algorithm training, have the characteristics of rich types, a wide range of disciplines, and high dependence on people with medical background for annotation. Although many studies on algorithms briefly described their data preparation processes, the quality of these processes varies and there is insufficient detail for repeat experiments to be conducted in related fields. In addition, the application of AI in clinical medicine faces many challenges, including developing curated patient datasets of sufficient quality, explaining the intended use for the AI intervention to other healthcare personnel and researchers, and issues related to data sharing [4]. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize the whole process of medical data preprocessing, including collection, storage, annotation, and management of data on specific diseases, prior to algorithm training. It is anticipated that AI can help medical resources to be used scientifically and rationally, and that AI will be further promoted in the medical field. Note: This guideline was developed with the Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence and the Medical Artificial Intelligence Branch of Guangdong Medical Association. The criteria were drafted according to the directives for preparing standards provided in GB/T 1.1-2009 [5]. 2 Basic requirements 2.1 Privacy policy Clinical data related to recognizable facial feature information, such as corneal reflection data, should be desensitized. Sensitive personal information that does not affect the disease diagnosis, such as phone number and home address, should also be desensitized. 2.2 Data quality The original data should not be edited or compressed. 2.3 Professional requirements The physicians responsible for data collection should have a license for practicing medicine and relevant qualifications. And they should completed residency training. They should also have received specialized training on the subjects related to the specific types of data that will be used. 2.4 Environmental requirements Environmental factors that affect data collection, storage, and annotation should be avoided. 2.5 Equipment and operator requirements Equipment is essential for medical data collection. It should be operated, maintained, cleaned, and managed correctly by dedicated personnel. Before starting to work, operators should be familiar with the equipment performance and application methods, which should involve rigorous training. 3 Standards for common medical data collection There are several types of medical data [6]: (A) Text data mainly include outpatient and inpatient medical history records, health examination records, and statutory medical certificate reports. All of these records should include the patients\u2019 hospitalization or outpatient number and basic information such as name, gender, age, and examination date. The health examination records should include all examination items and complete results. The statutory medical certificate reports should include all types of statutory medical certificate information issued by the medical institution and all types of information reported to the relevant business department, such as the court and health insurance bureau, according to law. (B) Image data mainly include two-dimensional (2D) images generated by X-ray, ultrasound, or electroencephalography, and three-dimensional (3D) images generated by computed tomography (CT) or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All image data should be linked to patients\u2019 basic information. The image data generated by different equipment should be collected in a uniform format and with uniform attributes (such as resolution and contrast ratio). (C) Video data mainly involve examination videos recorded by doctors, which can be stored in formats such as Audio Video Interleaved (AVI), RealMedia Variable Bitrate (RMVB), and Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Uniform attributes regarding encoding, resolution, code rate, and frame rate should be used among the videos. (D) Other data include audio medical data and four-dimensional (4D) image data. The preparation of patients before data collection and the use of data collection equipment should be standardized according to the formal clinical data collection requirements. For example, producing standardized images means that quality problems due to overexposure, underexposure, and unclearness should be avoided. 4 Standards for common medical data storage Regarding image storage format types, the selection is influenced by the network and framework used to develop the AI systems. For example, corneal light-reflection images for diagnosing strabismus are saved in JPEG format, while digital pathology images for diagnosing retinoblastoma are saved in TIFF format. The section should also take the long-term accessibility, storage, and sharing limits related to the data into account. Table 1 shows, for each type of data, the storage format and the storage method for the associated data. 5 Standards for common medical data preprocessing 5.1 Data cleaning Data cleaning mainly focuses on data quality issues, including repetitive, incomplete, and abnormal data, and it involves the following steps [7]: (A) Preparation: develop a complete data cleaning plan based on the data analysis demands; (B) Detection: identify similar, repetitive, incomplete, and/or abnormal records, and logical mistakes; (C) Location and amendment: locate the data problems and then analyze, clarify, and correct the data; (D) Verification: verify whether the cleaned data is suitable for the training task. If the dataset does not match the analysis task, previous cleaning steps need to be run again. Data cleaning can be restarted or stopped at any step. 5.2 Lost data preprocessing [8] 5.2.1 Deletion When missing items represent only a small proportion of the whole dataset, deletion is one of the easiest and effective ways to deal with the issue. Common deletion methods include listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, and single deletion. However, deleting a larger amount of the original data can represent a considerable waste of data resources, and it will cause the missing and incomplete of information. In particular, if the sample size is small, deleting even a small amount of data would likely damage the objectivity of the dataset and the validity of the dataset and outcomes. In general, when missing data account for a significant proportion of the dataset, particularly when the missing data are distributed non-randomly, there may be deviations between the results of the deletion process and the actual situation, and this can lead to invalid conclusions. 5.2.2 Weighted adjustment Weighted adjustment includes weighted estimation of the mean, biased weighting, and weighting using a generalized estimating equation (GEE). Weighting is a simple way to minimize deviations. However, incorrect results may occur when there is a large sample size because of lack of an internal control for variance. Because these artificial data are not the data generated in the real, objective world. 5.2.3 Single imputation There are several methods that can be used to create a replacement for each missing datum, including mean imputation, regression imputation, hot-deck imputation, and cold-deck imputation. However, the imputed dataset cannot take into account the uncertainty regarding the original missing data, as all the imputed data are identical. This may lead to large deviations between the single imputation results and the actual situation. 5.2.4 Multiple imputation A set of possible imputation values, which can reflect the uncertainty regarding the original missing data, is created for each missing datum. Each imputation value is adopted, and the corresponding complete datasets are created. All the datasets are then analyzed, and the final statistical outcome is produced based on the synthesis of the results from all datasets. This method takes the uncertainty regarding original missing data into account, but deviations between the multiple imputation results and the actual situation are inevitable as the method regards the missing data as random samples. 6 Standards for common medical data annotation 6.1 Annotator requirements and data distribution for annotation 6.1.1 Annotator requirements Junior, revisor, and reviewer annotators should be trained, assessed, and certified by a training center with assessment qualifications. They should also obtain certificates corresponding to specific specialties and disease types. Junior annotators refers to clinicians who have worked in their specialty for more than 3 years; revisor annotators refers to clinicians who have worked in their specialty for more than 5 years or have become an attending physician or above; reviewer annotators refers to clinicians who have worked in their specialty for more than 10 years or have become an associate chief physician or above. 6.1.2 Data distribution for annotation and task assignment To avoid bias, data should be distributed randomly by computers. There are four levels of annotators: junior annotators, revisor annotators, reviewer annotators, and administrators. The administrators assign tasks to annotators at all levels and spot check the progress regularly. If the administrators find problems with the annotation, they will require the annotators to relabel the data. Additionally, the administrators have the right to modify the annotation according to standards and changes in the labeling hierarchy. The administrators will distribute the data to multiple annotation groups, which the administrators manage blindly. Each group has two data distribution options: crossing annotation in the group or three-level annotation (\u201cjunior\u2013revisor\u2013reviewer\u201d). The former, which is illustrated in Figure 1 , can minimize data bias and is recommended for machine learning tasks involving image classification. The latter, which is illustrated in Figure 2 , is recommended for machine learning tasks involving image segmentation or target detection. At the first level, the image data are distributed to three annotators. The annotators annotate according to the specific requirements. If the annotations are agreed upon, they are inputted into the training set and the annotation process ends. If there is disagreement, two more revisor annotators (second-level) are added and the five annotations are then combined. If the combined label is consistent with the third-party verification platform (a platform independent of the medical researchers and algorithm engineers), the label is inputted into the training set. If there is disagreement, the reviewer annotator (third-level) determines whether it will be inputted into the training set and then the annotation process ends. At the first level, the image data are distributed to the junior annotators and annotated according to the specific requirements. At the second level, the junior annotators submit the labeled data to the revisor annotators. If the labeling requires modifications, it is returned to the junior annotator for modification with amendment comments; if the labeling basically meets the requirements, the junior annotator's labeling is accepted. At the third level, the revisor annotators submit the labeled data to the reviewer annotators. If no modifications are required, the data are inputted into the training set; otherwise, the labeling is returned to the revisor annotator for modification with amendment comments. 6.2 Annotation rules Figure 3 shows the overall flow regarding how to label image data distributed to annotators. The detailed annotation process involves the following five steps [9]: (A) Identifying machine learning tasks First, clarify the sub-fields of deep learning tasks required, such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and generalized deep learning; second, clarify the algorithm types involved in these deep learning tasks, such as supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Based on the above two points, determine whether data labeling is necessary. (B) Determining the data type The data type needs to be clearly defined based on each required deep learning task. Computer vision focuses on 2D images, 3D images, and videos, while natural language processing focuses on electronic health records. (C) Determining the annotation method The annotation method should be chosen based on each required deep learning task. Computer vision can deal with object classification, detection, segmentation, etc., while natural language processing can deal with machine translation, text generation, image captioning, etc. (D) Determining the label hierarchical relationships Before labeling, the hierarchical relationships should be expressed in the form of a network or tree diagram according to the subject knowledge system. (E) Determining the label and image storage type The choice of label and image storage type are based on the network and framework used in the AI system construction. 6.3 Annotation tools and platforms The annotation tools should be easy to operate and have the following functions, as required: (A) Image loading; (B) Image enhancement processing; (C) Image enlargement, reduction, and rotation; (D) Treatmentannotation; (E) Disease annotation; (F) Use of a ruler for image measurement; (G) Image contrast enhancement processing; (H) Multi category annotation and customizable category attributes; (I) Hiding, visualizing, adding, deleting, and copying annotations; (J) Interactive annotation; (K) Saving and exporting annotated images, including contour line or point coordinates. The annotation platforms should involve table-like software such as Excel, in order to allow convenient ability to statistically analyze each labeled image. 7 Standards for medical database management 7.1 Database management and maintenance The explosive growth of data means that requirements for database construction are becoming increasingly stringent. This can lead to a series of problems, the most important of which is data security, which persistently plagues database administrators [10]. Generally, a database security threat is either a software or hardware security threat. The risks to software security come from computer virus attacks, information system errors, unauthorized data access and operations, etc. The risks to hardware security come from computer hardware failures, accidental damage to data storage carriers, etc. To deal with these problems, a series of reasonable and scientific measures must be taken to ensure that the database operates efficiently, smoothly, and safely. 7.1.1 Establishment of database security management system It is necessary to establish an efficient and scientific security management system to ensure the security, integrity, and validity of the data, so as to improve data utilization efficiency and strengthen data management. To establish a database security management system, the operational processes should be standardized at all levels in detail to clarify management responsibilities and accountability mechanisms. This will help to prevent database security incidents caused by various human factors. The essential points that should be emphasized are: (A) Clarify specific measures for database operation and management security, such as data backup, data encryption, data authority management, data transmission security, and data inspection. (B) Clarify database management responsibilities and establish accountability and punishment systems. (C) Establish an emergency safety plan to deal with all types of sudden database security incidents. 7.1.2 Specific measures for data management (A) Database architecture design Particularly for large databases, a carefully considered design is key because it can accelerate data processing, minimize errors, and maximize work efficiency, which all need to be taken into account at the beginning of database construction. The following requirements should be considered: (a) data security and disaster tolerance requirements; (b) maintenance requirements; (c) expansion requirements; (d) high accessibility requirements; and (e) cost and capacity (performance and storage) balance requirements [11]. (B) Network security The Internet plays an irreplaceable role in improving the efficiency of data sharing and utilization. However, if the platform connects to the Internet and provides data sharing services, it is equivalent to turning an internal closed network into an open network and various security issues will likely arise. Thus, several types of network security prevention technologies (including firewalls, digital signatures, authentication, and intrusion detection) are essential [12]. (C) User identification and authority management Identity authentication, or verification, refers to identity confirmation by the database managers in order to allow a user access and usage rights to a given database. Nowadays, the size of databases and the number of access requests are growing rapidly. The establishment of a database authority management system is particularly important for data security, utilization efficiency, and platform management [13]. (D) Regular database self-checks To ensure safety, it is necessary to carry out regular platform self-checks, find security vulnerabilities, and deal with them promptly. Additionally, database managers should pay attention to the database environment, log records, and database maintenance content. 7.2 Database utilization 7.2.1 Database usage specifications 7.2.1.1 Online database usage specifications (A) Without permission, the transmission of data, research results, and database access passwords to an unauthorized person is prohibited. (B) Storing multiple databases on a single MySQL server is forbidden. Normally, one database is used for each research project, avoiding mutual interference. (C) Performing background management and statistical function queries using the main library is forbidden due to the increased burden on the central processing unit (CPU) and the effects on database usage. (D) Batch data cleaning needs to be evaluated by both the developers and the database managers, which should be done during off-peak hours. The database service status should be monitored during this process. (E) Conducting database stress tests online is forbidden. (F) Storing clear text passwords in the database is forbidden. (G) The upload size of data cannot exceed the maximum size of the database (H) The Database Management Committee should be notified in a timely manner if the database does not work or data are lost. (I) The data should be transmitted through a dedicated network. (J) In principle, it is forbidden to modify, move, add, or delete any data. If any of these functions are required, the Database Management Committee must provide signed approval before execution. 7.2.1.2 Offline database usage specifications (A) Uploading data to online backup services is forbidden. (B) Sharing the data with individuals who have not been approved by the Database Management Committee is forbidden. (C) The Database Management Committee should be notified in a timely manner if the database does not work or data are lost. (D) In principle, it is forbidden to modify, move, add, or delete any data. If any of these functions are required, an offline backup should be created before execution. 7.2.2 Data security and ethical issues 7.2.2.1 Data security In many cases, it is difficult to ensure the safety of data. Many information technologies have security vulnerabilities, leading to data leakage, forgery, distortion, and other problems [14]. Furthermore, improper usage of big data and related high-tech criminal activities are also significant information security issues. 7.2.2.2 Ethical issues Medical big data are becoming more common, and ethical issues should not be ignored [15]. (A) A subject whose data is actively generated or passively left has the right to know, store, utilize, and delete their information. However, the process of data collection is usually automatic, so the subjects are often unaware of it. There is a possibility that the data collection process may invade subject's privacy, since it might be misused against the subject's will [16]. (B) The collected data might be untrue or distorted, resulting in untrustworthy analysis and AI systems. For example, if an individual does not want to share their data, there may be situations involving concealing or providing false data, resulting in inaccurate electronichealth records [17]. (C) Some researchers may have access to large-scale and high-quality data resources, while others have difficulty accessing these data resources. These gaps may lead to the unfair distribution of information dividends and aggravate group differences and social inequities. 7.2.3 Emergency plan for security incidents Regarding vulnerabilities related to network security, good governance can reduce social and legal risks caused by security incidents such as attacks, data leakage, and service interruption. The emergency plan for security incidents should include: (A) clarifying the responsibilities of each subdivision of troubleshooting personnel; (B) establishing an emergency alert system; and (C) regularly carrying out fault inspection and system repair. 8 Summary To utilize medical data to its full extent for the development and transformation of medical AI algorithms, it is urgent to standardize the collection of medical data and improve resource sharing mechanisms. This paper standardizes the processes regarding preparing medical data before algorithm training and puts forward recommendations related to medical AI. The quality of medical data can be made more uniform by regulating data collection, storage, annotation, and management. The steps outlined in this review will help to make experiments repeatable, develop high-quality datasets, and promote higher-quality medical AI research. This will help to develop AI for application in clinical settings. As the types of medical data that we discussed were limited, we only formulated preliminary standards. Additionally, it is important to note that, unlike other medical interventions, medical AI systems can yield unpredictable errors that are not easily detectable or explainable based on human judgement. Therefore, in the future, we will develop improved standards by considering more specific types of clinical and non-clinical data. In the future, we believe that medical AI will be widely applied in clinical settings to detect, diagnose, and triage medical conditions using well-established standards [18].

Hindocha, UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, UK. UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Imperial College London London SW7 2AZ UK Aims Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the radiotherapy workflow, resulting in improved quality, safety, accuracy and timeliness of radiotherapy delivery. Several commercially available artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring tools have emerged in recent years. Their clinical deployment raises important considerations for clinical oncologists, including quality assurance and validation, education, training and job planning. Despite this, there is little in the literature capturing the views of clinical oncologists with respect to these factors. Materials and Methods The Royal College of Radiologists realises the transformational impact artificial intelligence is set to have on our specialty and has appointed the Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Oncology working group. The aim of this work was to survey clinical oncologists with regards to perceptions, current use of and barriers to using artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring for radiotherapy. Here we share our findings with the wider clinical and radiation oncology communities. We hope to use these insights in developing support, guidance and educational resources for the deployment of auto-contouring for clinical use, to help develop the case for wider access to artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring across the UK and to share practice from early-adopters. Results In total, 78% of clinical oncologists surveyed felt that artificial intelligence would have a positive impact on radiotherapy. Attitudes to risk were more varied, but 49% felt that artificial intelligence will decrease risk for patients. There is a marked appetite for urgent guidance, education and training on the safe use of such tools in clinical practice. Furthermore, there is a concern that the adoption and implementation of such tools is not equitable, which risks exacerbating existing inequalities across the country. Conclusion Careful coordination is required to ensure that all radiotherapy departments, and the patients they serve, may enjoy the benefits of artificial intelligence in radiotherapy. Professional organisations, such as the Royal College of Radiologists, have a key role to play in delivering this. Keywords Auto-segmentation Artificial intelligence Barriers Perceptions Radiotherapy Introduction Radiotherapy is a major treatment modality for cancer, utilised with either curative or palliative intent in over 50% of all cases [1\u20133]. Recent decades have seen the introduction of more complex, technologically advanced radiotherapy aimed at improving survival and reducing toxicity [1,2,4,5]. Despite these advances, several time-consuming manual steps that directly impact on treatment quality remain embedded within the radiotherapy workflow [1,6]. The introduction of more complex radiotherapy, increasing cancer incidence and, more acutely, a pandemic-related backlog in some countries, have contributed to service delivery pressures facing health systems. Clinical oncology workforce shortages, as described in the Royal College of Radiologists' (RCR) recent clinical oncology UK workforce census report [1,7] only serve to exacerbate such pressures. Artificial intelligence, the use of complex computer algorithms that perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, continues to impact several areas of health care, from drug discovery to service delivery [8,9]. Within clinical oncology, artificial intelligence may have the potential to transform several segments of the radiotherapy workflow, resulting in improved quality, standardisation, safety, accuracy and timeliness of radiotherapy delivery [1,6,10]. As the body representing clinical oncologists, the RCR realises the transformational impact artificial intelligence is set to have on our specialty and has appointed the Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Oncology (AICO) working group. Members of this group have clinical and research interests across various aspects of artificial intelligence and digital health technology, including imaging, treatment planning, data collection/analysis and artificial intelligence modelling to support and advance the RCR's artificial intelligence agenda. At present, manual contouring of organs at risk (OARs), primary tumour and involved nodal regions is perhaps the most laborious, but crucial, component of the clinical oncologist's role. Errors in this process can lead to underdosing of the tumour or increased toxicity, with resultant effects on survival and quality of life. Atlas-based contouring tools are limited by availability and accuracy and still require significant manual input [1,11\u201314]. Advances in artificial intelligence domains, such as machine learning and computer vision, have led to the development of methods for accurate and efficient auto-contouring [15]. Indeed, in a survey of medical physicists, auto-contouring was felt to be one of the most popular artificial intelligence supported applications [16]. In a survey of therapeutic radiographers, responses ranked auto-contouring second only to treatment planning as the area of radiography where artificial intelligence would have the most value [17]. In recent years, artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring tools have migrated from the domain of research to commercially available products [1,6,16]. Although such products may represent ideal solutions to the problems described above, their clinical deployment raises several important considerations for clinical oncologists, including quality assurance and validation, education and training and job planning. Despite this, there is little in the literature capturing the views of clinical oncologists with respect to these factors. The aim of this work was to survey UK clinical oncologists with regards to perceptions, current use of and barriers to using artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring for radiotherapy, to share our findings with the wider clinical and radiation oncology communities and to use these insights in developing support, guidance and educational resources for the deployment of auto-contouring for clinical use, to help develop the case for wider access to artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring across the UK and to share practice from early-adopters. Materials and Methods Survey questions were developed by AICO and consisted of a mixture of close-ended questions and open-ended statements with options to select. Free-text comments were invited where further information was deemed necessary (Table 1 ). The RCR's Data, Audits and Surveys team advised on changes to avoid bias. The survey was conducted through the RCR Insights Panel and was sent to trainees, Specialty and Associate Specialist (SAS) doctors and consultants in current employment (not retired) across the UK and oversees within the Faculty of Clinical Oncology. The survey ran from 08:30 6 June to 23:59 12 June 2022. Responders were not incentivised. Free text comments were reviewed by the lead author and grouped into common categories. Responses were analysed with descriptive statistics. Results The survey was sent to 236 members of the Faculty of Clinical Oncology that had subscribed to the RCR's Insights Panel. Fifty-one responded, giving a response rate of 22% (\u226520% is considered acceptable by the Insights Panel), which is in keeping with other recent Insights Panel surveys (response rate range 21\u201327%). Forty respondents (78%) were consultants, seven (14%) were trainees and three (6%) were of another grade. Fifty (98%) practiced within the National Health Service or an overseas equivalent, six (12%) in a university or academic setting and five (10%) in the private sector. Forty-four respondents (85%) provided their hospital. These were grouped into regions (Table 2 ). Response rates for individual questions are presented in Table 1. Perceived Impact of Artificial Intelligence-Based Auto-Contouring for Clinical Oncologists and Patients When asked about the impact artificial intelligence will have on radiotherapy practice, 40 respondents (78%) felt that this would be positive. None felt that artificial intelligence would replace their role and only one (2%) felt the impact would be negative. Three (6%) felt the impact would be non-significant and seven (14%) did not know. With respect to risk for patients, 25 respondents (49%) felt that the use of artificial intelligence in radiotherapy would decrease risk and 11 (22%) felt there would be no change in risk to patients. Two (4%) felt that artificial intelligence would increase the risk to patients and 13 (25%) did not know. Current Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Auto-Contouring We asked respondents to identify the percentage of OAR contouring that was carried out by artificial intelligence or various staff within their department (Figure 1 ). Nineteen respondents (37%) reported that consultants undertook \u226560% of all OAR contouring. Forty-five respondents (96%) reported that trainees undertook \u226440% of all OAR contouring, with 12 (26%) reporting that trainees did no OAR contouring. Interestingly, two respondents reported that artificial intelligence auto-contouring was used for most OAR contouring in two departments (between 41 and 60% of all cases in one department and 61 and 80% in the other). Twenty-three respondents (45%) reported that artificial intelligence auto-contouring was being used clinically in their departments. Four (8%) reported it was used only for research and eight (16%) stated that although it was not currently being used, their department plans to introduce it within the next year. Where artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring was being used, this was predominantly for OAR contouring and most commonly for head and neck, brain, thorax and prostate radiotherapy. Three respondents reported that artificial intelligence auto-contouring was being used for thoracic, prostate and bladder tumour contouring in their departments (Table 3 ). Twenty-five respondents replied to the question regarding how much time artificial intelligence auto-contouring saved in a typical week. Sixty per cent (15) reported a time saving, with 8% (two) reporting this to be up to 30 min, 16% (four) between 30 min and 1 h and 36% (nine) reporting this to be over 1 h per week. Six (24%) reported that artificial intelligence made no time saving. None reported that artificial intelligence delayed their contouring. Key Priorities and Views Regarding Artificial Intelligence for the Royal College of Radiologists We also asked respondents what they thought the key priorities and learning points regarding artificial intelligence should be for the RCR and to share any other comments on their views or experience with artificial intelligence for auto-contouring. These were distilled into five categories. (i) Validation and quality assurance Respondents expressed the need for robust quality assurance and validation of auto-contouring tools, ensuring that appropriate safety checks are available for artificial intelligence-generated contours. One comment suggested the \u2018ability to check [clinical target volume] contours versus \u2018gold-standard\u2019 adaptive measures'. Another suggested reviews of learning, audit of outcomes and evaluation of the impact of processes within their department would be helpful. (ii) Education, training and guidance Others highlighted the requirement for guidance to be provided to clinical oncologists, especially if they are expected to take clinical responsibility for artificial intelligence solutions. Published guidance should include advice on the use and regulation of auto-contouring and awareness of the pitfalls and limitations associated with auto-contouring. Respondents also wanted guidance on \u2018the balance between reliance on [artificial intelligence] and the on-going need for professional clinical judgement\u2019. One respondent commented that it is \u2018important to have [an] adequate learning dataset and be aware of limitations\u2019 and for clinical oncologists to \u2018use [artificial intelligence] as a tool but do not over rely on it\u2019. Another commented on a \u2018real risk of complacency by the user\u2019 and that \u2018guidance needs to be in place to check the radiotherapy volumes are directed to patient history and that mistakes do not happen\u2019. A range of comments highlighted appetite for formal training on how to use artificial intelligence tools. There are a variety of training needs, from some respondents looking for basic training, \u2018I don't know anything about it \u2013 so [the RCR] need [s] to educate us all!\u2018, \u2018I have little experience in using [artificial intelligence] auto-contouring tools; formal training will be helpful\u2019, to more practical applications, \u2018More teaching on how to incorporate it in clinical practice, in practical terms\u2019 and \u2018Every clinical oncologist and radiologist should embrace [artificial intelligence] but also be equipped to understand how to use it optimally in clinical practice\u2019. A number of responses expressed concern regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on retaining our own radiotherapy planning skills and on training future oncologists, \u2018we need to be careful that when left to do the things that [artificial intelligence] can't do, we haven't lost expertise because of doing much less than previously\u2019, \u2018we need to be careful to ensure that SpRs continue to know the basics of OAR (and GTV etc) contouring - consultants of the future must know how to contour otherwise we won't be able to deal with issues with auto-contouring\u2019 and \u2018robust training should be created to ensure trainees retain skill in interpretation of cross-sectional anatomy\u2019. (iii) Understanding the impact on clinical oncologists Most comments received related to how artificial intelligence would impact on the clinical oncologist's work. These were overwhelmingly positive, with a view that artificial intelligence would save time. - \u2018It does need reviewing and editing but still saves time\u2019 - \u2018Having trialled systems, [artificial intelligence] for OARs is definitely the future in terms of consistency and reducing contouring times\u2019 - \u2018Purely from efficiency, [artificial intelligence] will improve overall work time, especially regarding OARs\u2019 - \u2018Aids workflow efficiency especially if limited planning time\u2019 - \u2018Improved efficiency in planning and delivery of radiotherapy\u2019 Other responses were more sceptical, highlighting the need to ensure that artificial intelligence \u2018actually reduces workload and doesn't just add extra checking\u2019 or that it \u2018does not create delays or more work\u2019. Comments included, \u2018I suspect, as with many changes, this will have both good and bad, hence me not being remotely sure about whether things will get better or worse overall\u2019. Two comments speculated on how the clinical oncologist's role might change with the introduction of artificial intelligence, \u2018freeing up time for clinical oncologists to develop new skills and activities\u2019 and \u2018the role of clinical oncologist will be to edit artificial intelligence generated volumes\u2019. Key priorities for the RCR in this category were felt to be \u2018to best understand the direct/indirect, positive/negative consequences of the impact on clinicians (e.g. job planning) and where necessary make recommendations about mitigation\u2019. For the use of artificial intelligence in clinical oncology in general, one respondent felt priorities should be \u20181. Peer review tools and consensus on cases, 2. OAR outlining, 3. Pathway streamlining (for example scheduling chemoradiotherapy)\u2019. Beyond auto-contouring, respondents speculated on how artificial intelligence might improve clinical oncology in the future, \u2018we should be looking at opportunities for a 10\u201315-year time horizon: plan data combined with patient reported outcome measures and disease outcome data fed-back into datasets to help clinical decision making: e.g. would this patient be better served by protons vs photons or radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy? Machine vendors are already looking at these potential solutions and we should partner with them\u2019, \u2018linking artificial intelligence to clinical outcomes and normal tissue complication probability would fully realise benefits of [artificial intelligence]\u2019 and \u2018artificial intelligence will also allow for effective radiomic data to be collected to better understand/audit [radiotherapy] volumes and plans by correlating to outcomes in patients\u2019. (iv) Patient engagement Two comments related to the responsibility of the RCR and clinical oncologists to reassure patients that artificial intelligence -based auto-contouring is safe and effective and to make clear where the clinical responsibility for artificial intelligence auto-contouring lies, \u2018patients should know who is in control of the auto-contouring\u2019. (v) Rolling out clinical artificial intelligence tools for radiotherapy Additional comments related to the introduction of clinical artificial intelligence tools for radiotherapy and the perceived role the RCR might play in this. Several respondents commented on the need for widespread equitable access to artificial intelligence technology for all departments across the country. Respondents felt that a national approach, possibly coordinated by the RCR, would be helpful to achieve proper implementation and verification, \u2018validation takes time and implementation could be sped up if it was done collaboratively/nationally (e.g. with the support of the RCR). We have never done this at scale before and have missed opportunities, e.g. for machine commissioning to be done by regional teams to allow local physics teams to continue clinical work\u2019. It was also felt that as \u2018investment and funding availability is crucial\u2019, the RCR should \u2018lobby the government for a separate pot [of money] for clinical radiotherapy improvement rather than the single which will mostly fund radiology\u2019. Also, that, \u2018the RCR needs to push and stimulate departments into using auto-contouring software. With the current workforce shortage and levels of burnout, anything that can help reduce contouring time needs to be trialled and implemented as a matter of priority\u2019. Discussion This report provides useful insight on views of consultant and non-consultant grade clinical oncologists across a wide geography towards the perceptions, current use of and barriers towards artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring in radiotherapy. The results will be valuable in developing further support, guidance and educational resources for the deployment of clinical artificial intelligence tools, to help develop the case for wider access to artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring and to identify early-adopters who may be able to share learning with the wider clinical and radiation oncology communities. Prior studies have reported on the views of 213 medical physicists across Europe [16], 77 therapeutic radiographers from the UK [17] and a multidisciplinary group including 15 radiation oncologists from New Zealand [18]. However, these have focused on the impact of artificial intelligence on radiation oncology in general rather than artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring and we have been unable to find prior studies reporting specifically on the views of clinical/radiation oncologists. Our findings contribute to the literature and compliment prior work by identifying areas of synergy where our different specialties may work together to deliver the safe clinical deployment of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is no longer \u2018on the horizon\u2019. Forty-five per cent of respondents were already using artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring tools for clinical work. Although this was mainly for OAR contouring, respondents reported using artificial intelligence for tumour contours in prostate, thorax and bladder. This is further reflected by the study of European medical physicists, where 37% reported using artificial intelligence in clinical practice, predominantly for contouring and treatment planning [16]. This highlights the urgent need for clear validation and quality assurance measures, as well as guidance, education and training on the safe use of artificial intelligence, its limitations and how to navigate pitfalls. This is further reflected in the free-text comments in response to key priorities for the RCR with regards to artificial intelligence in radiotherapy. Furthermore, although artificial intelligence has entered the radiotherapy arena, this does not appear to be universal, with disparate experience levels across centres. The drivers for this are not well understood and are likely to be multifactorial, e.g. due to resourcing, staffing and complacency. There is a danger for this to exacerbate health inequalities, for example with centres affected by these barriers being the last to adopt artificial intelligence and therefore the last to reap potential efficiency and other benefits. Careful planning is required to ensure widespread equitable access to artificial intelligence technology for all departments within health systems nationally. Overall attitudes of respondents were largely in favour of artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring, with 78% reporting it would have a positive impact on their practice, for example by reducing time spent contouring and freeing up more time for other activities. These views are in keeping with those of medical physicists, therapeutic radiographers and radiation oncologists [16\u201318]. Opinions around risk for patients was more varied, however. Forty-nine per cent felt that auto-contouring would decrease risk due to faster, higher quality or more consistent contours. There seems to be some potential for auto-contouring to save time, with 60% of respondents saying it saves anywhere from 30 min to over 1 h per week. This has also been reported by Lustberg et al. [19]. Although artificial intelligence has been proposed as a solution to workforce shortages and burnout, it is crucial to note its limitations within this context. Developers and commissioners must ensure that tools do save time rather than increasing workload due to excess review of artificial intelligence-generated volumes. There is a danger of exacerbating burnout if the time saved by artificial intelligence is only allocated towards more complex case management or higher case volume, rather than patient-facing time, professional development or teaching. The survey was only sent to members of the RCR's Faculty of Clinical Oncology who were currently in-practice and subscribed to the Insights Panel, rather than all members. However, (non)subscription to the Insights Panel is probably indicates (dis)inclination to respond to surveys from the RCR. There is also potential for responder bias, as those who feel strongly about artificial intelligence may be more likely to respond. The response rate was considered acceptable by the RCR and is in keeping with that of previous Insights Panel surveys. Furthermore, responses were from a wide range across the UK (and possibly beyond) and from both consultant and non-consultant grades, therefore capturing diverse views. Importantly, 14% of respondents were trainees, who are most likely to be impacted by the introduction of artificial intelligence during their careers. It is vital that training and educational materials incorporate the needs of this cohort. Conclusion In conclusion, this report highlights four important factors. First, artificial intelligence-based auto-contouring is in current clinical use and is expected to be adopted by more departments within the next year. Second, there currently exists no clear consensus on validation and quality assurance. Third, there is a marked appetite for urgent guidance, education and training on the safe use of such tools in clinical practice. Finally, there is a concern that the adoption and implementation of such tools is not equitable, which risks exacerbating existing inequalities across the country. Careful coordination is required to ensure that all radiotherapy departments, and the patients they serve, may enjoy the benefits of artificial intelligence in radiotherapy.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way human resources (HR) functions are carried out in the health sector of China. This study aims to scrutinize the impact of artificial intelligence on the human resource functions operating in the healthcare sector through technological awareness, social media influence, and personal innovativeness. Additionally, this study examines the moderating role of perceived risk between technological awareness and human resources functions. An online questionnaire was administered to human resources professionals in the health sector of China to gather data from 363 respondents. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a statistical procedure, is implemented to investigate the hypothesis of the projected model of artificial intelligence and human resource functions. The research findings reveal that artificial intelligence significantly influences human resource functions through technological awareness, social media influence, and personal innovativeness. Furthermore, perceived risk significantly moderates the relationship between technological awareness and human resource functions. The findings of this study have important implications for HR practitioners and policymakers in the health sectors of China, who can leverage artificial intelligence technologies to optimize and improve organizational performance. However, its adoption needs to be carefully planned and managed to reap the full benefits of this transformative technology. Keywords Artificial intelligence Technological awareness Personal innovativeness Perceived risk Social media influence Human resource functions 1 Introduction Artificial intelligence technologies have been the most illustrious factor across various industries around the globe due to their ability to automate routine tasks, improve decision-making and increase efficiency [1]. In today's digital world, artificial intelligence (AI) has been involved in diverse operations of the functional departments of healthcare institutions in China, which led to a revolution in business. Such practices are becoming increasingly significant in the healthcare sector of China by providing new innovative opportunities for efficiency, automation, and innovation to the human resource (HR) functions, including in the recruitment & selection process, training & development, and performance management [2]. Even recruiting a talented pool of candidates and managing multifariousness has become a terrific challenge for healthcare institutions in China. Consequently, implementing IA helps the healthcare sector automate miscellaneous aspects of talent acquisition, from screening resumes to onboarding qualified candidates to cope with such challenges [3]. A prior study [4] reported that artificial intelligence had become one of the top trends in the business world that influences the HR functions of diverse organizations in the expeditious talent acquisition process. Further, AI-powered virtual training assistants can provide personalized training to existing and new entrants based on their needs and learning styles. Such practices can help improve training programs' effectiveness and increase employee engagement [5]. A viable solution to improve HR operations in the Chinese hospital setting is artificial intelligence. The delivery of healthcare services and employee satisfaction can be improved by utilizing AI technologies in HR departments. However, conventional HR procedures may be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and occasionally ineffective in dealing with the healthcare industry's particular problems [6]. Information technology can help analyze employee performance data and identify patterns and trends. AI technology can assist in identifying potential performance issues and providing training and coaching to improve employee performance [7]. In a multifaceted and challenging hospital environment, technological awareness in healthcare institutions has significantly influenced HR management towards adopting sophisticated artificial intelligence that undertakes work activities previously carried out by humans [8]. China's healthcare sector is huge and developing quickly due to the country's large population and rising demand for high-quality medical care. The HR departments' responsibilities are recruiting, managing, and retaining healthcare experts and employees, which are essential to this industry [9]. However, technological awareness helps HR professionals to recruit and onboard competent candidates from different professional recruiting platforms such as Indeed and LinkedIn [10]. Quite a few studies signify that technological awareness opens the window of opportunity for HR managers to monitor the performance of the staff systematically and add their remarks regarding employees' performance electronically [11]. Furthermore, social media influences the top management of healthcare organizations to transform HR practices to improve the employee experience. In such a manner, social media can be a powerful tool for healthcare professionals looking to accept artificial intelligence to improve HR functions for long-term sustainability [12]. Because it made it convenient for employees to access valuable information and insights, create awareness and technical support, and, more specifically, connect HR professionals with employees and technical staff in the healthcare institutes [13]. A researcher [14] in the study reveals that personal innovativeness is a propensity to use new technological practices to improve HR functions. Recruit talented candidates who provide quality healthcare services to diverse patients and monitor their activities on digital platforms to reduce cost and time. Consequently, such practices motivate the management to develop new dynamic and innovative HR practices like innovative training & development programs that recover the overall performance of the HR functions in the healthcare industry [15]. However, with the proliferation of technological advancement in diverse industries, many research scholars have faced resistance from healthcare managers toward adopting such innovative practices due to the perceived risk associated with artificial intelligence and technological awareness [16]. In their study, a researcher [17] concluded the financial, social, performance, and privacy risks that negatively influence the behavior of top-level management of healthcare institutes toward implementing such technological practices to improve HR functions. Another study [18] highlighted that HR managers would be less likely to use artificial intelligence practices if they perceive the extensive risk involved, and their awareness, knowledge, and experience with particular technology may be restricted. However, health organizations worldwide have adopted technological tools and software to manage the functional departments professionally and systematically for long-term sustainability; therefore, few organizations are still in the adoption process [19]. The prior scholarships have identified the relationship between artificial intelligence, technological awareness, and its overall impact on HR functions in different sectors [4,20\u201322]. No one is used as a mediator, such as technological awareness, social media influence, and personal awareness, to implement artificial intelligence to improve the HR functions of the health sector. Therefore, a more extensive study is needed that comprehensively addresses the pros and cons of implementing IA in the healthcare industry and its impact on HR functions while mitigating the perceived risk through technological awareness. This novel study inspects the implementation of IA technology in the overall HR functions of healthcare institutes in China. Therefore, this study will help artificial intelligence developers, designers, and HR managers to understand artificial intelligence functions and develop strategies to manage errors and improve their functions. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to give the road to health sector organizations using IA technologies in their HR to improve progress. Second, this study uses technological awareness, social media influence, and personal awareness to attentive health sector employees as technological changes occur nowadays. Third, this study aims to implement IA and its effects on HR operations while optimizing perceived risk through technological competence. Moreover, this empirical research study is well-structured, with a literature review comprising the study's theoretical background, hypothesis derivation, and fundamental conceptual framework of artificial intelligence and HR functions. Eventually, it also demonstrates the research methodology that includes the study's research design and instruments, results, and data analysis. Further, this study also discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the study. However, this empirical study's conclusion, limitations, and future research direction have been portrayed at the end of this paper. 2 Literature review and supporting theories 2.1 Technology acceptance model The technology acceptance model (TAM) by Ref. [23] is an insightful and vigorous framework considering the technical frames influencing healthcare managers' behavior, adoption, and understanding of a particular technology. However, adopting new technology in healthcare institutes illustrates a decision-making process that demonstrates the factors for acceptance and resistance of HR managers towards technology [10]. However, TAM proposes that healthcare HR managers' intention to utilize a particular technology comprises their perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). That indicated crucial indicators of whether they would adopt new technology to improve HR functions such as talent acquisition process, performance management, training & development. However, perceived usefulness refers to the extent to which an individual believes using a particular technology will enhance performance. On the other hand, perceived ease of use refers to the extent to which an individual believes that the easier a technology is to use, the more likely people are to adopt it [23,24]. This can include factors like user interface design, training & support, and accessibility. However, the TAM framework has been extensively implemented the model in numerous explanatory studies [25,26] of technology implementation. In their study, a researcher [27] comprehensively probes the social media influence and cognitive as new factors to improve the specificity of the traditional TAM framework of investigating HR managers' intention towards the adaptability of a particular technology in healthcare institutes. Furthermore, diverse research scholars have demonstrated diverse TAM frameworks in their empirical research studies [12,28,29]. 2.2 Artificial intelligence and HR functions Artificial intelligence refers to the emergence of computer systems that can carry out operations that typically require human intelligence, such as recognition of speech, making decisions, and processing natural languages [18]. IA has the potential to reform many industries and improve our lives nowadays. However, there are concerns about artificial intelligence's moral and social implications, such as latent bias, judgment, job displacement, and loss of privacy [30]. In recent years, organizations have increasingly adopted AI-based solutions to enhance their HR functions. This trend is anticipated to continue because artificial intelligence has many advantages that can help businesses streamline their HR procedures and make better judgments [31]. The development of artificial intelligence demands rigorous consideration and regulation to guarantee that its advantages are maximized while its risks are minimized [4]. Organizations should ensure that their artificial intelligence solutions are based on various unbiased data sets and routinely audit their systems for potential bias to reduce these risks. As AI-powered solutions progress, they might be able to carry out specific HR activities faster and more precisely than humans, which would result in job losses [19]. To address this issue, Administrations should concentrate on retraining and upgrading workers to take on new tasks and responsibilities that sound for a human touch. Artificial intelligence technologies can help organizations improve their HR processes, increase efficiency, and make more informed decisions [14]. Corporations can enhance their hiring, training and development, and performance management procedures thanks to the growth of IA technologies. In the past, hiring managers would have to spend hours sorting through applications and resumes to find qualified individuals [32]. However, with the advent of AI-powered recruitment tools, recruiters can automate many tasks, including resume screening, candidate sourcing, and even initial interviews. AI-powered recruitment tools can also use machine learning algorithms to analyze data from job postings and candidate profiles, allowing recruiters to identify the most relevant candidates quickly [33]. These techniques can also evaluate candidates' communication abilities and personality qualities using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and help reduce recruitment bias by eliminating the need for human decision-making [34]. Past studies [35,36] highlighted that AI-powered learning tools supply healthcare professionals with the most recent knowledge and best practices to help them adjust their learning, enhance their performance, and improve the quality of care. Artificial intelligence is also being used to improve performance management, which can analyze data from various sources, including electronic health records, patient satisfaction surveys, and employee feedback [35]. Healthcare organizations offer insights into their staff members' performance, highlighting their strengths and growth opportunities. This evidence can then be used to develop targeted performance improvement plans for individual employees [36,37]. As technology continues to develop in the HR operations of the health industry, we can anticipate even more creative use of artificial intelligence. Based on the above discussion, we hypothesized. Hypothesis 1 Artificial intelligence has a positive relationship with HR functions. 2.3 Mediating role of technological awareness Artificial intelligence can automate tasks, analyze large amounts of data, and make predictions, leading to advancements in various fields. Making technology more useable and accessible is one-way artificial intelligence might raise awareness of technology [38]. Virtual assistants with AI capabilities can make it simpler and more effective for people to communicate with technology. As a result, one may become more accustomed to technology and comprehend its possibilities better [39]. AI can process vast volumes of data and find patterns that may be challenging for humans to notice using machine learning methods. This approach may result in new understandings and breakthroughs in engineering, finance, and healthcare [40]. Additionally, artificial intelligence can boost the productivity and security of several businesses, including manufacturing and transportation [41]. A past study highlighted the importance of the automobile sector as self-driving cars use artificial intelligence to navigate roads and avoid accidents. In contrast, manufacturing plants use artificial intelligence to optimize production processes and reduce waste [1]. Artificial intelligence can improve technological awareness by increasing accessibility to technology, boosting human comprehension of difficult topics, and raising the efficiency and safety of numerous businesses [17]. Artificial intelligence is the capacity of machines to mimic human intelligence and carry out operations like understanding, solving problems, and decision-making that traditionally demand human cognition. Technological awareness refers to the knowledge, skills, and understanding of technology and its applications [42]. Technological awareness has transformed the way healthcare is delivered. As a result, HR professionals must be aware of the latest technological advancements to recruit, train and retain the best employees [43]. HR professionals may find and attract competent applicants more effectively by using their technological awareness. It is possible to post job openings and reach a larger pool of people using social media platforms and online job boards. Furthermore, HR professionals can use applicant tracking systems to streamline recruitment and manage candidate applications more effectively [44]. Technology awareness can be leveraged to give healthcare workers opportunities for training and development. E-learning platforms, webinars, and virtual classrooms can deliver training content and ensure that employees are up-to-date with industry trends and best practices [8]. Technology can assist HR personnel in providing feedback and monitoring employee performance [18]. HR professionals aware of the latest technological advancements will be better equipped to meet the changing needs of the healthcare industry and attract and retain the best talent. However, the successful implementation and adoption of artificial intelligence in HR functions depend on the level of technological awareness of the individuals involved [45]. HR managers and employees lack the knowledge and skills to understand and use artificial intelligence, and the technology may not be effectively integrated into their workflows [43]. Therefore, technological awareness plays a mediating role in the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions in the healthcare sector of China. Hence, we hypothesized. Hypothesis 2 Technological awareness significantly mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions. 2.4 Mediating role of social media influence Personalization artificial intelligence algorithms can analyze user data such as search history, location, and behavior to personalize the content users see on their social media feeds. Social media helps users see more relevant and interesting content and increase engagement towards digital platforms [46]. Social media sites use artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to find and delete offensive or damaging information, such as hate speech or cyberbullying. Social media makes users' environments safer and more encouraging [5]. AI-powered chatbots are widely used on social media platforms to offer support and customer service. These bots can respond to frequently asked inquiries, make product suggestions, and provide users with individualized help [47]. Artificial intelligence algorithms can analyze user data to create targeted advertising campaigns, which helps ensure that users see ads relevant to their interests and needs, leading to increased engagement and better return on investment for advertisers [48]. A more positive and engaging atmosphere may be created for users thanks to artificial intelligence, which can also enhance the user experience on social media sites [49]. Healthcare organizations now have a strong tool for talent recruitment thanks to social media. Using websites like LinkedIn and Twitter, recruiters may connect with hiring managers and post career possibilities for job seekers. These platforms have improved recruitment in terms of rapidity, effectiveness, and cost [50]. Social media allows Healthcare workers easier access to training and development. Employees can access online training courses and webinars from any location, making it simpler to take advantage of professional development opportunities [7]. Additionally, social media can be used to monitor employee performance and provide criticism [51]. A manager can monitor staff social media activity to see who interacts with clients or spreads knowledge about the business. This data can be used in employee recognition and incentive programmers to thank employees for their contributions or to pinpoint areas that can benefit from additional training or support [13]. Healthcare organizations must also be aware of the integrity and authenticity of the material on social media sites. Social media may be a valuable tool for HR operations in the healthcare industry, but it must be handled carefully and properly [52]. The implementation of IA in HR functions of the health sector in China has been increasing in the modern age. Deep learning, managing natural language, and robotics are examples of IA technologies used in various HR practices, including hiring and selection, training, and performance management. Automating this procedure using artificial intelligence technologies will result in more accurate and effective evaluations of job candidates [53]. A past study highlighted [54] that social media can be used to promote employee engagement and training. Health sector employers in China can use social media platforms to share educational materials and to foster communication and collaboration among employees. Employers have leveraged social media to enhance their use of AI in HR functions, improving their ability to attract and retain top talent and enhancing the overall performance of their workforce [20]. Therefore, social media influence plays a significant role in mediating the relationship between IA and HR functions in the health sector of China. Hence, we hypothesized. Hypothesis 3 Social media influence significantly mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions. 2.5 Mediating role of personal innovativeness Personal innovativeness states an individual's willingness and capability to adopt and use new technologies or innovations. In the context of artificial intelligence in healthcare, personal innovativeness can influence how healthcare providers and organizations perceive and use technologies to improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare processes [20]. Increased willingness to learn and experiment with new technologies with personal innovators are more likely to seek out and explore new technologies, including artificial intelligence, and to experiment with their potential applications in healthcare. Consequently, it can lead to the significant adoption of artificial intelligence technologies [55]. Personal innovators intend to adopt change flexibly and are less likely to resist new technologies. Personal innovativeness can help to overcome potential barriers to artificial intelligence adoption, such as skepticism or resistance among healthcare providers [2]. Through innovativeness, individuals facilitate integrating IA knowledge into healthcare workflows and improve overall quality to improve healthcare processes and decision-making. Personal innovators could benefit from developing patient results, reducing healthcare costs, and improving complete care and treatment excellence [56]. Furthermore, a prior study [57] expressed personal innovativeness played a crucial role in driving the adoption of artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector and in realizing the potential benefits of these technologies for patients and healthcare organizations. Personal innovation can assist HR managers in luring and retaining creative and innovative teams that produce fresh concepts to enhance healthcare procedures. HR professionals can leverage personal innovation to find staff members who are willing to learn and experiment with new things [58]. These workers can then receive training and development to improve their imaginative and creative problem-solving skills. Personal innovativeness can be used as an indicator to assess an employee's capacity for developing fresh concepts and solutions [59]. HR managers can use this information to reward and recognize innovative employees and to motivate others to be more innovative. Personal ingenuity can assist HR managers in identifying and developing a staff better suited to address the difficulties of the healthcare sector and enhance healthcare results [60]. An individual's capacity and readiness to absorb and employ novel concepts and technology are measured by their level of personal innovation. Artificial intelligence has become a significant factor for HR functions in the health sector of China by automating routine tasks, such as data entry and analysis, and providing valuable insights into workforce management [61]. However, adopting artificial intelligence in HR practices requires a certain level of personal innovativeness from HR professionals. Innovative HR professionals with technical skills and knowledge are more willing to adopt artificial intelligence into HR functions effectively [62]. Highly innovative HR professionals are more likely to embrace artificial intelligence and effectively integrate it into their work, ultimately leading to improved HR functions and better healthcare outcomes. Hence, we hypothesized. Hypothesis 4 Personal innovativeness mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions. 2.6 Moderating role of perceived risk Technological awareness refers to an individual's knowledge, understanding, and familiarity with technology. Similarly, perceived risk states an individual's awareness of the possible positive consequences of using a particular technology [63]. Concerns about privacy and security may lead individuals to hesitate to use certain online services or share personal information online, limiting their technological awareness [4]. Conversely, when individuals perceive a high risk-taking ability with technology, they may be more likely to be involved and develop a greater awareness and familiarity with it [64]. The perceived risk of using smartphones and social media has led to widespread adoption and high levels of technological awareness in those areas [65]. Perceived risk can be an important factor in shaping individuals' attitudes and behaviors toward technology and influencing their level of technological awareness. HR functions involve managing employees and their relationships with the organization, such as the talent acquisition process, training and development, performance management, and employee relations [21]. Individuals have a high level of technological consciousness and perceive the risks associated with using technology to be low. They may be more likely to adopt and fully utilize technology in their HR functions [19]. Risk-taking abilities of individuals could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HR practices, leading to better outcomes for the health sector. Perceived risk can effect an organization's ability to attract top talent. Potential candidates take risks using technology and uplift their industry [10]. Perceived risk can also impact the effectiveness of training and development programs [66]. Employees with a high perceived risk of speaking up about concerns or giving feedback may be less likely to do so. Perceived risk is also a personality element that can increase transparency and address performance issues [67]. Perceived risk impacts the organizations must prioritize creating a culture of trust, transparency, and clear communication with employees [68]. Technological awareness refers to the knowledge, understanding, and familiarity individuals or organizations have with new technologies. In the context of the health sector, this could include knowledge of electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, or other digital health tools [25]. In the healthcare sector, this could include practices related to recruitment, training, performance management, and employee engagement [69]. Perceived risk is the subjective evaluation of the potential positive consequences of adopting new technologies. This process includes concerns about data privacy, security, or the potential for errors or failures in the technology itself [70]. Furthermore, the authors [37] highlighted the complex interplay between technology, risk, and HR functions in the healthcare sector. Healthcare organizations must carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards of successfully adopting new technology in the health sector. They also need to build creative methods [71]. This study provides a procedure to mitigate perceived risks while maximizing the potential benefits of new technologies. Hence, we hypothesized. Hypothesis 5 Perceived risk significantly moderates the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions. 2.7 Research questions and conceptual framework The current study explains three research questions: first, does artificial intelligence link with HR functions of the health sector of China? Second, do technological awareness, social media influence, and personal awareness mediate the relationship between artificial intelligence link with HR functions? Third, does perceived risk moderate the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions? Furthermore, Fig. 1 below presents a conceptual framework after an in-depth literature review, as already mentioned above, to explain the model exhibited below. 3 Research methodology This section extensively explains the research methods, survey instruments, data collection and sampling, demographic details, and procedure for conducting this empirical study. Foremost, we employed a quantitative research technique via an online survey method to gather the data for empirical analysis for this research study [72]. In today's digital world, gathering data from online channels is much faster, more efficient, and cheaper than the traditional dissemination of the manual questionnaire. Therefore, the best course of action is to acquire information through an online poll to get the respondents' responses. However, a convenience sampling technique is implemented for this cross-sectional preliminary research study to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence through technological awareness, social media influence, personal innovativeness, and perceived risk on the HR functions of healthcare organizations in China. The quantitative method involves in this study discussing robustness, efficiency, ability to handle specific data types, and how it aligns with the research objectives. The fact that this strategy is suited for the study's sample size and data quality supports the claim that it is preferable. A deeper examination can be produced using SEM, a comprehensive statistical technique that enables you to evaluate and validate complicated correlations in your conceptual model. Choosing the most appropriate quantitative method is essential based on our research objectives, our conceptual model's complexity, and the target population's characteristics. Additionally, consider pre-testing your questionnaire to ensure clarity and reliability before deploying it on a larger scale. In quantitative research, researchers [21,22,73] demonstrate that firstly, research scholars must design the research instruments before data collection. 3.1 Data collection and sampling Convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling method where researchers select the most readily available individuals or subjects. This study used convenience sampling to generate hypotheses or get initial insights. Secondly, this method allows researchers to collect data efficiently, which can be beneficial when time constraints are a significant consideration. Data is collected from human resource managers, operational managers, quality assurance managers, and other healthcare staff of government and non-government hospitals in China. Before gathering survey data, a cover letter was given to the hospital directors outlining the purpose, reassuring the confidentiality of respondents\u2019 information that the data would only be used for research purposes, and seeking permission for data collection from the respondents. 3.2 Survey instrument development Initially, we developed a questionnaire for the purpose of data gathering. However, a 5-point Likert scale is used to grade 31 items of respective constructs in the questionnaire, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). However, the questionnaire consists of two major sections. The first section includes demographic details, including age, gender, designation, and occupational experience. Respectively, the subsequent division is embedded with questions regarding artificial intelligence, social media influence, technological awareness, personal awareness, perceived risk, and human resource functions. This explanatory study includes six artificial intelligence items, as recommended by Ref. [74], to investigate their impact on the HR functions of healthcare institutes. Likewise, the study [47] suggested five items of social media influence to investigate the participants' response towards implementing particular technology through social media platforms to improve HR functions. However, the measurement scale of technological awareness is adopted from Ref. [10] with five items to demonstrate its influence on HR managers towards technology implementation. Further, five items of personal innovativeness are measured on a five-point Likert scale as endorsed by Ref. [75] to examine healthcare professionals' responses. Furthermore, five perceived risk items are being measured on a five-point Likert scale to investigate, manage and mitigate the degree of risk associated with implementing a particulate technology [76]. Finally, five items of human resources function are utilized from a research study conducted by Ref. [8] on a five-point Likert scale. All details of items are attached in Appendix A. 3.3 Respondent's summary A convenience sample is considered to investigate the projected model of artificial intelligence and HR functions. However, the respondents of the present research study are HR managers, operation managers, quality assurance managers, and other healthcare staff of all functional departments of each government and a non-government medical institute in Beijing, China. The questionnaire survey is conducted, 400 questionnaires are sent out to the participants online, and 363 questionnaires are obtained with complete information from respondents. 37 responses were received with missing values. So, finally, we used n = 363 for analysis purposes. The response rate of the questionnaire survey is 90 %. However, in this empirical analysis, we employed descriptive statistics. Although the survey data comprises 211 males (58 %) and 152 females (42 %), respondents demonstrate the ratio of participants between males and females who are influenced by artificial intelligence towards implementing a particular technology in HR. Therefore, a total sample of 363 healthcare service providers aged 20c44 is selected to participate in the present study for an empirical investigation. Although the ratio of respondents in terms of work experience with 1\u20135 years of experience is 38 %, with 6\u201310 years of experience is 44 %, and with 11\u201315 years of experience is 18 %. Likewise, HR managers 30 %, operation managers 30 %, quality assurance managers 33 %, and other healthcare staff 7 % are the ratio of respondents from whom we collected the data for conducting empirical analysis. Moreover, see Table 1 , which reasonably outlines the respondent's demographic representation. 3.4 Common method and non-response bias Research conclusions that rely on the survey data collection method may be influenced by common method bias [77]. Therefore, in this study, we employed several techniques to lessen the impact of common method bias. Since we only utilized one survey method to get the data, typical method bias can affect how reliable the study conclusions are. We employed anonymous respondents, well-designed questionnaires, and statements that accurately reflected both the questionnaires' positive and negative aspects, as the researcher recommended [77]. The total variation explained is less than 50 % according to data obtained using Harman's test using a single factor in factor analysis. This demonstrates that our study is free from common method bias. Non-response is a challenge in survey research and impacts the findings. In this study, we examine early responders and late respondents divided at a ratio of 70:30 [78] on categorical variables (academic majors, place, and gender) in order to assess non-response bias. We use the t-test to compare the values of the variables in the early stage of the research and the late stage of the research to determine if non-response impacts the research outcomes. There was no difference between the two groups, according to the results (p-value >0.05). These test findings suggested that our research raised no questions about response bias. 4 Results Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is applied in the current study to evaluate the projected structure of AI and HR functions with Smart PLS 3.3 statistical software [79]. PLS-SEM has recently adopted a statistical method [80] to estimate the dysfunctional relationships among observed and latent variables [81]. PLS-SEM is principally suitable for the present study to operate [22,81\u201384] diverse structure of mediation and moderation [85]. PLS-SEM amalgamates a two-step modeling procedure to determine the measurement and structure framework [86]. 4.1 Measurement model evaluation The measurement model of this study is validated by using the PLS-SEM approach. In the measurement model, confirmatory factor analysis CFA is executed on variables to validate the convergent validity [87]. The structure model validates such as internal consistency, discriminant validity, and goodness of fit in estimating [85]. Foremost, indicator reliability is inspected for validity. Likewise, Table 2 comprehensively exhibits the reliability values of each indicator that are greater than the minimum acceptable level of 0.4 or the estimated level of 0.7 [88]. Since prehistoric times, Cronbach's alpha has been used to evaluate internal consistent reliability [89]. Specifically, the items of the respective constructs are intended as valid items because the values of Cronbach's alpha are higher than the slightest satisfactory level of 0.7. Cronbach's alpha, values of artificial intelligence = 0.941, human resource functions = 0.873, perceived risk = 0.861, personal innovativeness = 0.953, social media influence = 0.935, technological awareness = 0.938. Even so, composite reliability is extensively applied for evaluation following the suggestion by Ref. [82]. All values of Cronbach's alpha are placed within the range in Table 2. The composite reliability in Table 2 comprehensively demonstrates the satisfactory values that disclose the extreme internal consistency reliability of \u22650.7 [73]. Composite reliability values of artificial intelligence = 0.953, human resource function = 0.907, perceived risk = 0.898, personal innovativeness = 0.964, social media influence = 0.951, technological awareness = 0.953. All values of Cronbach's alpha are positioned within the range in Table 2. Correspondingly, the average variance extracted prohibits the construct's convergent validity. Convergent validity is a common subject in the outer loading of each variable, and it is also measured from the average variance extracted (AVE) from each variable [90]. Nevertheless, from Table 2, the values of AVE are higher than the minimum acceptance value of 0.5 [91]. AVE values of artificial intelligence = 0.772, human resource function = 0.665, perceived risk = 0.641, personal innovativeness = 0.843, social media influence = 0.793, technological awareness = 0.803. All values of AVE are positioned within the range in Table 2. Consequently, the variance inflation factors VIF are employed for scrutinizing the multicollinearity [73]. A researcher [92] in a research study concludes that multicollinearity only appears when the values of VIF are higher than 5, which is high enough. Conversely, the consequences of the present research study demonstrate the value of VIF, as verified in Table 2, which is lower than 5 and forbids the scarcity of multicollinearity [88]. However, the PLS-SEM algorithm specifically measures the validity of the constructs. The discriminant validity ensures that every variable is distinct from the other variables [93]. Hence, the discriminant validity is evaluated by each latent variable's square root average variance extracted (AVE), which must be higher than the latent variable correlations. More specifically, Table 3 comprehensively exposes the present research findings that the model has satisfied the discriminant value. Second, the discriminant validity has been tested using the HTMT ratio and other cutting-edge methods. The information indicates that the HTMT ratio is below 0.85 [94]. Table 4 demonstrates very good discriminant validity. 4.2 Structural model evaluation The structure model uses a bootstrapping technique with 5000 resamples used to obtain population mean (\u03bc), standard deviation (STDEV), \u03b2 e t a -values, t-test values, and p-test values to authenticate statistical significance [95]. The R2 analysis estimates the coefficient of determination using the product of the dependent variable's variance ratio and the independent construct's total variance [96]. Values of R2 reflect how well the IVs are able to describe the DVs. Correspondingly, the values of R2 of human resource functions = 0.387, technological awareness = 0.247, social media awareness = 0.090, and personal innovativeness = 0.246. Furthermore, the difference between the examined interrelationship and the model indirect interrelationship matrix is known as the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Values less than 0.10 or 0.08 indicate a good fit in SRMR. The structural model is created using SmartPLS, and model fitness is examined. The model is usually well-fitting, according to the results of the fitness indices. As an illustration, the following values are given: SRMR = 0.0913, Chi-square = 6505.884, and NFI = 0.573. Fig. 2 represents the graphical representation of the structure model of artificial intelligence and HRF. Furthermore, Table 5 points out the -values, p-test values, and path coefficients as generated by structure equation modeling (SEM) for hypothesis testing. Consequently, the present study further highlighted that artificial intelligence in the medical sector has an affirmative influence over improved HR functions with the values ( \u03b2 = 0.145 , t = 2.601 , p < 0.05 ) . So, this study's findings have supported H1. The study outcomes align with the literature on the relationship between artificial intelligence and Chinese health sector HR functions [2,97]. Similarly, artificial intelligence and technological awareness show a significant relationship with values ( \u03b2 = 0.497 , t = 12.095 , p < 0.05 ) . Technological awareness is positively related to HR functions with values ( \u03b2 = 0.236 , t = 4.216 , p < 0.05 ) . Further, artificial intelligence and social media influence have a significant relationship with the values ( \u03b2 = 0.300 , t = 6.253 , p < 0.05 ) . Social media influence is positively related to HR functions with values ( \u03b2 = 0.223 , t = 4.266 , p < 0.05 ) . Subsequently, a significant correlation exists between artificial intelligence and personal innovativeness with values ( \u03b2 = 0.496 , t = 13.611 , p < 0.05 ) . Personal innovativeness is positively related to HR functions with values ( \u03b2 = 0.142 , t = 2.761 , p < 0.05 ) . More specifically, the significant mediation role of technological awareness, social media influence, and personal innovativeness between artificial intelligence and HR functions in the healthcare industry is shown in Table 5. Firstly, technological awareness significantly mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions with values ( \u03b2 = 0.118 , t = 3.984 , p < 0.05 ) . The findings of this study supported H2. The study outcomes align with the literature on the relationship between technological awareness mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions [43,44]. Secondly, social media influence significantly mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions with values ( \u03b2 = 0.067 , t = 3.632 , p < 0.05 ) . The results of this study supported H3. The study outcomes align with the literature on the relationship between social media influence mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions [52,98]. Thirdly, personal innovativeness significantly mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions with values ( \u03b2 = 0.071 , t = 2.730 , p < 0.05 ) . The findings of this study supported H4. The study outcomes align with the literature on the relationship between personal innovativeness mediates the relationship between artificial intelligence and HR functions [20,57]. Additionally, perceived risk has a pessimistic alliance with HR functions ( \u03b2 = 0.103 , t = 2.012 , p < 0.05 ) . The moderating role of perceived risk significantly moderates the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions with values ( \u03b2 = 0.111 , t = 2.147 , p < 0.05 ) . The study outcomes align with the literature on the relationship between perceived risk moderates the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions [4,37]. The results of this study supported H5. Thus, all hypotheses are accepted. 4.3 Moderating graph Perceived risk as a moderating variable transforms the effectiveness and the path of the relationship of the independent and dependent variables in the structure model. Therefore, to test and scrutinize the impact of the moderation variable on the independent variable, mediating variable, and dependent variable by implementing the product indicator technique. However, Table 5 shows a moderation effect of perceived risk ( \u03b2 = 0.111 , t = 2.147 , p < 0.05 ) to predict the appropriate level of technological awareness among HR professionals toward artificial intelligence implementations, which ultimately predicts the HR functions of healthcare managers. The moderation effect of perceived risk is delineated in Fig. 3 at the two diverse respective levels. According to the slope, the higher the perceived risk, the higher the technological awareness, ultimately leading to improved and efficient HR functions. Conversely, the lower the slope of perceived risk, the lower the technological awareness among HR professionals. However, the higher perceived risk associated with higher technological awareness of the influence of artificial intelligence implementation on HR functions is strong. Therefore, low perceived risk leads to low technological awareness and weakens its impact on HR functions. Moreover, Table 5 comprehensively illustrates the moderation effect of perceived risk in forecasting technological awareness and HR functions. For a clear understanding, see Fig. 3, which represents the analytical representation of the moderation effect on the proposed model of artificial intelligence and HR functions. 5 Discussion and key findings In the twenty-first century, the internet has evolved into a practical information-sharing platform, and the development of artificial intelligence has revolutionized traditional systems in various industries. AI has the probability of revolutionizing HR functions by systematizing repetitive tasks and providing data-driven perceptions with the help of AI health sector policymakers, enhancing abilities and leading to more effective HR strategies. The primary objective of conducting this research is to inspect the impact of artificial intelligence on HR duties like the hiring and selection process, training and development, and performance management in the health sector of China. This study also inspects the mediating role of technological awareness, social media influence, and personal innovativeness. Additionally, it inspects the moderating role of perceived risk between technological awareness and HR functions. Data was gathered from 363 employees who are working in hospitals in different positions. The questionnaires were given to the targeted sample for their opinion about artificial intelligence use in HR functions. The results are deliberated in five major portions: first, the findings indicate that artificial intelligence substantially influences HR functions. Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing HR processes by advancing hiring and talent acquisition, boosting employee experience and improving employee engagement, enabling decision-making, facilitating employee development and upskilling, and automating HR operations [99]. A previous study [100] showed that adopting IA can streamline HR processes, optimize workforce management, and improve organizational performance, supporting our findings. Another past study [100] findings supported our study arguments as AI algorithms that analyze employee skill sets and career aspirations to recommend relevant learning opportunities to meet changing business demands. Second, the current study investigated the mediating constructs of technological awareness between artificial intelligence and HR functions. The outcomes of this study show that the association between artificial intelligence and HR functions is significantly mediated by technological awareness, which is confirmed by the prior literature [41]. A past study [101] also highlighted that technological awareness referred to HR professionals understanding how artificial intelligence works, the data it uses, and how it can be integrated into existing HR processes. It can also help them identify potential ethical concerns and ensure that artificial intelligence is used fairly and unbiasedly. Through the help of technological awareness, HR professionals communicate more effectively with IT professionals and vendors responsible for implementing and maintaining artificial intelligence systems [40]. Similarly, a prior study supported our arguments as they evaluated and selected artificial intelligence solutions to align with their HR objectives, implement them, and train HR staff to utilize the technology effectively [102]. Third, the current research inspected the mediating role of social media influence between artificial intelligence and HR functions. The study findings illustrate that the affiliation between artificial intelligence and HR functions is significantly mediated by social media influence established by the prior literature [52]. A prior study highlighted that with the help of AI, HR departments analyzed social media data to identify latent job candidates and assess their fit with the organization [53]. Another study [103] backed our arguments as AI-powered sentiment analysis tools monitored employee sentiment on social media platforms, providing HR insights into employee morale and job satisfaction. A past study [53] focused on artificial intelligence to help HR professionals monitor social media channels, analyze feedback, and respond to real-time comments and reviews company's brand image. By combining the power of artificial intelligence with social media, HR can create a more efficient, effective, and engaging workplace. Fourth, the present study investigated the mediating role of personal innovativeness between artificial intelligence and HR functions. The research outcomes express that the connection between artificial intelligence and HR operations is significantly mediated by personal innovativeness, confirmed by the prior literature [62]. Personal innovativeness refers to enthusiasm by an entity and the ability to implement novel concepts, technologies, and processes. Regarding HR operations, personal innovativeness can influence the degree to which personalities are willing to accept and use AI in the workplace [104]. Individuals who are more innovative and open to new ideas will likely embrace artificial intelligence in HR operations because they get potential benefits. Therefore, organizations looking to implement AI technology in their HR operations should consider their employees' level of personal innovativeness and provide training and support to help individuals become more innovative and adaptable [105]. Fifth, this study considered the moderating role of perceived risk between technological awareness and HR functions. The results show that the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions is significantly moderated by perceived risk, which is established by the prior literature [4]. A past study [70] highlighted how perceived risk influenced HR professionals using technology for recruitment. They are more engaged in adopting new technological solutions with high technological awareness. Another study [37] focused on perceived risks associated with technology adoption by controlling negative impacts such as data breaches, loss of human touch in employee interactions, and potential job losses due to automation. HR professionals with high awareness and risk-taking abilities are ready to adopt artificial intelligence [48]. This study's results show that strong evidence supports a higher perceived risk linked to greater technological awareness of the impact of artificial intelligence implementation on HR operations, from results and graphical representation in Table 5 and Fig. 3 that clearly depict that high risk associated with higher technology awareness which ultimately improves the execution of actions. 5.1 Theoretical implications Artificial Intelligence has turned out to be a buzzword in today's digital world. However, the adoption of artificial intelligence has become widespread in various sectors. One major sector that has adopted artificial intelligence is the healthcare industry. Artificial intelligence has been applied to various HR practices, including talent acquisition process, training and development, and performance management, which have positively influenced the HR functions in the healthcare sector. This study has some theoretical implications. The study provides insights into the key factors that can facilitate or hinder the adoption and implementation of HR technology in the health sector of China. Firstly, this research adds value to the existing pool of literature in numerous manners. This empirical study provides research indications of the positive influence of IA on HR functions in the healthcare sector of China. Second, the study highlights the role of technological awareness, social media influence, and personal innovativeness in facilitating the adoption of IA in HR functions. Third, specifically, the study highlights the moderating role of perceived risk between technological awareness and HR functions. This finding suggests that organizations should pay attention to the perceived risks associated with HR technology adoption and implementation to increase the chances of successful adoption and implementation. The findings of this study are reliable with the TAM model that posits that perceived usefulness and ease of use influence the intent to utilize innovation that ultimately influences behaviors towards the actual use of technology. The study extends the TAM by incorporating perceived risk as a moderator between technological awareness and HR functions. 5.2 Practical implications This study also has some practical implications. The current research has several practical implications for HR managers in the healthcare sector of China. First, the study suggests that HR managers should know how artificial intelligence might improve HR processes, including performance management, training and development, and recruiting employees. Second, HR professionals should use social media to involve staff in adopting artificial intelligence and raise awareness of its advantages. Third, HR managers should encourage personal innovativeness among employees by providing training and development opportunities. Fourth, HR managers could address the perceived dangers of implementing IA by clearly outlining the advantages and hazards, ensuring data security, and fostering an environment of openness and trust. The study also highlights how technological awareness, social media influence, and personal innovativeness contribute to the literature on HR technology adoption and implementation. This finding suggests that to maximize the likelihood of effective adoption and execution, organizations should pay attention to the perceived risks associated with HR technology adoption and implementation. HR managers in the healthcare sector of China should be aware of these factors and take appropriate measures to leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence in HR functions. 6 Conclusion 6.1 Policy implications In recent years, the health sector of China has shown a rising interest in adopting artificial intelligence in various aspects of their operations, including HR procedures, just as the hiring and selection process, training and development, and performance management. This empirical research intended to investigate the influence of IA implementation on HR responsibilities like talent acquisition process, training and development, and performance management in the health sector of China through technological awareness, social media influence, and personal innovativeness. Additionally, it inspects the moderating role of perceived risk between technological awareness and HR functions. The research study has a five-fold contribution; at first, AI significantly influences HR functions in the health sector of China. Second, technological awareness significantly mediates the association between IA and HR functions. Third, social media influence significantly mediates the connection between IA and HR functions. Fourth, personal innovativeness significantly mediates the relationship between IA and HR functions. Fifth, perceived risk significantly moderates the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions. The research findings of this empirical research study indicate that artificial intelligence has a substantial potential to expand the proficiency and usefulness of HR functions in the health sector of China. However, organizations need to manage perceived risks associated with artificial intelligence adoption to maximize the benefits in their organizations. Moreover, social media influence and personal innovativeness are critical in determining the level of artificial intelligence adoption in HR functions. Healthcare organizations must foster collaboration between HR professionals and technology experts to ensure the effective adoption and utilization of artificial intelligence in HR functions. 6.2 Limitations and future directions The current study comprises numerous research limitations that should be addressed in future research. Foremost, the present research focuses on the health sector of China, limiting its generalizability to other countries and sectors. Future research should also compare the findings across different countries to identify cultural and contextual factors that may impact the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions. Secondly, the limited sample size of this study may not represent the entire population of the health sector in China. Future research should use longitudinal designs or mixed methods to track changes over time and establish causality between technological awareness and HR functions. Thirdly, this cross-sectional empirical study limits the capability to inaugurate causality and track changes over time. Fourthly, the study does not control the other factors that may impact the relationship between technological awareness and HR functions, organizational culture, leadership, and employee attitudes. Future research should look for such competitive constructs that strongly impact technological awareness and HR functions, including organizational culture, leadership, and employee attitudes. Fifth, in this study, we collected data only from Beijing hospitals due to a shortage of time. For future researchers, they will consider different cities or draw comparisons. Lastly, in this study, risk acts as a moderator as people are more aware they are taking high risks and using new technology. For future perspective, researchers will use training and development of employees as important factors with awareness to use artificial intelligence.

Once conformity has been verified, sandboxes can be used to interface with the deployed AI-based asset via the established monitoring plan, so that information about its post-market functioning can be collected and processed. This information is used by the national supervisory authority to evaluate the compliance: if needed, the authority asks for corrective actions and/or reports serious incidents/a continued lack of compliance to the European Commission.

Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on seven technical requirements sustained over three main pillars that should be met throughout the system\u2019s entire life cycle: it should be (1) lawful, (2) ethical, and (3) robust, both from a technical and a social perspective. However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the system\u2019s life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in this matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among these views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial for the present and future of our society.

Despite its important historical development, in the last years AI has vigorously entered all professional and social domains of applications, from automation to healthcare, education and beyond. Recently, a family of generative AI (DALL-E 2 2 DALL-E, https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2, accessed on April 25th, 2023. [1], Imagen 3 3 Google Imagen, https://imagen.research.google/, accessed on April 25th, 2023. [2] or large language model products such as ChatGPT 4 4 Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (Chat GPT), https://chat.openai.com/chat, accessed on April 25th, 2023. ) have sparked a significant amount of debates. These arise as a concern on what this could mean in all fields of application and what impact they could have. These debates, active for years now, pose questions regarding the ethical aspects and requirements that AI systems must comply with. They emerge from the ethical principles\u2019 perspective, from the regulation ones, from what it means to have fair AI, or from the technological point of view, on what an ethical development and use of AI systems really mean. The notion of trustworthy AI has attracted particular interest across the political institutions of the European Union (EU). The EU has intensively worked on elaborating this concept through a set of guidelines based on ethical principles and requirements for trustworthy AI [3]. Trustworthy AI is a holistic and systemic approach that acts as prerequisite for people and societies to develop, deploy and use AI systems [3]. It is composed of three pillars and seven requirements: the legal, ethical, and technical robustness pillars; and the following requirements: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability. Although the previous definition is based on requirements, there is a larger multidimensional vision. It considers the ethical debate per se, the ethical principles and a risk-based approach to regulation, backed up by the EU AI Act [4]. The goal of this paper is to become a primer for researchers and practitioners interested in a holistic vision of trustworthy AI from 4 axes (Fig. 1): from ethical principles and AI ethics, to legislation and technical requirements. According to this vision, our analysis tackles the main aspects of trustworthy AI in a non-exhaustive but technical fashion, by: \u2022 Providing a holistic vision of the multifaceted notion of trustworthy AI that considers its diverse principles for ethical use and development of AI, seen from international agencies, governments and the industry. \u2022 Breaking down this multidimensional vision of trustworthy AI into 4 axes, to reveal the intricacies associated to its pillars, its technical and legal requirements, and what responsibility in this context really means. \u2022 Examining requirements for trustworthy AI, addressing what each requirement actually means, why it is necessary and proposed, and how it is being addressed technologically. While this paper is not intended to be an exhaustive review, we will delve into an overview of technical possibilities to address the aforementioned seven key requirements for trustworthy AI. \u2022 Analyzing AI regulation from a pragmatic perspective to understand the essentials of the most advanced legal piece existing so far, the European Commission perspective, and to fully grasp its practical applicability. \u2022 Defining responsible AI systems as the result of connecting the many-sided aspects of trustworthy AI above. This is the notion we advocate for, in order to truly attain trustworthy AI. Their design should be guided by regulatory sandboxes. \u2022 Dissecting currently hot debates on the status of AI, the moratorium letter to pause giant AI experiments, the current movements around an international regulation and our positioning based on the previous analyses. By bridging the gap from theory (AI Principles, Ethics, and Key Requirements) to practice (Responsible AI Systems and Regulation), our holistic view offered in this work aims to ultimately highlight the importance of all these elements in the development and integration of human-centered AI-based systems into the everyday life of humans, in a natural and sustainable way. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 revises the most widely recognized AI principles for the ethical use and development of AI (axis 1). Section 3 considers axis 2: a philosophical approach to AI ethics. Section 4 (axis 3) presents the current risk-based viewpoint to AI regulation. Section 5 analyzes axis 4, i.e., key requirements to implement trustworthy AI from a technical point of view. Section 6 discusses the practical applicability of trustworthy AI by first closing the loop through the necessary definition of responsible AI systems, and then exposing the requirements for high-risk AI systems to comply with the law. It also proposes the use of regulatory sandboxes as a challenge to test the former requirements via auditing, and a practical blueprint as a case study for AI healthcare. We end this section by elaborating on the needs of emerging AI systems (including general purpose AI and neuroscience technology), which demand evolved evaluation protocols and dynamic regulation. Section 7 follows by dissecting currently hot debates on the status of AI, from the AI moratorium letter to regulation as the key for consensus, including a reflection on the gap to be closed between regulation and technological progress. Finally, Section 8 draws concluding remarks, and highlights the aforementioned convergence between AI technology and regulation as the beacon for research efforts that safely bring the benefits of this technology to humanity. 2 Principles for ethical use and development of Artificial Intelligence A large set of declarations and guidelines for the ethical use and development of AI has bloomed. These declarations lead to different similar approaches for introducing sets of principles as a departure point for discussing about the responsible development of AI. In this section we will analyze three different principle declarations. We will start in Section 2.1 with the general UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and continue in Section 2.2 taking a practical perspective from the industry point of view through the principles of Responsible AI by Design in Practice by Telef\u00f3nica, a global telecommunication and media company with large presence in the Spanish and Portuguese markets. Finally, in Section 2.3 we analyze the ethical principles based on fundamental rights associated to the European approach. 2.1 UNESCO recommendation on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence In November 2021, UNESCO proposed in Paris a Recommendation on the Ethics of AI. Recognizing that AI can be of great service to humanity and all countries can benefit from it, but also can raise fundamental ethical concerns (can deepen existing divides and inequities in the world), and accounting for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the rest of relevant international recommendations and declarations, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, [5] are the following: 1. Proportionality and do no harm: AI methods should not infringe upon the foundational values in these recommendations, should be based on rigorous scientific foundations, and final human determination should apply. 2. Safety and security: Unwanted harms such as safety risks, and vulnerabilities to attacks (security risks) should be avoided and addressed throughout the life cycle of AI systems. 3. Fairness and non-discrimination: AI actors should promote social justice and safeguard fairness. Member States should tackle digital divides ensuring inclusive access and equity, and participation in the development of AI. 4. Sustainability: The continuous assessment of the human, social, cultural, economic and environmental impact of AI technology should be carried out with \u201cfull cognizance of the implications of AI for sustainability\u201d as a set of constantly evolving goals. 5. Right to Privacy, and Data Protection: Privacy must be respected, protected and promoted throughout the AI life cycle. 6. Human oversight and determination: Member States should ensure that it is always possible to attribute ethical and legal responsibility for any stage of the life cycle of AI systems, as well as in cases of remedy related to AI systems, to physical persons or existing legal entities. 7. Transparency and explainability: Transparency is necessary for relevant liability regimes to work effectively. AI actors should commit to ensuring that the algorithms developed are explainable, especially in cases that impact the end user in a way that is not temporary, easily reversible or otherwise low risk. 8. Responsibility and accountability: \u201cThe ethical responsibility and liability for the decisions and auctions based in any way on an AI system should always ultimately be attributable to AI actors\u201d 9. Awareness and literacy: Public awareness and understanding of AI technologies and the value of data should be promoted through open and accessible education, civic engagement, digital skills and AI ethics training. All society should be able to take informed decisions about their use of AI systems and be protected from undue influence. 10. Multi-stakeholder and adaptive governance and collaboration: \u201cParticipation of different stakeholders throughout the AI system life cycle is necessary for inclusive approaches to AI governance, enabling the benefit to be shared by all, and to contribute to sustainable development\u201d. The proposed principles are accompanied by values to promote, e.g., human rights and fundamental freedoms. Values and principles are designed to be respected by all actors involved in the AI system life cycle, being amenable of change through amendments to existing and new legislation and business guidelines, since they must comply with international law, the United Nations Charter and Member States. 2.2 Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s principles of responsible AI by design in practice Enterprises also need to cope with and adapt to new demands of AI products and associated risks. The previous recommendations are also aligned with the more generic principles for AI defined by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University that started being developed since 2016: Principled AI maps ethical and rights-based approaches to principles for AI to address issues related to the potential threats of AI to both individuals and society as a whole. Derived from these, in industry, e.g., Telef\u00f3nica defines the so-called 5 principles of Responsible AI by Design in Practice [6] as: 1. Fair AI: the output of AI systems must not lead to discrimination. 2. Transparent and explainable AI: people should know whether they are communicating with a person or an AI-based system. 3. Human-centered AI (AI for Social Good, Human-centered AI [7]): AI products and services must be aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 4. Privacy and security by design: standards should be considered during all life cycles, also from the Responsible Research and Innovation Guidelines [8]. 5. Extend them to any third party. The adoption of these and similar principles is part of new awareness strategies being carried out in companies, sometimes known as change management. Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s approach is only one example of such adoption. This implies a change in organizations culture to take into account and implement these principles on a day-to-day basis. 2.3 Ethical principles based on fundamental rights In Europe, the foundations of trustworthy AI adhere to the four ethical principles proposed by the European Commission\u2019s High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) [3]. These are based on fundamental rights, to which AI practitioners should always strive to adhere, in order to ensure the development, deployment and use of AI systems in a trustworthy way. Trustworthy AI is grounded in fundamental rights and reflected by the European Commission\u2019s Ethical Principles: 1. Respect for human autonomy: Ensure freedom and autonomy of humans interacting with AI systems implies humans should keep full and effective self-determination over themselves and the ability to take part on democratic processes; AI systems should not \u201cunjustifiably subordinate, coerce, deceive, manipulate, condition or herd humans, but rather, argument, complement and empower human cognitive, social and cultural skills, leave opportunity for human choice and securing human oversight over work processes\u201d in AI systems, e.g., support humans in the work environment and support the creation of meaningful work. 2. Prevention of harm 5 5 Harm can be individual or collective, can include intangible harm to social, cultural, political or natural environments and all living beings. : AI systems should not \u201ccause nor exacerbate harm or adversely affect humans\u201d. AI systems should \u201cprotect human dignity, mental and physical integrity, be technically robust and assure they are not open to malicious use\u201d. For instance, they should be supervised so they do not exacerbate adverse impacts due to information asymmetries or unequal balance of power. 3. Fairness: Fairness is closely related to the rights to Non-discrimination, Solidarity and Justice. Although there are many different interpretations of fairness, the European Commission advocates for having both: (a) a substantive dimension of fairness that \u201ccommits to ensure equal and just distribution of benefits and costs, commits to free from unfair bias, discrimination and stigmatization, implies respecting the principle of proportionality between means and ends and a careful balancing of competing interests and objectives\u201d [3]. (b) a procedural dimension allowing to \u201ccontest and seek redress against decisions taken by AI systems or who operates them\u201d. To achieve this, the entity responsible for the decision must be identifiable, while decision making processes should be explainable. 4. Explainability: Being crucial for building and maintaining users trust in the AI system, explainability means that processes need to be transparent, the capabilities and purpose of AI systems openly communicated, and decision \u2013 to the extent possible \u2013 explainable to those directly and indirectly affected. When a decision cannot be duly contested (e.g., because explaining a particular model output or decision and what combination of input factors contributed to it is not always possible), then other explainability measures may be required (traceability, auditability and transparent communication on the capabilities of the AI system). This will depend on the context and severity of consequences if an output is erroneous. These ethical principles are placed in the context of AI systems. They act as ethical imperatives, and advocate for AI systems to strive to improve individual and collective wellbeing. As we can see, the mobilization has been worldwide: from the Montr\u00e9al Declaration for a responsible development of AI \u2013 an initiative of University of Montr\u00e9al \u2013, to the Ethics of AI recommendations led by international organizations such as UNESCO, passing by the adoption led by industry. All sets of principles share terminology, common grounds on human rights, and agree on the relevance of preserving human decisions and responsibilities, which are the most prominent features of ethics of AI. 3 A philosophical approach to Artificial Intelligence ethics Ethics is an academic discipline which is a subfield of philosophy and generally deals with questions such as \u201cWhat is a good action?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the value of a human life?\u201d, \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d, or \u201cWhat is the good life?\u201d [3]. Aligned with the European Commission ethics guidelines [3], our ethical vision of AI consists of five main actions [9]. These can help smooth the way to attain ethical AI. Next, we develop these, taking a philosophical approach to AI ethics: 1. Use philosophy and science to examine and critically discuss assumptions around the role that AI and humans play in these scenarios and discussions. For example, one could critically discuss claims that are made about the possibility of Artificial General Intelligence or human-level AI. Large language models, for instance, may give the impression that they have a human-like level of intelligence, but work very differently than the human brain and make many mistakes that humans would not make. This also leads to the question regarding the differences between humans and machine, and is also linked to the question concerning the moral status of AI. For example, it has been claimed that a chatbot was sentient, while it did not meet the criteria for sentience. That being said, it is not always clear what these criteria are. AI makes us re-visit philosophical questions concerning moral status. 2. Observe attentively the nature of AI and which functions it is assigned to perform today within its diversity of applications. We should recognize the pervasiveness of AI. One reason why it is important to ask ethical questions about AI is that it is pervasive: it is used in many applications such as search, text generation, recommendations for commercial products, and so on. In the ethical analysis, we need to pay attention to the details of each application 3. Discuss the most concrete and pressing ethical and social problems that AI presents in terms of how it is being applied today. AI raises a number of ethical questions such as privacy and data protection, safety, responsibility, and explainability. For example, a chatbot can encourage someone to take their life. Does this mean that the application is unsafe? How can we deal with this risk? And if something happens, who is responsible? Typically, there are many people involved in technological action. It is also important to be answerable to those who are affected by the technology [10], for example in the case of a suicide 6 6 https://coeckelbergh.medium.com/chatbots-can-kill-d82fde5cf6ca, accessed on June 08th, 2023. the company may need to be answerable to the family of the victim. Furthermore, it is important that when AI offers recommendations for decisions, it is clear on what basis these recommendations and decisions are taken. One problem is that this is usually not clear in the case of deep learning. In addition, there are societal implications such as potential unemployment caused by the automation that is enabled by AI, and the environmental costs of AI and its infrastructures through energy use and carbon emissions linked to the use of the algorithms, the storage of data, and the production of hardware. 4. Investigate AI policies for the near future. There are now already many policy documents on AI, for example the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI produced by the European Commission\u2019s High-Level Expert Group on AI [3] and the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence [5]. These documents need to be critically investigated. For example, in the beginning, less attention was given to environmental consequences of AI. A more general problem is that principles and lists of ethical considerations are not sufficient; there is still a gap between those principles and implementation in the technology, in standards, and in legal regulation. 5. Ask ourselves whether the attention that concentrates the public discourse in AI is useful as we face other problems, and whether AI should be our unique focus of attention. Given that we also face other global problems such as climate change and poverty, it is important to ask the question regarding prioritization: Is AI the most important problem we face? And if not \u2013 if, for instance, we insist on climate change being the main and most urgent global problem \u2013 how does AI impact and perhaps contribute to this problem, and how can it perhaps help to solve it? Reflection on these challenges will be important in the coming years. Once expressed the ethics of AI from the philosophical perspective, the next section will analyze the regulation of AI. 4 Artificial Intelligence regulation: A risk-based approach In the currently hot debate of AI, a fundamental aspect is regulating AI for it to be righteous. The most advanced regulation to date is the European Commission\u2019s AI Act proposal 7 7 On April 27th, 2023, the Members of European Parliament (MEPs) reached a political agreement on the AI Act, https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/meps-seal-the-deal-on-artificial-intelligence-act/, accessed on May 1st, 2023. for the regulation of AI [4]. In this section we are presenting AI regulation from two angles; first in Section 4.1 from the perspective of risk of AI systems and then, in Section 4.2, we make a deeper analysis into high-risk AI systems. 4.1 A risk-based approach to regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence systems The AI Act draft proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonized rules on AI [4] is the first attempt to enact a horizontal AI regulation. The proposed legal framework focuses on the specific use of AI systems. The European Commission proposes to establish a technology-neutral definition of AI systems in EU legislation and defines a classification for AI systems with different requirements and obligations tailored to a \u201crisk-based approach\u201d, where the obligations for an AI system are proportionate to the level of risk that it poses. The rules of the AI Act specifically consider the risks created by AI applications by proposing a list of high-risk applications, setting clear requirements for AI systems for high-risk applications, defining specific obligations for AI users and providers of high risk applications, proposing a conformity assessment before the AI system is put into service or placed on the market, proposing enforcement after it is placed in the market, and proposing a governance structure at European and national levels. The four levels of risk [4] outlined by the AI Act are the following (Fig. 2): \u2022 Minimal or No risk: The vast majority of AI systems currently used in the EU fall into this category. The proposal allows the free use of minimal-risk AI. Voluntarily, systems providers of those systems may choose to apply the requirements for trustworthy AI and adhere to voluntary codes of conduct (Art. 69 - Codes of Conduct). 9 9 Codes of conduct are encouraged by the Commission and the Member States to foster the voluntary application to AI systems other than high-risk AI systems (HRAIs) \u201con the basis of technical specification and solutions that are appropriate means of ensuring compliance with such requirements in light of the intended purpose of the systems\u201d (Art. 69). When a compliant AI systems presents a risk, the relevant operator will be required to take measures to ensure the system no longer presents that risk, withdraw the system from market, or recall the risk for a reasonable period commensurate with the nature of the risk (Art. 67 - Compliant AI systems which present a risk). For instance: AI-enabled video games or spam filters. \u2022 Limited risk: Systems such that users should be aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back. These have to comply with specific information/transparency obligations; for instance, chatbots, and systems generating deepfakes or synthetic content. \u2022 High-risk AI systems (HRAIs): Systems that can have a significant impact on the life chances of a user (Art. 6); they create an adverse impact on people\u2019s safety or their fundamental rights. 10 10 As protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (source: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_1683). Eight types of systems fall into this category; these are subject to stringent obligations and must undergo conformity assessments before being put on the European market, e.g. systems for law enforcement or access to education. They will always be high-risk when subject to third-party conformity assessment under that sectorial legislation. \u2022 Unacceptable risk: AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be prohibited in the EU market (Title II \u2014 Prohibited Artificial Intelligence Practices, Art. 5). For example: Social scoring, facial recognition, dark-patterns and manipulative AI systems, e.g., voice assistance systems that encourage dangerous behavior, or real time remote biometric identification systems in public spaces for law enforcement. As we can see, very differently to the Chinese, government-centric, approach, or the US industry-owned-data approach to AI, the EU is taking a human-centric approach to regulate the use of AI. This risk scenario-based approach regulates usages rather than models and technology themselves. This is the position we defend. Since the beginning of 2023, the European Parliament has been considering amendments to the law proposing how to conduct fundamental rights impact assessments and other obligations for users of HRAIs. Issues still to be finalized include closing the list of HRAI scenarios above exposed, prohibited practices, and details concerning the use of copyrighted content to train AI systems 11 11 Financial Times, European parliament prepares tough measures over use of AI, https://www.ft.com/content/addb5a77-9ad0-4fea-8ffb-8e2ae250a95a?shareType=nongift, accessed on April 25th, 2023. and the regulation of general purpose AI systems (GPAIS). 12 12 Privacy and Access Council of Canada, Five considerations to guide the regulation of \u201cGeneral Purpose AI\u201d, https://pacc-ccap.ca/five-considerations-to-guide-the-regulation-of-general-purpose-ai/, accessed on April 25th, 2023. The first consideration indicates the EU Parliament will force AI operators to reveal whether they use protected content. The second request emerges from the Privacy and Access Council of Canada, who agrees that GPAIS carry serious risks and harmful unintended consequences, and must not be exempt under the EU AI Act, or equivalent legislation elsewhere. A recent definition of GPAIS can be found in [13]: \u201cAn AI system that can accomplish a range of distinct valuable tasks, including some for which it was not specifically trained\u201d. It has also been referred to as foundation model [14, JRC Glossary, pag. 32] , but really a GPAIS refers to a model of different nature, beyond the generative AI or foundation models that can be considered as specific cases of GPAI systems. A point of agreement among all definitions to date is the capability of a GPAIS to accomplish tasks beyond those for which it was originally trained. This is one of the main reasons why GPAIS have become a pivotal topic of debate in what refers to AI regulation. Section 6.5 will delve further into this. 4.2 High-risk Artificial Intelligence systems The European AI Act is predicted to become the global standard for AI regulation 13 13 The EU AI Act\u2019s Risk-Based Approach: High-Risk Systems and What They Mean for Users, https://futurium.ec.europa.eu/en/european-ai-alliance/document/eu-ai-acts-risk-based-approach-high-risk-systems-and-what-they-mean-users, accessed on April 25th, 2023. by unifying within a single framework the concept of risk acceptability and the trustworthiness of AI systems by their users [15]. The risk-based approach of the AI Act specifically categorizes as HRAIs the following eight kind of AI systems (AI Act, Annex III \u2014 High-risk AI systems referred to in Art. 6(2) [4]): 1. Surveillance systems (e.g., biometric identification and facial recognition systems for law enforcement) 2. Systems intended for use as security components in the management and operation of critical digital infrastructures (road traffic and water, gas, heat and electricity supply). 3. Systems to determine access, admission or assignment of people to educational institutions or programs or to evaluate people (for the purpose of evaluating learning outcomes, learning processes or educational programs). 4. Systems intended to be used for recruitment or selection of personnel, screening or filtering of applications and evaluation of candidates, or systems for making decisions on promotion and termination of contractual relationships, assignment of tasks based on individual behavior and the evaluation of performance and behavior. 5. Systems for assessing the eligibility for public benefits or assistance, assessing creditworthiness or establishing credit scores. Systems for dispatching or prioritizing emergency first response services (firefighters, medical first aid, etc.). 6. Systems to assess the risk of a person committing crime or recidivism, or the risk that he or she is a potential offender. \u2022 Systems intended for use as polygraphs or to detect emotional state, or to assess the reliability of evidence in the course of an investigation or prosecution of crime. \u2022 Systems for predicting the occurrence or re-occurrence of crimes based on profiles of people or assessment of personality traits and characteristics or past criminal behavior. \u2022 Systems for profiling individuals by law enforcement authorities in the course of detecting, investigating or prosecuting crimes. 7. Systems intended for use by competent public authorities (such as polygraphs or to detect the emotional state of individuals): \u2022 Risk assessment systems, including security risks, irregular immigration or health risk posed by a person seeking to enter a member state. \u2022 Systems for the examination of applications for asylum, visas and residence permits and claims associated with the eligibility of people applying for status. 8. Systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes (intended to act on behalf of the authorities in the administration of justice for the interpretation of acts or law and the application of the law to a particular set of facts, or evaluation of reliability of evidence). One fact worth noting in the AI Act is its special emphasis on the importance of taking into account, when classifying AI systems, the result of the AI system in relation with the decision or action taken by a human, as well as the immediacy of its effect (AI Act Intro, (32) [4]). 5 Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: Pillars and requirements In a technical sense, trustworthiness is the confidence of whether a system/model will act as intended when facing a given problem [16]. This confidence generates trust in the user of the model (the audience), which can be supported from multiple perspectives. For instance, trust can be fostered when a system provides detailed explanations of its decisions [17]. As Lipton puts it, a person can be more confident when using a model if he/she understands how it works and how it produces its decisions [18]. Likewise, trust can be bolstered if the user is offered guarantees that the model can operate robustly under different circumstances, that it respects privacy, or that it does not get affected by biases present in the data from which it learns. Trustworthiness is, therefore, a multifaceted requisite for people and societies to develop, deploy and use AI systems, and a sine qua non condition for the realization of the potentially vast social and economic benefits AI can bring [3]. Moreover, trustworthy does not concern only the system itself, but also other actors and processes that take their part during the AI life cycle. This requires a holistic and systemic analysis of the pillars and requirements that contribute to the generation of trust in the user of an AI-based system. This section addresses this need by first dissecting the three pillars that set the basis for trustworthy AI \u2013 namely, lawfulness, ethics and robustness (Section 5.1) \u2013 followed by a thorough analysis of the seven requirements proposed by the European Commission\u2019s High-Level Expert Group (HLEG): human agency and oversight (Section 5.2); technical robustness and safety (Section 5.3); privacy and data governance (Section 5.4); Transparency (Section 5.5); diversity, non-discrimination and fairness (Section 5.6); societal and environmental wellbeing (Section 5.7); and accountability (Section 5.8). Definitions (what does the requirement stand for?), motivations (why is the requirement relevant for trustworthiness?) and a short glimpse at methodologies (how can the requirement be met in AI-based systems?) will be given for each of these requirements in their respective sections. 5.1 The three pillars of trustworthy Artificial Intelligence In general, a pillar can be understood as a fundamental truth of a given idea or concept, from which key requirements to realize the idea can be formulated. Similarly to construction engineering, pillars are essential for building up the concept of trustworthy AI: each pillar is necessary but not sufficient on its own to achieve trustworthy AI. Key requirements can contribute to one or several pillars, just like construction elements such as concrete, formwork or cantilevers are used to help pillars support the structure of the building. These requirements must be continuously ensured throughout the entire life cycle of AI systems, through methodologies that must not only be technical, but also involve human interaction. According to the EU Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy AI [3], pillars of trustworthy AI systems are defined as three basic properties that such systems should possess: \u2022 Pillar 1: Lawful. Trustworthy AI systems should comply with applicable laws and regulations, both horizontally (i.e. the European General Data Protection Regulation) and vertically (namely, domain-specific rules that are imposed in certain high-risk application domains, such as medical or finance). \u2022 Pillar 2: Ethical. Besides their compliance with the law, trustworthy AI systems should also adhere to ethical principles and values. The rapid technological development of current AI-based system rises ethical questions that are not always addressed synchronously by regulatory efforts. The democratized usage of large language models and misinformation using deepfakes are two avant-garde exponents of the relevance of Ethics as one of the pillars of trustworthy AI. \u2022 Pillar 3: Robust. Trustworthy AI systems should guarantee that they will not cause any unintentional harm, working in a safe and reliable fashion from both technical (performance, confidence) and social (usage, context) perspectives. Trustworthy AI stands on these three pillars. Ideally, they should act in harmony and pushing in synergistic directions towards the realization of trustworthy AI. However, tensions may arise between them: for instance, what is legal is not always ethical. Conversely, ethical issues may require the imposition of law amendments that become in conflict with prevalent regulations. Trustworthy AI must guarantee ethical principles and values, obey the laws, and operate robustly so as to attain its expected impact on the socioeconomic environment in which it is applied. The above three pillars lie at the heart of the HLEG guidelines [3], which establish the seven requirements for trustworthy AI. As depicted in Fig. 3, each requirement spans several components or dimensions in which the requirement becomes of special relevance for the design and operation of an AI-based system. Apart from recommending technical and non technical methods, the guidelines also include an Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, ALTAI, for self-assessment of AI systems and for making the 7 requirements operative [19]. The next subsections elaborate in detail on these requirements: 5.2 Requirement 1: Human agency and oversight WHAT does it mean? AI systems should empower human beings, allowing them to make informed decisions and fostering their fundamental rights. At the same time, proper oversight mechanisms need to be ensured, which can be achieved through human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, and human-in-command approaches. In other words, AI-based systems must support human autonomy and decision making. WHY is it important for trustworthiness? This requirement is necessary for autonomy and control. The unfair manipulation, deception, herding and conditioning of AI-based systems can be a threat to the individual autonomy, rights and freedom of their users. Therefore, trustworthy AI systems should provide the means for the user to supervise, evaluate and freely adopt/override a decision made by such systems, avoiding decisions that are automatically made without humans being involved in the process. HOW can this requirement be met in practice? Two dimensions underlie this first requirement, namely, human agency (Section 5.2.1) and human oversight (Section 5.2.2). We now analyze different methodological approaches that can be adopted in these two dimensions: 5.2.1 Human agency Mechanisms for human oversight will depend on the area of application and potential risk. For the preservation of human rights, human-compatible [20], human-centric approaches [14,21,22], AI for social good [7,23] and human computation or interactive machine learning [24] are computing paradigms aligned with this requirement. However, more structured toolkits (along the lines of [25] or C-Suite [26]) will need to be materialized for a smooth domain-specific consideration of this requirement. In terms of technical tools to reach different audiences, language appears as the universal means of communication among humans and machines, and thus, AI models using natural language processing and/or counterfactual and natural language explanations [27] will be relevant to help humans supervise and take the most appropriate decision based on the output of AI systems. 5.2.2 Human oversight Different degrees of human involvement in the supervision of AI-based systems can be specified [3]: \u2022 Human-in-the-loop (HITL), which refers to the ability of the supervisor to intervene in every decision cycle of the system being monitored [24]. \u2022 Human-on-the-loop (HOTL), which stands for human intervention during the design and monitoring cycles of the AI-based system. \u2022 Human-in-command (HIC), namely, the capability of the supervisor to oversee the overall activity of the AI system including its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impacts, and ensuring that decisions produced by the AI system can be overridden by the human. Depending on the application under consideration, mechanisms supporting one of the above levels of human oversight can be designed. Methods proposed so far are largely domain-specific, since user-algorithm interfaces vary depending on the capabilities and background of the supervisor and the design of the AI-based solution. 5.3 Requirement 2: Technical robustness and safety WHAT does it mean? This second requirement includes several functionalities all aligned with the prevention of unintentional harm and the minimization of the consequences of intentional harm. These include the resilience of AI-based systems (to attacks and security), ensuring fallback plans (in case something goes wrong), general safety, and being accurate, reliable and reproducible. Robustness and safety refer to the need of AI systems to be secure, reliable and robust enough to errors and/or inconsistencies in all phases of the life cycle [28]. WHY is it important for trustworthiness? AI-based systems deployed on real-world scenarios can undergo changes in their operating environment that can induce changes at their inputs (e.g. concept drift). Likewise, such changes can be the result of the interaction of malicious users with the AI-based system in an adversarial fashion. Disregarding whether such changes are intentional or not, the trustworthiness of the AI-based system is subject to the capability of the model to mitigate the impact of these changes in their issued predictions. Likewise, in risk-critical applications trustworthy AI systems should evaluate relevant safety measures and endowed with functionalities to fall back when the AI-based system deviates from its expected behavior as per the monitored measures. Finally, reliability and reproducibility connects tightly with trustworthiness in what refers to the verification of the expected operation and performance of AI-based systems. When AI-based systems are to be used in different contexts and deployed in different systems, such components are vital to ensure that the system at hand resiliently accommodates the differences and particularities that may arise in each context/system, ultimately working as expected. HOW can this requirement be met in practice? Methodologies that can be explored to support this requirement can be analyzed over three dimensions: technical robustness (Section 5.3.1), safety (Section 5.3.2) and reproducibility (Section 5.3.3). 5.3.1 Technical robustness When dealing with an AI-based system, robustness and reliability are properties that refer to the ability of the system to have comparable performance on atypical data with respect to typical operational regimes [29]. Robustness can be established in the face of different circumstances: when we hope a model to be robust, it is due to the fact that the model may degrade, be perturbed or affected during its future usage. It is desirable to have a model that is robust in terms of its generalization or generative capabilities, against adversarial attacks or models, or against data perturbations. Systematically, several levels of robustness can be distinguished in AI-based systems [30]: \u2022 Level 0 (no robustness or standard training): this first level of robustness refers to the one provided by the AI-based system by itself, without any risk mitigation functionalities or additions added to its design. This level concerns generalization capabilities such as being robust to distributional changes caused by spurious features or data instances. Despite the lack of specific risk mitigation measures, some naive information provided by certain naive AI models (e.g. quantification of epistemic confidence) can be exploited to detect when the AI-based system is not working in its expected operational regime. \u2022 Level 1 (generalization under distribution shifts): this second level of robustness considers techniques aimed to mitigate different types of changes in data. Data changes or shifts include covariate shift, prior probability shift, concept drift and confounding shift, depending on the change happening in the distribution of the input variables, the output of the model, the statistical relationship between the inputs and outputs, or the change of a variable that influences both inputs and outputs, respectively [31]. In this level we can also place the generalized framework of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection [32], which refers to anomaly detection, novelty detection and open set recognition, the latter referring to the capability of the model to detect, characterize and incorporate new unknown patterns to its knowledge base (e.g. new classes in a classification problem). Level 1 of robustness against these data shifts can be approached by concept drift detection and adaptation techniques, OoD detection methods or class-incremental learning schemes, to mention a few. \u2022 Level 2 (robustness against a single risk): this third worst-case robustness tackles a single point of risk, e.g., the presence of adversarial examples. Assessing this level requires model inspection and intervention (e.g., active model scanning, probing to find failure cases, adversarial defenses against different attack modes). \u2022 Level 3 (robustness against multiple risks): It extends the former to multiple risks (e.g., common data corruptions, spurious correlations). \u2022 Level 4 (universal robustness): this level is reached by AI-based systems that are proven to be effectively robust to all known risks. \u2022 Level 5 (human-aligned and augmented robustness): it furthers complements level 4 by aligning human-centered values and user feedback, automatically augmenting existing robustness demands as per the requirements, context and usage of the AI-based system. This level should be targeted by high-risk AI-powered applications. The robustness of the AI-system system should be a core part of the risk management strategy adopted by the owner of the system itself, hence becoming a core part of their accountability procedures. Indeed, AI maintenance frameworks should ease achieving robustness and AI status tracking and control through the AI life cycle [33]. Monitoring can be produced either passively (by periodically measuring different quantitative metrics related to robustness over the data, model, or both) or actively emulating the circumstances under which the robustness of the model can be thought to be compromised (e.g. emulated adversarial attack instances or perturbations of known samples). In both cases, AI maintenance frameworks can detect model degradation through time by detecting systematic deviations of the aforementioned metrics in data and models [34]. Interestingly, areas currently under study in AI research aim in this direction, endowing AI-based systems with the ability to learn continually from infinite streams of varying data [35], to quantify and communicate their confidence in their outputs [36], or to characterize and consolidate new patterns arising from data over time [37]. We end the discussion about how technical robustness can be supported in AI-based systems by highlighting the potential that techniques used to address other requirements can bring to technical robustness. For instance, explainability techniques can help make models more robust, since they can show which features are more stable to out of distribution changes in the input or adversarial attacks. Likewise, the intensity of changes needed to reach a target adversarial confidence score in counterfactual generation can be a reliable estimator of the extent to which a certain data instance can be considered to be out of distribution [38]. All in all, these examples are a few among the multiple cases in which a functionality added to an AI-based system can simultaneously contribute to several requirements for trustworthiness. 5.3.2 Safety Evolving from a generic Information Technologies context, safety in AI [39\u201341] is developing in relation to the alignment with human values. In this sense, concrete protocols and procedures are challenging to define, but necessary for AI safety. Safety in AI concerns several unsolved research issues [40], including: \u2022 Attaining robustness as the objective of withstanding hazards, and building systems less vulnerable to adversarial threats such as adversarial perturbations which cause high confidence mistakes, and robust to long tails. \u2022 Facilitating tools to inspect AI-based systems, identify hazards and anomalies, calibrate them, identify honest outputs, and detect emergent capabilities. One risk of AI systems that links with the need for safety tools is that they may carry backdoors [42]: backdoored models behave correctly in nearly all scenarios, except in chosen scenarios taught to behave incorrectly due to the training on poisoned data as a way to have backdoors injected. These are problematic, specially in foundational models that serve as the architectural backbone of downstream models, all evolved from originally poisoned data from massive training datasets [40]. \u2022 Defining safety objectives in order to steer models, either internally (how models should learn to guarantee compliance with safety metrics) and externally (how such safety compliance can be safely pursued). Problems in this regard include: \u2013 Value learning, as the inability of AI systems to code human values (e.g., happiness, sustainability, meaningful experiences or safe outcomes). Although giving open-world inputs to models can partially tell apart pleasant and unpleasant states, utility values of such states are no ground truth values, and are a result of the model\u2019s own learned utility function [43]. \u2013 Proxy gaming: This is a phenomenon due to the fact that optimizers and adversaries can manipulate objective proxies. As Goodhart\u2019s law states, a measure ceases to be a reliable indicator when it becomes the target. For instance, proxy gaming occurs as reward hacking in reinforcement learning. Similarly, objective countable metrics end up substituting human values when opaque AI models are forced to learn by optimizing a single quantitative measure. 14 14 These are also known as weapons of math destruction [44] that may contain pernicious feedback loops that perpetuate stereotypes and biases [45] if they do not consider context nor a concrete person\u2019s features, but rather those of its neighbors. Therefore, merely acquiring a proxy for human values is insufficient: models must also be resilient to solvers seeking to manipulate it. 5.3.3 Reproducibility Once robustness and safety have been addressed, an important dimension in this key requirement for trustworthy AI is reproducibility. It can be defined as the ability of AI experiments to exhibit the same behavior when repeated under the same conditions. Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to the capability to independently achieve non-identical conclusions that are at least similar while differences in sampling, research procedures and data analyses may exist [14]. Since both concepts are essential parts of the scientific method, the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) redefine these concepts as: \u2022 Repeatability (same team, same experimental setup), which means that an individual or a team of individuals can reliably repeat his/her/their own experiment. \u2022 Replicability (different team, same experimental setup): an independent group of individuals can obtain the same result using artifacts which they independently develop in their entirety. \u2022 Reproducibility (different team, different experimental setup with stated precision): a different independent group can obtain the same result using their own artifacts. It should be clear that when formulated in the context of trustworthy AI systems, one should regard an experiment in the above definitions as the performance, robustness and safety evaluation of a given AI-based system. This evaluation can be done by different groups (as in research) or by a certification lab (as in commercial software-based solutions). The extent to which reproducibility can be guaranteed in trustworthy AI systems depends on the confidentiality of the system or the singularity of the experimental setup for which the AI-based system was developed, among other constraining circumstances. For instance, in mild contexts (as in research), reproducibility of experiments by third parties is often favored by public releases of the source code implementing the AI-based system being proposed. 5.4 Requirement 3: Privacy and data governance WHAT does it mean? This requirements assures the respect for privacy and data protection thorough the AI system life cycle (design, training, testing, deployment and operation), adequate data governance mechanisms taking into account the quality and integrity of the data and its relevance to the domain, and also ensures legitimized access to data and processing protocols. WHY is it important for trustworthiness? AI systems based on digital records of human behavior can be capable of inferring individual preferences and reveal personal sensitive information such as the sexual orientation, age, gender, religious or political views. Since AI-based systems learn from data, systems must guarantee that such personal information is not revealed while data is processed, stored and retrieved throughout the AI life cycle, facilitating means to trace how data is used (governance) and verifying that protected information is not accessed (privacy awareness) during the life cycle phases. If such guarantees are not provided, AI-based systems will not be trusted by end users, nor will they conform to existing legislation (e.g. the European GDPR). Citizens should have full control over their data, and their data will not be unlawfully or unfairly used to harm or discriminate against them [28]. This requirement is important to preserve human rights such as the right to privacy, intimacy, dignity or the right to be forgotten. Keeping the usage and scope of the data limited, protected and informed is paramount, since digital information can be used towards clustering a person into profiles that may not reflect reality, while reinforcing stereotypes, historical differences among minorities, or perpetuate historical or cultural biases [44]. HOW can this requirement be met in practice? In the following we analyze technologies that can maintain data privacy in AI-based systems (Section 5.4.1), and strategies to deal with data governance as quality and integrity processes (Section 5.4.2). 5.4.1 Data privacy In order to land down the data privacy requirement into actual technologies, we emphasize the relevance of Federated learning (FL) [46,47], homomorphic computing [48] and differential privacy (DP) [49] as examples of privacy-aware technologies in the current AI landscape: \u2022 In FL, a model is trained across multiple decentralized devices without moving the data to a central location. In doing so, instead of delivering all the data to a central server, devices learn models locally using their own data, so that only numerical model updates are sent to the central server. The central server aggregates the updated model parameters from all the devices or servers to create a new model. This allows learning a global model leveraging all data in situations where the data is sensitive. Besides preserving the privacy of local data, FL can reduce communication costs and accelerate the model training. \u2022 In homomorphic computing, data can be processed in encrypted form without the need for deciphering it first. As a result, data remains secure and private by performing operations directly on encrypted data. By using specially devised mathematical operations, the underlying structure of data is preserved while it is processed, so that the result of the computation, which is also encrypted, stays the same. Only authorized parties having the decryption key can access this information. Homomorphic computing can be an effective way to implement privacy-aware preprocessing, training and inference in AI-based systems. \u2022 Finally, DP enables processing and learning from data while minimizing the risk of identifying individuals in the dataset at hand. To this end, DP injects random noise to the data before it is processed. This noise is calibrated to guarantee that the data remains statistically accurate, while concealing any information that could be used to identify individuals and thereby, compromise their privacy. The amount of noise added to data balances between the level of privacy protection provided by DP and the performance degradation of the AI-based system when compared to the case when no noise is injected. By resorting to any of the above technologies (also combinations of them), the privacy of individuals in the datasets is preserved, minimizing their risk of harm. 5.4.2 Data governance: Quality and integrity of data and access to data Data protocols must govern data integrity and access for all individuals even if these are not users of the AI system. Only duly qualified staff, with explicit need and competence, should be allowed to access individuals\u2019 data. As a part of AI governance, data governance calls for a broader level regulation than a single country or continent regulation. This context has motivated guidelines and recommendations for AI governance over the years emphasizing on the importance of ensuring data quality, integrity and access. An example can be found in the Universal Guidelines for AI published in 2018 [50], which were endorsed by 70 organizations and 300 experts across 40 countries. In these guidelines, Data Quality Obligation was established as one of the principles that should be incorporated into ethical standards, adopted in regulations and international agreements, and embedded into the design of AI-based systems. These recommendations helped inform the OECD AI Principles (2019), the UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics (2021), the OSTP AI Bill of Rights (2022), and the EU AI Act and the Council of Europe Convention on AI. In terms of guidelines to implement data governance, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Officer (ICO) has proposed recommendations on how to use AI and personal data appropriately and lawfully [51]. Among these, there are actions such as taking a risk-based approach when developing and deploying AI \u2013 \u201caddressing risk of bias and discrimination at an early stage\u201d, \u201censuring that human reviews of decisions made by AI is meaningful\u201d, \u201ccollect only data needed and no more\u201d, and \u201cworking with external suppliers to ensure the use of AI will be appropriate\u201d. At the European level, the European Strategy for Data established in 2020 aims at making the EU a role model for a society empowered by data. This strategy has given rise to the European Data Governance Act [52] to facilitate data sharing across sectors and Member States. In particular, the EU Data Governance Act intends to make public sector data available for re-use, promote data sharing among businesses, allow the use of personal data through a \u201cpersonal data-sharing intermediary\u201d, help exercising rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and allowing data use on altruistic grounds [52]. Later in 2022, the European Union strategy for data proposed the Data Act [53], 15 15 Data Act & Data Act Factsheet, https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-act, accessed on April 25th, 2023. a regulation harmonizing rules on fair access to and use of data. In practice this regulation complements the Data Governance Act by specifying who can create value from data and under which circumstances. In practice, the Data Act will take action to (1) increase legal certainty for companies and consumers who generate data, on who can use what data and under which conditions, (2) prevent abuse of contractual imbalances that hinder fair data sharing. (3) provide means to the public sector to access data of interest held by the private sector; (4) set the framework conditions for customers. Therefore, the benefits of the Data Act for consumers and business include, from achieving cheaper aftermarket prices for connected objects, to new opportunities to use services based on data access, and better access to data produced by devices. Serving these two EU regulations, ten European common data spaces exist, ranging from industry to mobility. 5.5 Requirement 4: Transparency WHAT does it mean? Transparency is the property that ensures appropriate information reaches the relevant stakeholders [29]. When it comes to AI-based systems, different levels of transparency can be distinguished [54]: simulatability (of the model by a human), its decomposability (the ability to explain the model behavior and its parts), and algorithmic transparency (understanding the process of the model and how it will act for any output). Another classification establishes transparency at the algorithmic, interaction and social levels [55], emphasizing the role of the stakeholder audience to which the explanation is targeted: developer, designer, owner, user, regulator or society. WHY is it important for trustworthiness? In the context of trustworthy AI systems, data, the system itself and AI business models should be transparent. Humans must be informed of systems capabilities and limitations and always be aware that they are interacting with AI systems [3]. Therefore, explanations should be timely, adapted and communicated to the stakeholder audience concerned (layperson regulator, researcher or other stakeholder), and traceability of AI systems should be ensured. HOW can this requirement be met in practice? The dimensions to be treated within this requirement concern traceability, explainability and communication, which are essential for realizing transparent AI-based systems. In the following we will first explain what traceability stands for (Section 5.5.1), the current state of the art on explainable AI (Section 5.5.2), and mechanisms for communicating AI systems decisions (Section 5.5.3). 5.5.1 Traceability Traceability is defined as the set of mechanisms and procedures aimed to keep track of the system\u2019s data, development and deployment processes, normally through documented recorded identification [14]. Traceability and logging from the early design stages of the AI-based systems can help auditing and achieving the required level of transparency according to the needs of the concerned audience. In this regard, special attention must be paid to provenance tools [56], which ease the traceability or lineage of data and model decisions, hence contributing to the requirement of transparency. In this area, the use of Blockchain mechanisms are promising towards guaranteeing the integrity of data used to train (and explain) machine learning models, i.e., the provenance of databases, their associated quality, bias and fairness. 5.5.2 Explainability The so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) [54] field is widely and globally being recognized as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of trustworthy AI models. Existing literature and contributions already made in this field include broad insights into what is yet to be achieved [54,57,58]. Efforts have been invested towards defining explainability in machine learning, extending previous conceptual propositions and requirements for responsible AI by focusing on the role of the particular audience for which explanations are to be generated [54]: Given an audience, an explainable AI is one that produces details or reasons to make its functioning clear or easy to understand. Explainability techniques are blooming as tools to support algorithmic auditing. They have emerged as a necessary step to validate and understand the knowledge captured by black-box models, i.e., a system in which only inputs and outputs are observed without knowing the internal details of how it works. This can be problematic, as we cannot predict how the system may behave in unexpected situations (connecting with the technical robustness requirement, Section 5.3), or how it can be corrected if something goes wrong (linked to the accountability requirement, Section 5.8). Explaining which input factors contribute to the decisions of complex black-box algorithms can provide a useful global view of how the model works, jointly with traceability methods and a clear and adapted communication of information to the target audience. Since the quality of explanations depends on the audience and the motivation for which they are generated, several taxonomies of XAI techniques have been proposed over the years [54]. A primary distinction can be done between model-agnostic and model-specific approaches to explaining machine learning models, the difference being whether the XAI technique can be applied to any machine learning model disregarding their structure and learning algorithm. Another distinction can be done between ex-ante and post-hoc XAI techniques, depending on the moment at which explainability is addressed (before or after the model is designed and trained). On one hand, ex-ante techniques (also referred to as the explainable-by-design paradigm) make AI models aspire to provide an explanation that avoids the construction of additional models or extra complexity (layers or mechanisms not originally part of the original one), so that explanations are as faithful to the real reasoning carried out by the model as possible. On the other hand, post-hoc XAI techniques usually add artifacts around the original AI model or build a surrogate of it \u2013 a local approximation or simpler version of the original one \u2013 in order to more easily explain the original one (for example, LIME [59]). Likewise, some XAI techniques may use external knowledge (e.g. from the web, Wikipedia, forums) [60], for instance, to explain language models or dialogue models that interactively answer questions about a model\u2019s particular decision. Other criteria to categorize XAI tools can be formulated, such as the format of the issued explanations (e.g., attribution methods [61], counterfactual studies [62], simplified model surrogates [63]) or the hybridization of explanations expressed in different modalities, such as visual and textual (e.g., linguistic summaries [64], ontologies [65], or logical rules defined on top of knowledge graphs [66], to cite a few). Natural language explanations [27,67], quantitative measures of the quality of explanations [68,69], and models that support their learning process with formal symbolic basis such as language, rules, compositional relationships or knowledge graphs (neural-symbolic learning and reasoning [66]) are key for explanations to be understood by non-expert audience. These interfaces allow such users to assess the operation of the model in a more intelligible fashion, hence supporting the human agency and oversight requirement for trustworthy AI systems (Section 5.2). 5.5.3 Communication The third dimension of transparency is how the audience is informed about the AI-based system, namely, how explanations or information tracked about the system\u2019s operation is communicated to the user. Humans should know when they are interacting with AI systems, as well as be notified about their performance, instructed about their capabilities, and warned about their limitations. The same holds when conveying the model\u2019s output explanation and its functioning to the user. The adaptation of the explanation must be in accordance to the specifics of the AI system being explained and the cognitive capabilities (knowledge, background expertise) of the audience. Therefore, communication is a crucial dimension, so that all aspects related to transparency are delivered to the audience in a form and format adapted to their background and knowledge. This is key to attain trust in the audience about the AI-based system at hand. 5.6 Requirement 5: Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness WHAT does it mean? This requirement contemplates different dimensions: the avoidance of unfair bias, diversity fostering, accessibility to all regardless any disability, and the involvement of stakeholders in the entire AI system life cycle. All these dimensions of this manifold requirement share an ultimate purpose: to ensure that AI-based systems do not deceive humans nor limit their freedom of choice without reason. Therefore, it is a requirement tightly linked to the ethical and fairness principles that underlie trustworthiness in AI (Section 2). WHY is it important for trustworthiness? This requirement is necessary to broaden the impact of AI to all social substrates, as well as to minimize the negative effects that automated decisions may have in practice if data inherits biases hidden in the data from which models are learned. Unfair bias in data must be avoided as decisions drawn by a model learned from such data could have multiple negative implications, including the marginalization of vulnerable groups, the exacerbation of prejudice or discrimination [3]. HOW can this requirement be met in practice? Methods to tackle this requirement can be classified depending on the specific dimension they support: as such, methods to enforce diversity, non-discrimination, accessibility, universal design and stakeholder participation are briefly revisited in Section 5.6.1, whereas Section 5.6.2 describes how to achieve fairness in AI-based systems. Finally, Section 5.6.3 examines mechanisms to avoid unfair bias. 5.6.1 Diversity, non-discrimination, accessibility, universal design and stakeholder participation AI systems should take into account all human abilities, skills and requirements, and ensure accessibility to them. Developing methodologies based on the requirement of non-discrimination and bias mitigation is paramount to ensure the alignment of requirements to the compliance with ethical values. Assuring properties of non-discrimination, fairness and bias mitigation restrict the systematic differences treating certain groups (of people or objects) with respect to others [29]. A practical example of recommendation encourages, e.g., hiring from diverse backgrounds, cultures and disciplines to assure opinion diversity. This requirement involves the inclusion of diverse data and people, and ensures that individuals at risk of exclusion have equal access to AI benefits. Concrete implementations of this requirement range from quantifying the impact of demographic imbalance [70] and the effects of missing data (which, as a matter of fact, has been shown to be beneficial in terms of fairness metrics [71]). In what refers to diversity, it advocates for the needs for heterogeneous and randomly sampling procedures for data acquisition, diverse representation of a population that includes minorities, and the assurance for non-discriminating automated processes that lead to unfairness or biased models. Diversity can be applied at the technical level during model training by penalizing the lack of diverse prototypes on latent space areas with challenging separation between classes [72]. Alternatively, the lack of diversity can be counteracted by means of imbalanced learning or by informing data augmentation. When placing the focus on the solutions of an AI-based system, their diversity is a very relevant component to guarantee non-biased outcomes. Frameworks unifying quality and diversity optimization can guarantee the diversity of generated solutions that may later serve in robotics to learn behaviorally diverse policies [73]. From a global perspective, the so-called discrimination-conscious by-design paradigm collective refers to methodologies where discrimination detection and prevention is considered from the beginning of the design of the AI-based system through fairness [74]. Methods adopting this paradigm include discrimination-aware data mining [75], compositional fairness, interpretation of sanity checks and ablation studies. In summary, diversity must be enforced both in the data from which models are learned and among the stakeholders, i.e., fostering the inclusion of minorities (practitioners and users) [7,22] or using methodologies such as participatory design for accessibility [76]. Universal Design principles, which consider accessibility and \u201cdesign for all\u201d [3] during development, governance, policy and decision making processes is one way to facilitate AI life cycles that take into account what is beneficial for everyone, accounting for different conditions and situations, and no discrimination. To further enable universal design and stakeholder participation, often feedback \u2013 even after deployment \u2013 is sought for stakeholder participation and consultation. One way to achieve this is through active learning for machine learning systems. Active learning allows for the integration of users\u2019 feedback while models are learned, and enables interactivity with the user, one of the goals targeted by human-centered AI [77] and AI for social good [23]. 5.6.2 Fairness The second dimension of this requirement is fairness, namely, techniques aimed to reduce the presence of unfair outputs elicited by AI-based systems. An unfair algorithm can be defined as that producing decisions that favor a particular group of people. Following the comprehensive view on this topic published in [78], biases leading to such unfair decisions can be propagated from the data to the AI algorithm (including measurement, omitted variable sampling, or representation biases, among others); from the algorithm to the user (as in algorithmic, popularity or evaluation biases); or from the user to the data (respectively, biases induced in the production of content, temporal, historical and/or social biases). Fairness guarantees in the decisions of AI-based systems has been approached extensively in the literature, reporting bias targeting methods that can be classified in three large groups: \u2022 Pre-processing methods, where the available data are transformed for the source of bias to be reduced and at best, removed. \u2022 In-processing methods, which modify the learning algorithm of the model at hand (by e.g. changing the objective function at hand or imposing constraints to the optimization problem) so as to minimize the effect of biases in the training process. \u2022 Post-processing methods, which operate on the output of the model (for instance, by reassigning the predicted class for a query instance) without modifying its learning algorithm or the training data from which it was learned. In general, it is widely acknowledged that fairness can be achieved by sacrificing accuracy to a certain extent [79]. However, it is also possible to debias machine learning models from the influence of spurious features to even improve their performance [80]. Another trade-off is between fairness and privacy. Here, adversarial learning [81] can simultaneously learn a predictor and an adversary that models a protected variable, and by minimizing the adversary capacity to predict this protected variable, accurate predictions can show less stereotyping of the protected variable, almost achieving equality of odds as a fairness notion. An important concept to be acquainted with when dealing with fairness in AI-based systems is fairwashing: as a risk of rationalization, fairwashing is the promotion of a false perception that a machine learning model respects ethical values through an outcome explanation and fairness metric [82]. This makes it critical to characterize the manipulability of fairwashing [83], as well as LaundryML approaches [82] to better audit unfair opaque models. 5.6.3 Avoidance of unfair bias Data and models can be exposed to a large set of potential bias-inducing phenomena. Ensuring diversity, representativeness and completeness in data and models needs to be a core part of the full AI life cycle (design, development and deployment phases of AI-based systems). Bias can be uncovered through proxy discrimination by models, since proxy variables are likely to be picked up, showing features as proxy that otherwise would not have been considered, i.e., zip codes in predictive policing [44]. As has been shown in the previous dimension, bias is not only algorithmic, but extends beyond the limits of models in a vicious cycle: starting with human activity bias, data bias, leads to sampling bias on the web (specially to be considered in the use of data to learn generative models), algorithmic bias, interaction bias and finally, self-selection bias that can revert back into the algorithm a second-order bias [84]. Bias mitigation techniques include several approaches [45,85], from generic requirements and toolboxes [86] to concrete taxonomies of bias [87,88] at different stages of the AI life cycle [89]. Different notions of fairness can be also defined [78,90], including causal fairness \u2013 which relies on causal relations and requires establishing causal graphs \u2013 or counterfactual fairness. Causality can help debugging algorithmic bias mitigation or explaining models [91], e.g., causal mediation analysis can help uncover disparate impact of models by estimating the fairness associated to different explaining variables [92]. 5.7 Requirement 6: Societal and environmental wellbeing WHAT does it mean? AI-based systems should benefit all humankind, not only at the present time but also in future generations. Therefore, AI-based systems must be sustainable and environmentally friendly, so that the technological adoption of AI does not entail a progressive depletion of natural resources and maintains an ecological balance [29]. Therefore, dimensions supporting this requirement include sustainability and environmental friendliness, as well as a careful assessment of the social and societal impacts of AI. WHY is it important for trustworthiness? AI systems should increase positive social change and enhance sustainability and ecological responsibility. Although they can be an effective tool to mitigate climate change [93,94], greenhouse gases emitted by the computationally intensive training processes of complex AI-based systems can exacerbate existing social and ethical challenges linked to AI [95]. For instance, training only one single AI model can emit as many CO2 emissions as five cars in their entire lifetime. Computational and environmental costs grow proportionally to the complexity of the model in terms of its number of parameters [96]. In particular, this study was done for large language models [97] which cost about 8.4 tons per year, where an average carbon footprint for a person yearly is around 4. Although emissions are amortized over the model lifetime, the recent ChatGPT model was estimated to consume 1287 MWh that translates into a cost of 522 tCO2e [98]. Therefore, energy and policy considerations are to be taken into account by institutions and companies implementing AI [97]. HOW can this requirement be met in practice? This requirement is currently approached from two different angles: sustainability and environmental wellbeing (Section 5.7.1) and societal wellbeing (Section 5.7.2). 5.7.1 Sustainability and environmental wellbeing Sustainable AI [99] considers a holistic perspective that spans from models to data algorithms and hardware, and how software\u2013hardware co-design can help mitigate carbon footprints of AI model life cycles (design, training and deployment stages). As mentioned previously, sustainable AI finds its motivation in the costly energy consumption of large AI models. Thus, sharing key learned lessons, best design practices, metrics, and standards is key for a sustainable development of AI systems. Technical contributions aimed to implement this requirement for the sustainability of AI are at the core of the Green AI research area [100], which studies efficient and ecologically aware designs of AI-based algorithms, systems and assets. Many strategies to attain this requirement have been proposed over the years to reduce the environmental impact of AI models, with emphasis on those characterized by a large number of parameters and requiring long training latencies (e.g., deep neural networks). Among others: \u2022 Assessment of the environmental impact of AI-based systems with e.g., carbon footprint calculators 16 16 Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator, https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references, accessed on April 25th, 2023. [101]. Evaluating the factors that influence AI\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions is the first step towards mitigating its negative effects [95]. \u2022 Selection of the most relevant and necessary data, i.e., with smart data approaches [102]. \u2022 Model compression [103,104], e.g. using quantization [105], distillation techniques [106,107] or acceleration [108] techniques. \u2022 Consideration of efficiency as an evaluation metric and as a price tag to make models greener and more inclusive for researchers having limited resources [100]. \u2022 Use of models that can rapidly adapt to new situations, domains and similar tasks by virtue of learning functionalities specifically devoted to this adaptation (e.g., multitask, few-shot learning, AutoML, meta-learning, neural architecture search or open-ended learning. This family of GPAIS can provide more efficient, sustainable and less data depending AI systems. \u2022 Deployment of models on cloud computing servers fed with renewable energy sources, to minimize CO2 emissions. 5.7.2 Societal wellbeing At the societal level, AI can improve social welfare. AI-based systems can perform routine tasks in an autonomous safer, and more efficient fashion, enhancing productivity and improving the quality of life of humankind. In the public administration AI can speed up processes, smooth administrative bottlenecks and save paperwork. Furthermore, it can aid policy making and help city planners, e.g., by visualizing the consequences of climate change, predicting future floods, or identifying urban heat islands. Possibilities for the society at large to benefit from AI developments have exploded in recent years with the progressive digitization of almost all sectors of activity. Infrastructure planning, health and hunger, equality and inclusion, education, economic empowerment, security and justice are among those sectors where AI can unleash its full potential to foster use cases of societal impact. Bringing such benefits of AI into practice is, therefore, a matter of leveraging such amounts of available data in AI-based systems. Such AI-based systems address learning tasks that solve a problem of societal impact, such as the ones exemplified above. However, since decisions issued by the AI-based system affect human beings and are subject to social scrutiny, other requirements of trustworthy AI become of utmost relevance, including fairness, privacy, transparency or human oversight. Above all, the importance of AI ethics and regulation becomes paramount in societal wellbeing, since decisions issued in use cases arising in education, justice and security have to comply with fundamental human rights and the legal restrictions in force. 5.8 Requirement 7: Accountability WHAT does it mean? This last requirement of trustworthy AI systems imposes the provision of mechanisms to ensure responsibility and accountability for the development, deployment, maintenance and-or use of AI systems and their outcomes. Auditability, which enables the assessment of algorithms, data and design processes, plays a key role in accountability, namely, the attribution of the results of the actions that were taken based on the outcome of the AI-based system. Accountability, therefore, implies the minimization of harm and reporting of negative impact, the communication of design trade-offs to the user, and the implementation of adequate and accessible redress strategies associated to AI-based systems. Therefore, auditability and accountability are closely related to each other and lie at the core of responsible AI systems, which are later discussed in Section 6.1. WHY is it important for trustworthiness? The required auditability property of Trustworthy AI systems demands the development of practical tools [109] that are capable of verifying desirable properties of neural networks such as stability, sensitivity, relevance or reachability [110], as well as metrics beyond explainability [111\u2013115], such as on traceability, data quality and integrity. Auditability is becoming increasingly important when standards are being materialized touching upon all AI requirements. This includes IEEE, ISO/IEC and CEN/CENELEC, which are implementing concrete guidelines to apply trustworthy AI requirements in industrial setups (see [11,29] for an overview). At the national level, the German standardization road map on AI within DIN/DKE [11] is a clear exponent of the standardization efforts made by different governments to dictate how practical AI-based systems should be audited. On the other hand, accountability is a key requirement to be able to recourse [116] when an AI model contributes to making a proven wrong decision, issuing explanations and recommendations to cases that are unfavorably treated by such decision. Accountability is a matter of compliance with ethical and legal standards, answerability, reporting and oversight, and attribution and enforcement of consequences [117]. Therefore, when framed under AI regulatory standards and ethical principles like the ones discussed in this work, accountability becomes crucial for AI-based systems to distribute cost, risks, burdens and liabilities among the different stakeholders participating in its life cycle. HOW can this requirement be met in practice? Similarly to other requirements, we next analyze how the different dimensions spanned by this requirement can be tackled in practice. In doing so, Section 5.8.1 deals with accountability, whereas Section 5.8.2 addresses auditability. The minimization and reporting of negative impacts is discussed in Section 5.8.3. Finally, Section 5.8.4 describes methods for algorithmic redress. 5.8.1 Accountability Mechanisms of accountability are especially relevant in high-risk scenarios, as they assign responsibility for decisions in the design, development and deployment phases of the AI system. Tools to attain this requirement involve algorithmic accountability policy toolkits (e.g., [118]), the post-hoc analysis of the output of the model (e.g. via local relevance attribution methods) or algorithms for causal inference and reasoning [119]. Since accountability is linked to the principle of fairness, it is closely related to risk management since unfair adverse effects can occur. Therefore, risks must be identified and mitigated transparently so they can be explained to and verified by third parties. Therefore, techniques and tools for auditing data, algorithms and design processes are required for accountable decisions issued by AI-based systems. An overview on 16 risk assessment frameworks is available in [120], whereas built-in derisking processes at design and development phases can be found in [86,121]. These processes operationalize risk management in machine learning pipelines, including explainability and bias mitigation. Another set of resources to tackle bias and fairness are discussed in [86]. Emerging trade-offs between requirements should be stated and assessed with regards to the risk they pose to ethical requirements and compromise of fundamental rights, since no AI system should be used when no risk-free trade-off for these can be found [3]. Consequently, AI models useful for accountability often involve multi-criteria decision making and pipelines at the MLOps level that help delineate and inform such trade-offs to the user. 5.8.2 Auditability The AI Act has been interpreted as the European ecosystem to conduct AI auditing [122]. In the strict sense, the need for certifying systems that embed AI-based functionalities in their design is starting to permeate even within the international ISO standards for AI robustness. In such standards, formal methods for requirement verification or requirement satisfaction, typical of software engineering, are being extended towards verifying desirable properties of AI models. More specifically, in order to certify neural networks, properties such as stability, sensitivity, relevance or reachability are sought [110]. In terms of auditing procedures, especially when the AI system interacts with users, grading schemes adapted to the use case [123] are in need for validating models. Examples include the System Causability Scale [123] or the Muir Trust Scale [124], which are widely adopted in human robot interaction and robotics and rely on predictability (To what extent the robot behavior [the output of the AI-based system] can be predicted from moment to moment?), reliability (To what extent can you count on the system to do its job?), competence (What degree of faith does the user have on the system for it to cope with similar situations in the future?) and trust (How much does the user trust the system overall?). 5.8.3 Minimization and reporting of negative impacts and trade-offs The urgent need for developing stable and verifiable mechanisms for auditing AI-based systems becomes more relevant in the case of generative AI, which has grown so maturely that it is difficult to distinguish between human-created multimodal content and those generated by machines. If these are not properly identified, they can generate confusion and deception, which may have negative consequences for society, such as the manipulation of public opinion or the dissemination of fake news. A promising stream along these lines proposes to land the implementation of verifiable claims [125], which are defined as those falsifiable claims for which evidence and arguments can be provided to influence the probability that such claims are true. This proposal stems from the efforts of developers, regulators and other AI stakeholders, and the need to understand what properties of AI systems can be credibly demonstrated, through what means, and what trade-offs or commitments should and can be quantified. While the degree of certainty achievable varies across different claims and contexts, the idea is to demonstrate that greater degrees of evidence can be provided for claims about AI development than is typically done today to facilitate auditing them. 5.8.4 Redress Lastly, once the risk has turned into a confirmed incident, it is paramount that the user is aware of the possibility to redress, preserving his/her trust when adverse or unfair impact takes place [3]. Redress is related to the concept of algorithmic recourse [116], and consists of a procedure to correct or reverse an AI system outcome that is considered wrong. A key to trustworthy AI is ensuring adequate redress against decisions made by AI systems and by humans operating them through accessible mechanisms to their users when these fail, without forgetting vulnerable persons or collectives. Redress mechanisms are to be ensured, and complemented with accountability frameworks and disclaimers, since certification will obey particular application domains, and cannot replace responsibility. Machine unlearning [126], counterfactual explanations [127] or the analysis of disparate impacts [128] can be also regarded as techniques that can support redress in AI-based systems. 6 Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence from theory to practice and regulation: responsible Artificial Intelligence systems So far we have exposed the vision of trustworthy AI that has been tackled in most of the literature: from a theoretical point of view, and mainly based on principles and recommendations. In this section we highlight the importance of tackling trustworthy AI from a practical perspective. A clear mapping from trustworthy AI principles and requirements into operative protocols that can be automated, verified and audited does not always exist. To achieve this, the field needs blueprints and standard models to be adopted and standardized. In what follows we stress on the utmost importance of having practical regulatory scenarios (regulatory sandboxes) and the final output of processes implementing HRAIs using trustworthy AI: a responsible AI system. According to this idea, the section is organized as follows. First, Section 6.1 defines the nuanced yet necessary notion of responsible AI systems, to comply with both trustworthy AI requirements and the law in force. Then, Section 6.2 describes the technical requirements that the implementation of HRAIs will legally require in practice. Then, Section 6.3 presents how these requirements are going to be evaluated by regulators and auditors through regulatory sandboxes. Section 6.4 examines whether all these steps can be connected and applied through a blueprint proposal to implement trustworthy AI in healthcare. Finally, Section 6.5 examines the implications of new HRAIS and emerging AI systems, justifying the necessity of a dynamic regulation and flexible evaluation protocols to deal with new high-risk scenarios supported by these systems. 6.1 Responsible Artificial Intelligence systems A little prior to trustworthy AI is the term responsible AI, which has been widely used quite as a synonym. However, it is necessary to make an explicit statement on the similarities and differences that can be established between trustworthy and responsible AI. The main aspects that make such concepts differ from each other is that responsible AI emphasizes the ethical use of an AI-based system, its auditability, accountability, and liability. In general, when referring to responsibility over a certain task, the person in charge of the task assumes the consequences of his/her actions/decisions to undertake the task, whether they result to be eventually right or wrong. When translating this concept of responsibility to AI-based systems, decisions issued by the system in question must be accountable, legally compliant, and ethical. Other requirements for trustworthy AI reviewed in this manuscript (such as robustness or sustainability) are not relevant to responsibility. Therefore, trustworthy AI provides a broader umbrella that contains responsible AI and extends it towards considering other requirements that contribute to the generation of trust in the system. It is also worth mentioning that providing responsibility over AI products links to the provision of mechanisms for algorithmic auditing (auditability), which is part of requirement 7 (Accountability, Section 5.8). Stressing on the importance of a responsible development of AI, we now define the responsibility associated to AI systems, following the discussed features. Definition A Responsible AI system requires ensuring auditability and accountability during its design, development and use, according to specifications and the applicable regulation of the domain of practice in which the AI system is to be used. In the following we discuss in depth these features: 1. Auditability: As an element to aid accountability, a thorough auditing process aims to validate the conformity of the AI-based asset under target to (1) vertical or sectorial regulatory constraints; (2) horizontal or AI-wide regulations (e.g., EU AI Act); and (3) specifications and constraints imposed by the application for which it is designed. It is important to note that auditability refers to a property sought for the AI-based system, which may require transparency (e.g. explainability methods, traceability), measures to guarantee technical robustness, etc. This being said, the auditability of a responsible AI system may not necessarily cover all requirements for trustworthy AI, but rather those foretold by ethics, regulation, specifications and protocol testing adapted to the application sector (i.e., vertical regulation). 2. Accountability: which establishes the liability of decisions derived from the AI system\u2019s output, once its compliance with the regulations, guidelines and specifications imposed by the application for which it is designed has been audited. Again, accountability may comprise different levels of compliance with the requirements for trustworthy AI defined previously. In the context of the European approach and AI Act, this translates into a required pre-market use of regulatory sandboxes, and the adaptability of the requirements and regulation for trustworthy AI into a framework for the domain of practice of the AI system. 6.2 Artificial Intelligence systems\u2019 compliance with regulation in high-risk scenarios It has been concluded in the previous section that the conformity of requirements are central for the definition of responsible AI systems. In Europe, regulatory requirements in force for the deployment of AI-based systems are prescribed based on the risk of such systems to cause harm. Indeed, the AI Act agreed by the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission, is foreseen to set a landmark piece of legislation governing the use of AI in Europe and regulating this technology based on the definition of different levels of risks: minimal, limited and HRAIs. In these categories different requirements for trustworthy AI and levels of compliance are established, so that regulatory obligations are enforced therefrom. Furthermore, the European Commission has also asked the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to develop standards aimed to cover different practical aspects of AI systems, including foundational AI standards, data standards related to AI, Big Data and analytics, use cases and applications, governance implications of AI and computational approaches of AI. Ethical, societal concerns and AI trustworthiness also appear among the prioritized areas of these standardization bodies. Among these defined levels of risk associated to AI-based systems, those at the top of this classification (HRAIs) are subject to stringent obligations. HRAIs are demanded to comply with the AI Act through the fulfillment of the following seven requirements (AI Act, Chapter 2 [4]): 1. Adequate risk assessment and mitigation systems (Art. 9 - Risk management system). 2. High quality of the datasets feeding the system to minimize risks and discriminatory outcomes (Art. 10 - Data and data governance; Art. 9 - Risk management system). 3. Logging of activity to ensure traceability of results (Art. 12 - Record Keeping; 20 - Automatically generated logs). 4. Detailed documentation providing all information necessary on the system and its purpose for authorities to assess its compliance (Art. 11 - Technical documentation; Art. 12 - Record-keeping). 5. Clear and adequate information to the user (Art. 13 - Transparency). 6. Appropriate human oversight measures to minimize risk (Art. 14 - Human oversight). 7. High level of robustness, security and accuracy (Art. 15 - Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity). HRAIs must undergo conformity assessments before entering the EU market. One of the most complete guidance procedures assisting on complying with AI Act regulation is the CapAI procedure for conducting conformity assessment of AI systems [129]. It describes notions and metrics, checklists and other procedures to comply with the new legislation. Since the AI Act imposes obligations on providers, importers, distributors, and users, the latter can be deemed as providers in certain cases. For instance, if a user slightly modifies or uses a ready-made AI-based product such as ChatGPT for a different purpose, this makes him/her become responsible and accountable for the system\u2019s consequences, depending on the conditions that define HRAIs. This is why in order to realize trustworthy AI that is compliant with the law, we advocate for the development of responsible AI systems, i.e., systems that not only make a responsible implementation that fulfills the requirements for trustworthy AI, but also comply with the AI regulation. In practice, HRAIs providers must work to make their assets meet these requirements, including post-market monitoring plans [122] (AI Act Art. 61 - Post-market monitoring by providers and post-market monitoring plan for high-risk AI systems) to document the performance throughout the system\u2019s lifetime, in a way that vague concepts become verifiable criteria that strengthen the assessment safeguards and internal checks. Likewise, conformity assessments (AI Act, Art. 19 and Art. 43) will be ruled by internationally harmonized testing principles, guaranteeing high-quality testing. These tests can depart from ad-hoc procedures and protocols for the domain at hand. This is the case of the German standardization roadmap on AI [11], which proposes conformity assessments based on several steps: calibration, inspection, audit, validation and verification. This need for harmonized testing protocols, monitoring plans and conformity assessment procedures is the main reason for the emergence of the concept of AI regulatory sandboxes, which are next detailed and discussed. 6.3 Artificial Intelligence regulatory sandboxes: A challenge for auditing algorithms Once requirements for HRAIs have been established, the remaining challenge is to make the AI system comply with them appropriately. Such requisites (AI Act, Chapter 2, Art. 8\u201315) motivate the need for a test environment where to audit AI-based systems by safe and harmonized procedures established by the latter. Regulatory sandboxes are indeed recommended by the AI Act (Chapter 5, Art. 53\u201354). Concretely, the AI Act establishes that algorithms should comply with regulation and can be tested in a safe environment prior to entering the market. This auditing process can be implemented via regulatory sandboxes. In order to successfully undertake AI auditing processes under the new regulation, industry, academia and governmental actors are forced to adapt their processes and teams to comply with the law. Regulatory sandboxes act as test beds and safe playgrounds that allow assessing the compliance of AI systems with respect to regulation, risk mitigation strategies, conformity assessments, accountability and auditing processes established by the law. Fig. 4 illustrates the two stages where sandboxes play a crucial role: (i) pre-market auditability and conformity check, and (ii) post-market monitoring and accountability. The figure illustrates not only the different stakeholders participating in these two stages, but also the articles in the AI Act where each step within the process is described. In the current context of rapidly evolving AI products, sandboxes allow market stakeholders and business players to explore and experiment with new and innovative products, services or businesses under the supervision of a regulator. However, the idea of resorting to a sandbox to explore, evaluate and gauge complex technology is not new, nor exclusive of AI systems. They have already been used in other contexts to test and validate Fintech [130] or Blockchain 17 17 Launch of the European Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox. https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/launch-european-blockchain-regulatory-sandbox, accessed on April 25th, 2023. technologies in the European Union. The objective of these controlled environments is to test innovative technologies for a limited time, for innovators and regulators to cooperate. 18 18 First regulatory sandbox on Artificial Intelligence presented: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/first-regulatory-sandbox-artificial-intelligence-presented, accessed on June 07th, 2023. The AI Act also contains measures with the aim to reduce the regulatory burden on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and startups, prioritize them, and to reduce their time to market by ensuring legislation can be implemented in two years. The intended goal is to support innovation and small-scale providers, getting apart from the regulation stifling innovation critique. The benefits of sandboxes is that they support the development, testing and validation of innovative AI systems under the direct supervision and guidance of competent authorities (AI Act Art. 53). Furthermore, they allow experimenting by derogation (by putting aside certain rules or laws), and experimentation by devolution, which requires broad supra/national frameworks to establish guidelines that empower and help local governments to establish a regulation in a particular area. This enables differences among government levels by considering local preferences and needs as a means to stimulate innovative policies. When it comes to the challenges faced by sandboxes, there is a concern for the lack of proper methodological assessments that are indicative of the possible impact of AI on the society [131]. This concern fosters the need for cross-border and multi-jurisdictional regulatory sandbox standardization [132], as well as generic AI standardization [133]. Governments will have to find a balance between EU coordination and national procedures to avoid conflicts in the implementation of the regulation [134]. Specifically in the AI Act (Art. 53), participants in the sandbox remain liable under applicable liability legislation. Eligibility criteria and participants obligations and rights is to be set up in implementing acts. Derived from the above challenge, we note that sandboxes are still far from maturity. This leads to two main aspects that remain unresolved: (1) the design of sandboxes with guidelines that rapidly and effectively permit algorithmic auditing; and (2) the development of intelligent systems for high-risk scenarios that are validated through the necessary auditing processes. Important efforts are currently driven towards addressing these aspects as two additional fundamental challenges. At European level, Spain is leading a pilot to set up a regulatory sandbox according to the European AI Act legislation. Together with sandboxes to work in practice, additional future mechanisms will include the certification or quality control within a regulatory framework. In this sense, Spain is starting to develop a national seal of quality to certify the security and quality of AI technology used in Spain. In cooperation with industry, they will set up the technical criteria for companies to obtain this seal, and develop tools to facilitate the certification process, e.g., developing self-assessment software. Several companies will be open the possibility to grant the seal, which will be voluntary for AI companies to obtain. At the international level, one effort towards this end is the IEEE CertifAIEd program 19 19 IEEE CertifAIEd: https://engagestandards.ieee.org/ieeecertifaied.html, accessed on June 6th, 2023. to assess ethics of Autonomous Intelligent Systems via certification guidance, assessment and independent verification. This mark is meant for IEEE authorized assessors and certifiers to perform an independent review and verification to grant a mark and certificate based on ontological specifications for Ethical Privacy, Algorithmic Bias, Transparency, and Accountability. We expect that the first experiences and results of running regulatory sandboxes and their alignment with certification activities will permit to learn lessons, to improve AI systems and eventually, to support the progressive proliferation of responsible AI systems deployed in practical scenarios. We believe that sandbox assessment should be periodically performed by independent and impartial assessment bodies to certificate and audit AI systems during their lifetime. 6.4 Practical case study in Artificial Intelligence for healthcare At the time of writing (April 2023), the AI Act regulation draft is constantly being updated through different amendments, due in part to new versions of AI products accessible to the general public. Concerned with how essential is the translation of principles and regulation into specific processes, it becomes necessary to have blueprint models and protocols that serve to assess how trustworthy AI systems are. The blueprint for Trustworthy AI Implementation Guidance and Assurance for Healthcare is one step taken in this direction. Fig. 5 shows the proposal by the coalition for health AI [135], based on collaboration, guiding principles and leadership actions. It is aligned with the AI risk management framework from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In particular, to ensure trustworthiness this framework describes four key functions [135]: \u2022 Mapping the framing AI risks, \u2022 Measuring quantitatively and qualitatively these risks and impacts, \u2022 Managing the allocation of risk resources, and a cross-cutting, \u2022 Governance via risk management. Based on these functions, they define values to set the key elements of trustworthy AI in healthcare [135]: 1. Useful: valid and reliable, testable, usable and beneficial. These values are closely linked to social wellbeing (Requirement 6, Section 5.7) and auditability (Requirement 7, Section 5.8). 2. Safe, which is related to technical robustness and safety (Requirement 2, Section 5.3). 3. Accountable and transparent, with clear connections to accountability (Requirement 7, Section 5.8) and transparency (Requirement 4, Section 5.5). 4. Explainable and interpretable, echoing several dimensions of the transparency requirement. 5. Fair with harmful bias managed (systemic bias, computational and statistical biases and human-cognitive biases). The consideration of fairness and the focus on the management of consequences of harmful biases are present in requirement 5 (Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness, Section 5.6), particularly in the avoidance of unfair biases. Furthermore, requirement 7 (accountability, Section 5.8) also regards the minimization of negative impacts, either due to harmful biases or to other consequences. 6. Secure and resilient, which relate to the dimension of traceability (requirement 4, Section 5.5) and technical robustness (Requirement 2, Section 5.3). 7. Privacy-enhanced, which is coupled with requirement 3 \u2014 Privacy and data governance (Section 5.4). It is important to underscore that some dimensions of the requirements for trustworthy AI discussed in Section 5 are not reflected (at least, explicitly) in the above list of values, e.g. environmental wellbeing or reproducibility. This resounds with our formulated definition of a responsible AI system, showing that a system as such, depending on its domain of application, may require different degrees of compliance with the requirements for trustworthiness. The blueprint analyzed in [135] recognizes the difficulties on building ecosystems when multiple guidelines are left out in the wild without a standardization consensus. It calls for mapping socio-technical scenarios to resolve tensions among principles, an ISO-based approach to professional responsibility, and institutionalizing trustworthy AI Systems (that is, responsible AI systems). As a follow-up of the blueprint, the coalition for health AI [135] suggests: \u2022 Setting up an engaged assurance lab and advisory service independent infrastructure. \u2022 Institutionalizing trustworthy AI systems (responsible AI systems). \u2022 Promoting a Coalition of the Willing through interesting strategies that can be applied in health AI to drive a positive change. Other practical frameworks exist. They count with strategies to implement ethics and the governance of AI systems in health to separate the factors affecting trustworthy medical AI into design (data and algorithm aspects) and application. This is done through controls strategies [136] at both design and application phases. First, the ethical governance system departs from social needs and ethical values, which lead to ethical principles to be enforced at the research stage. After that, those principles guide the ethical norms that allow performing risk assessment, and later make the law and regulation concrete. In particular, the framework in [137] aims at avoiding situations that can have dire consequences for patients. For instance, integrating the applied ethics Z-Inspection\u00ae [138] process to map and assess tensions in socio-technical scenarios in trustworthy AI. Another proposal [139] formulates ten commandments (i.e., high-level ethical principles) that should be met by medical AI-based systems. Such commandments are formulated without the theoretical aspects underneath for the sake of an easier understanding and verification of all stakeholders involved in this domain. European fundamental rights also provide legal and ethical guidelines for the adoption, development and application of medical AI [140]. These strategies and the blueprint are advancing the research in the area, and results will be extensible to other domains to attain trustworthy AI. Despite the clear establishment of the seven requirements for HRAIs within the AI Act described in Section 6.2, the particular implementation steps to be taken within a particular area of application often remain under-specified. It becomes evident that the AI-based system is stringently dependent on the sector of application, as well as on the coupling of the requirements for trustworthy AI to justify existing regulations and standards. Therefore, for a given domain of practice, an overarching consideration of the complete scenario is needed from the Trustworthy AI practical point of view. The field needs to further specify legal requirements, risk assessment tools for the ethical impact of the AI system, data privacy and data governance models, ad-hoc risk management systems and conformity assessments, and rest of essential elements evaluated in the regulatory sandboxes testing the scenario. This may also spur the emergence of generic trustworthy AI frameworks (regulatory sandboxes) that can be potentially adapted to different domains, as it is discussed in [141]. 6.5 Urgent needs for emerging AI systems, dynamic regulation, and evaluation protocols The widespread use and repercussion of the achievements of emerging AI systems, such as GPAIS or neuroscience technology, have brought to the public arena the potentials and implications of new high-risk scenarios supported by these technological advances. In this section we discuss potential issues to be tackled to regulate new HRAIs as well as future emerging AI systems. We discuss and argue that regulation should be dynamic and malleable to establish the boundaries of new high-risk scenarios supported by technological AI advances. Likewise, we also highlight the need for flexible evaluation procedures that can be adapted in an agile way to cope with the fast evolution of AI systems. Indeed, the rapid pace at which AI evolves over time can unexpectedly give rise to new high-risk scenarios beyond those defined by regulation, such as the AI Act (Section 6.2). This requires regulatory protocols to cope with new emerging applications. In the case of the European AI Act, on 11th May 2023, MEPs endorsed new transparency and risk-management rules for AI systems. 20 20 AI Act: a step closer to the first rules on Artificial Intelligence, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230505IPR84904/ai-act-a-step-closer-to-the-first-rules-on-artificial-intelligence, accessed on June 6th, 2023. MEPs expanded the classification of high-risk areas to include those that could compromise or harm people\u2019s health, safety, fundamental rights or the environment. Such revised classification of high-risk scenarios also considered AI systems used to influence voters in political campaigns, as well as recommender systems (with more than 45 million users) utilized by social media platforms. Intrusive and discriminatory uses of AI-based biometric systems have been also identified as prohibited AI systems, such as: \u2022 \u201cReal-time\u201d remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces; \u2022 \u201cPost\u201d remote biometric identification systems, with the only exception of law enforcement for the prosecution of serious crimes and only after judicial authorization; \u2022 Biometric categorization systems using sensitive characteristics (e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship status, religion, political orientation); \u2022 Predictive policing systems (based on profiling, location or past criminal behavior); \u2022 Emotion recognition systems in law enforcement, border management, workplace, and educational institutions; and \u2022 Indiscriminate scraping of biometric data from social media or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases (violating human rights and right to privacy). In this revision of the AI Act, MEPs have also proposed tailored regulatory regimes for new and fast-evolving developments in the field of AI and GPAIS. Since GPAIS are systems that have a wide range of possible uses without substantial modification and fine-tuning, generative foundation models are examples of rapidly evolving areas for which, if regulation is not set in place, consequences may be hard to revert. Such systems must guarantee robust the protection of fundamental rights, health and safety and the environment, democracy and rule of law. To this end, such emerging AI systems must assess and mitigate risks, comply with design, information and environmental requirements, and be registered in the EU database. Furthermore, additional transparency requirements have been demanded for generative foundation models such as GPT: they must inform that the content is generated by an AI model, the model must be designed to avoid generating illegal content and publishing summaries or copyrighted content used during training. Jurisdiction at national level will also need to be adapted to different considerations demanded by different sectors, e.g., the public sector or labor sector. Another area in which regulation and technology yet have to advance is in copyright management of generated artwork produced by foundation models. Although the AI Act requires to disclose the use of copyrighted material in the training data, there is no current way to detect when AI generated content may be directly related to existing content protected by copyright, nor it is clear who owns the intellectual property of generative models outputs [142,143]. Besides GPAIS, other emerging AI-based technologies also require specialized adjustments of ongoing regulatory efforts. This is the case of neurotechnology, such as brain interfaces. The needs to handle novel applications never used before become evident by recent research [144] that shows the potential of \u201cmind-reading\u201d [145]. For instance, the study in [144] shows the potential of leveraging language models as an autoregressive prior to generate novel sequences that can decode structured sequential information in the form of text from brain signals. Although the study of human imagination decoding shows human cooperation is required for the approach to work, this may not be a requisite in the future. Even if decoding is not accurate yet, these systems could be used maliciously. These recent results attained by neurotechnology call for raising awareness about the risks posed by brain decoding technology, and for the design of regulation and policies to preserve fundamental rights such as mental privacy. A role model in this direction is the novel neurorights regulation pioneered by Chile. 21 21 NeuroRights Foundation, https://neurorightsfoundation.org/, accessed on June 06th, 2023., which has taken a step towards the first Neurorights law in this country. Their neuroprotection agenda (which is closely followed up by Spain) leads the way to the regulation of brain technology and legislation of advances in AI-supported medicine and science from a human rights\u2019 point of view. This is of utmost importance to avoid mental manipulation, as mental diseases are the grand pandemic of XXI century. If used appropriately, AI based technology applied to the diagnosis and treatment of mental diseases has a great potential to improve patients\u2019 quality of life. In order for regulation to evolve synchronously with technological advances (and vice versa), evaluation procedures must be flexible and dynamically adaptable to accommodate the implications of these advances over time. More comprehensive evaluation tools are required to be adopted by the AI community of practitioners and users if we aspire to synergistic solutions that can complement governmental efforts. In particular, ML and AI model evaluation is normally based on leader-board benchmarks that do not always reflect reality, and may have a detrimental effect when they are not faithful to reality. A more accountable evaluation should consider aggregated metrics. Improperly constructed benchmarks may, for instance, reflect unrealistic overestimation of the capabilities of a model when predicting over minority classes. This may lead to hazards that end up obfuscating the real benefits of AI. To avoid these issues, important guidelines for robust evaluation practices [146] include: 1. Granular performance reporting protocols with breakdowns across the features that have demonstrated affecting performance. 2. Designing benchmarks to test capabilities and to significantly vary on important features of the problem space and labeling instances to allow for granular analyses (e.g. as the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models benchmark [147]). 3. Record all results, successful or failing, partial or fully traced, in supplementary material or public repositories for each run and validation split separately (e.g., in medical AI [148]). 4. Enable researchers follow-up instance-level analyses by including data labels and annotations of those instances. However, prospective evaluation methodologies as the one described above should be versatile and extensible to embrace and incorporate new performance metrics, evaluation protocols or even modeling tasks proposed along the years. But most importantly: their sought flexibility should not give rise to exceptional cases that would undermine the validity and applicability of regulations in force. We conclude that given the fast pace at which AI is progressing in the last months, it is of paramount importance to have a dynamic regulation from a double perspective: the appearance of risk-based scenarios and the emergence of novel AI systems. Only in this way the regulation will facilitate the realization of responsible AI systems, in parallel to the development of methodologies for algorithmic auditing and the clearance of responsibilities in the use of such systems. 7 From the Artificial Intelligence moratorium letter to regulation as the key for consensus At the time of writing, a global debate is held around the moratorium letter published by several renowned researchers calling for a pause in large AI experimentation. 22 22 Future of Life Institute, Pause giant AI experiments: An open letter, https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/, accessed on April 25th, 2023. The letter can be interpreted as a contribution to pointing out the gap between the fast advance of high-powered AI systems and the regulation. The letter also highlights that: \u201cAI research and development should be refocused on making today\u2019s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal\u201d. Following up this moratorium letter, several declarations and written statements by reputed experts have been published to approach the AI conundrum between ethics, regulation and technological progress from different perspectives. Among them, we highlight the interview with G. Hinton, 23 23 Geoffrey Hinton: \u201cWe need to find a way to control artificial intelligence before it\u2019s too late\u201d, https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-05-12/geoffrey-hinton-we-need-to-find-a-way-to-control-artificial-intelligence-before-its-too-late.html, accessed on June 4th, 2023. in which he states that \u201cWe need to find a way to control artificial intelligence before it\u2019s too late\u201d. Interestingly under the scope of this work, he has also underscored the different nature of intelligent systems when compared to human intelligence, and thereby the need for establishing regulation for these artificial systems: \u201cOur brains are the result of evolution and have a series of integrated goals \u2014 such as not hurting the body, hence the notion of damage; eating enough, hence the notion of hunger. Making as many copies of ourselves as possible, hence the sexual desire. Synthetic intelligence, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t evolved: we\u2019ve built it. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t necessarily come with innate goals. So, the big question is, can we make sure that AI has goals that benefit us? This is the so-called alignment problem. And we have several reasons to be very concerned\u201d. A similar line of thinking has been expressed by Harari, 24 24 Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI has hacked the operating system of human civilization, https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/04/28/yuval-noah-harari-argues-that-ai-has-hacked-the-operating-system-of-human-civilisation, accessed on June 4th, 2023. emphasizing on the pressing immediacy at which regulation is needed to match the speed of AI technological development with the public use of AI systems: \u201cWe can still regulate the new AI tools, but we must act quickly. Whereas nukes cannot invent more powerful nukes, AI can make exponentially more powerful AI. The first crucial step is to demand rigorous safety checks before powerful AI tools are released into the public domain. Just as a pharmaceutical company cannot release new drugs before testing both their short-term and long-term side-effects, so tech companies shouldn\u2019t release new AI tools before they are made safe. We need an equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration for new technology, and we need it yesterday\u201d. Another example is the proposal made by Sam Altman (OpenAI co-founder) before the US Senate to defend the benefits of this revolutionary technology, claiming that AI regulation should ensure that the public has access to its many advantages 25 25 Written Testimony of Sam Altman Chief Executive Officer OpenAI, https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/0668f6f4-d957-4b94-a745-2aa9617d1d60.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_18, accessed on June 4th, 2023. : \u201c[...] we are not alone in developing this technology. It will be important for policymakers to consider how to implement licensing regulations on a global scale and ensure international cooperation on AI safety, including examining potential intergovernmental oversight mechanisms and standard-setting\u201d. Finally, the manifesto on AI risk supported by multiple scientists and notable figures in the AI landscape has claimed to elevate the mitigation of AI risks to the priority levels of other humanity-threatening fatalities 26 26 Statement on AI Risk, https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk, accessed on June 04th, 2023. : \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\u201d. The controversy held around these and other statements is whether humanity is close to or far from the moment at which AI can pose a realistic threat to its own existence. Unquestionably, triggering this debate has ignited even further the need for ethical and regulatory frameworks that regulate whether and how AI-based systems can be trusted and used in practical setups. After this latter manifesto, the Center for AI Safety has just published a new document entitled Existing policy proposals aimed at present and future harms\u2019. 27 27 Existing Policy Proposals Targeting Present and Future Harms, https://https://www.safe.ai/post/three-policy-proposals-for-ai-safety, accessed on June 07th, 2023. The aim of this one-page document is to describe three proposals that, in our view, promote AI safety. We follow with a short analysis of these proposals: \u2022 Legal Liability for AI harms: The first issue highlighted in the document is the need for establishing improved legal liability frameworks for the accountability of damages caused by the application of AI systems. GPAIS are also referred in the document for the ill-advised implementation of legal exemptions to absolve GPAIS developers of liability, as such exemptions could unfairly shift the entire burden of responsibility from large corporations to smaller actors, users and communities lacking the necessary resources, access, and capabilities to effectively address and alleviate all risks. \u2022 Increased regulatory scrutiny: The second problem emphasized in this document is the need for a greater regulatory inspection during the development of AI systems, extending beyond the application layer to encompass the entire product lifecycle. It underscores the importance of holding companies responsible for the data and design choices they make when developing these models. In line with this proposal, increased transparency and regulations over training data are crucial to address algorithmic bias effectively, and to prevent companies from unfairly leveraging copyrighted materials through data modeling without compensating their creators. \u2022 Human supervision of automated systems: The third theme in the document is the importance of human oversight in the implementation of HRAIs. Human oversight can contribute to lessening potential concerns with bias and the propagation of false or misleading information through AI systems. An explicit reference is done to the EU\u2019s regulatory proposal, with a positive emphasis on the importance therein granted to the human oversight in the deployment of HRAIs. Our position, as we put it in this manuscript, is that \u201cregulation is a key for consensus\u201d among these diverging voices to cast light over the shadows of modern AI technologies. For this to occur, technologies, methodologies and tools supporting the development, auditability and accountability of responsible AI systems are of utmost importance to cope with high-risk scenarios and to meet regulatory constraints. To finish this section, we pay attention to a final point made by the authors of the paper [15]. Unfortunately, this road towards consensus is not exempt of their own risks. Indeed, conflating trust and trustworthiness with the acceptability of risks blurs the distinction between acceptability judgments made by domain experts and the trustworthiness of AI systems implemented in society [15]. It has been argued that trust is improbable to be produced on demand and impossible on command, as \u201ctrust engineering\u201d may backfire and not achieve its goal. Focused on trust and trustworthiness in AI in the public sector, [15] argues on the four acute challenges facing the European Commission\u2019s attempt to signal the trustworthiness of AI through its proposed regulation: the uncertainty about the antecedents of perceived trust in public institutions that utilize AI; the threat of misalignment between trustworthiness and degrees of trust; concealed behavioral factors behind the acceptability of risks; and the need for impartial intermediaries. Despite these and other curves in the road, regulation can be an unquestionable driving force to consolidate and put all these diverging voices on the same page. Regulation has favored consensus about the benefits and restrictions of technological advances that have evolved faster than expected, permeating quickly into the society (e.g., social networks, Internet or mobile communications). AI should not be an exception. There is still a long way to go before we have fully aligned AI technology and regulation, developing responsible AI systems adapted to each risk scenario and fully leveraging the latest advances in the field. For this to occur, the European regulatory model based on risk-based use case scenarios can serve as a guiding light for the maturity and implementation of ethical, legal and technical frameworks, fostering the creation of industrial and institutional instruments (e.g. AI sandboxes or AI ethics board [149]) that guarantee that AI-based products and services comply with their requirements. 8 Concluding remarks For years now, the ever-growing capabilities of AI-powered systems have stimulated debates about the impact, benefits, implications and risks brought by AI systems to the industry and society. The ground-breaking potential of large generative AI models such as ChatGPT and GPT4 has reinvigorated this debate, since their near general-purpose capabilities learned from multimodal data can support a wide variety of intended and unintended purposes and tasks, by generating content that is hardly distinguishable from that made by humans. This notorious advance has reinvigorated the relevance and momentum of trustworthy AI systems, particularly in what refers to (1) the ethical usage of these models, and (2) the need for regulatory directives that establish what, when and how AI systems can be adopted in practical applications. In this context, this manuscript has shed light on the principles, pillars and requirements to be met by trustworthy AI systems to be considered as such. To this end, we have departed from mature regulation/supervisory frameworks developed around trustworthy AI (e.g. AI Act) to provide clear definitions of all related concepts, placing emphasis on what each requirement for trustworthiness in AI stands for, why they contribute to generating trust in the user of an AI-based system, and how such requirements can be met technically. Regarding the latter, a short tour over technological areas that can contribute to each of these requirements has been offered. Our study has also overviewed ethical principles for the development of AI, which establish an overarching set of recommendations that ensure that this discipline will be advanced under social and ethical standards. The study has been complemented by a discussion on practical aspects to be considered in the design, development and use of trustworthy AI systems, stressing on the importance of assessing their conformity to regulations (auditability) and explaining how their decisions are issued (accountability). These two practical aspects must be met by responsible AI systems. Further along this line, accountability and explainability have permeated deeply into the recommendations recently issued for the development of trustworthy medical AI, a risk-critical sector in large demand for trust when embracing new technological advances. Our analysis of such recommendations has exposed that auditability and accountability are at the core of the guidelines proposed in this area; together with ethics, data governance and transparency. Medical AI exemplifies the paramount relevance of considering all these requirements for trustworthiness along the entire AI cycle. In summary, we hope that this paper serves as a reference for researchers, practitioners and neophytes who are new to the world of AI, with interest in trustworthy AI from a holistic perspective. A well-rounded analysis of what trust means in AI-based systems and its requirements as the one offered in this manuscript is a key for the design and development of responsible AI systems throughout their life cycle. We should not regulate scientific progress, but rather products and its usage. As we emphasize in this paper, regulation is the key for consensus, and for this purpose, trustworthy AI and responsible AI systems for high risk scenarios are imperative, as they will contribute to the convergence between technology and regulation, the advance of science, the prosperity of our economies, and the good of humanity, subject to legal requirements and ethical principles.

We investigate time-varying network interlinkages between artificial intelligence development and green energy market dynamics during the War in a Pandemic. While regarding AI development, we use First Trust NASDAQ Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF, Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence and ishares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, and the green energy market, including green bonds, clean energy, wind energy, solar energy, natural gas, and crude oil using seven Bayesian vector heterogeneous autoregression fashions. During the short, medium, and long run, this paper differentiates dynamically between network interlinkages between these markets. We found some noteworthy results in our study. We show that network interlinkages exhibit remarkable differences over time. Interlinkages between networks are increased in the short, medium, and long term due to transient events occurring in markets during the studied period. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the long-term ties within the system are significantly impacted. Additionally, based on net directional linkages, market directional links indicate a shift in roles (from shock receiver to shock transmitter) during the epidemic and at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Observations of short- and medium-term trends reveal that all three indexes for artificial intelligence development are shock receivers from outside, which is transmitted to the green energy sector. The results indicate that artificial intelligence development persists as shock receivers in terms of long-horizon measures but become shocking transmitters during the illness crisis of COVID-19 (from January 2019 to January 2020) and the Russia-Ukraine conflict (from early 2022).

The majority of the energy sector is changing as a result of digital technologies, which include devices, systems, electronic tools, and resources capable of generating, storing, or processing data (Alekseev et al., 2019; Babina et al., 2022). The trend of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud computing, and Robotics adoption has increased and is expected to have multi-dimensional effects on the economy. It is estimated that AI, Blockchain technology, Big Data, IoT, Cloud computing, and Robotics are among the most broadly applied emerging digital technologies. Although there have been some advances in digital technology in the energy industry, it remains unclear which one is the most important. Our study explores a critical research question in particular: How does artificial intelligence development influence the renewable or green energy market dynamics? A number of quickly developing technologies are considered to be part of artificial intelligence (Ahmad et al., 2021; Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2012). There does not appear to be a definite meaning for artificial intelligence. This is given the complexities of intelligence and the variety of ways in which it is used across different seemingly unrelated fields (Lyu and Liu, 2021). In light of the fact that artificial intelligence research has not reached maturity, it is understandable that there is currently no consensus on the topic (Russell et al., 2010). In the first instance, because of the shortage of a definable definition of artificial intelligence, policymakers have difficulty evaluating different AI systems and adopting regulations and policies to address them. In addition, AI's lack of agreement adversely impacts the community of artificial intelligence as a whole, resulting in communication and cooperation challenges among diverse groups, and thereby resulting in a shortage of the development of benchmark tests, evaluation criteria, milestones, and the factors that are necessary for the successful development of AI communities. Aside from AI, other new technologies, namely cloud computing, robots, blockchain technology, IoT, and big data, are also rapidly becoming mainstream and transforming the energy industry. By reviewing a digital technologies adoption that compares the rate at which new digital technologies are used in the energy sector in the U.S, we indicate that AI technology has also been shown to be the most popular use of new development technologies, requiring about 7 percent of the jobs posted on the internet. Also, we find AI's significant impacts on the energy industry. There is a generally negative outlook on the effect of the adoption of digital and AI technologies reported previously (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020; Babina et al., 2022; Yoo et al., 2012). As an example, some literature has demonstrated that the increasing prevalence of AI has led to the displacement of workers, leading to unemployment, poor wages, and a rise in inequality as a result of the polarization in labor markets (Agrawal et al., 2019). In light of the trend toward the adoption of robotics, some authors are concerned that an unstable society will result due to the replacement of workers by robotics. Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, as well as other emerging digital technologies, are expected to drive down industry wages and squeeze out laborers due to the adoption of low-cost workers. The human workforce will eventually be replaced by these technologies (Athey et al., 2020). As well as these advances in digital technology, nevertheless, there is an agreement that they will improve efficiency and productivity within the energy sector as well as provide a more secure environment for workers (Autor, 2015; Autor et al., 2003). It is not ideal to have an easy adoption process for emerging digital technologies due to the ongoing debate related to their advantages and costs (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2012). Using data from the BGT with Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) wage data to determine if new digital technologies are beneficial or harmful to energy companies and employees, OES wage data were compared to BGT wage data. The level of wages is also examined in the focal firm, according to job postings associated with emerging digital technologies. Taking advantage of the new digital technologies that are emerging raises the average wage of the company adopting it. Additionally, new digital technologies adoption has contributed to a growth in wage classes in the local workforce market. Similarly, Compustat's firm performance data was similar to BGT's data. Particularly, artificial intelligence has a very significant impact on determining the wages grade on the local labor market, as well as energy firms' performance and average wage. The results of our research indicate that emerging digital technologies not only pose no adverse effects on the adopting firm but are also advantageous to the local labor market as well. International investors are constantly keen to make investments. Investors are attracted to the market due to its combination of high growth and weak efficiency (Jena et al., 2020). There has been little research on technology-based non-traditional assets that can be exploited as diversification options in the development of financial economies. Notably, Digital technology's impact and FinTech innovations application to various aspects of the economy have not been fully explored. Especially the dynamic interconnectedness between digital technology and FinTech innovations adoption and green energy dynamic has still been kept silent in the literature thus far. In addition to displaying the most robust asset during the pre-and post-outbreak phases of COVID-19 as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the present study is unique due to the lack of materials on diversification potential with non-traditional asset classes. Huynh et al. (2020) and Le et al. (2021) conducted three important research papers on digital assets when put with old types of assets. Based on our knowledge, Le et al. (2021)\u2019s study is most outstanding in examining the effect of COVID-19 on digital assets compared to other asset groups. Furthermore, neither study has focused solely on tech-based commodities such as FinTech, AI, Robots, as well as Blockchain while engaging in the green and environmental energy market. The research used cutting-edge digital investments that are catching the businesses that are widely participating in FinTech innovations. First Trust NASDAQ artificial intelligence and robotics ETF (ROBT), global X robotics and artificial intelligence (BOTZ), and iShares robotics and artificial intelligence (IRBO) are the two funds being considered in the study. The study provides insight into the effects of the pandemic as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict for the first time. In order to achieve this purpose, our research will cover the time period spanning from May 01, 2019, to October 28, 2022. Evaluation of spillover utilizing a network of connectedness between FinTech innovations and green energy dynamics during turbulent times based on the use of the Bayesian vector heterogeneous autoregressive (BVHAR) models. An analysis has been conducted to compare fluctuations and ships in their role in diverse times. This paper contributes to the literature in at least four different ways. First, as we highlighted previously, we are the first to examine the link between the development of artificial intelligence and the green and renewable energy market. Second, to better understand volatility interlinkages among various kinds of markets, a methodology for analyzing these interlinkages was developed in this study. Third, our paper focuses on the interaction between volatility arising from green energy and AI development after some events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the war between Ukraine and Russia. Lastly, our study provides a daily dataset for AI development. An analysis of the volatility of the energy sector is based on Green Bonds (SPGB), Clean Energy (SPGTCLEN), Wind Energy (GWE), Solar Energy (SUNIDX), Natural Gas (NGF), and Crude Oil. This time series covers the period from May 01, 2019, to October 28, 2022. We compile the S&P Green Bond Index (SPGB), which is a market-weighted index consisting of green bonds from the energy sector around the globe. Solar energy companies worldwide are measured by the Macerich Company Global Solar Energy Index Net Total Return (SUNIDX). In addition, we also have S&P Global Clean Energy Index (SPGTCLEN). The ISE Global Wind Energy Index (GWE) measures the performance of public companies in the wind power industry based on an analysis of their products and services. A Natural Gas Futures contract (NGF) requires the buyer to purchase a specific amount of natural gas. On the delivery of international natural gas businesses, NGF is based. On the delivery of international natural gas businesses, NGF is based. Crude oil volatility is measured by the CBOE volatility index (OVX) for the next 30 days for the crude oil ETF. Using this database, we comprehensively analyze the link between global uncertainty and the volatilities arising from green markets. Following is a brief overview of the remainder of the paper. Section 2 contains a detailed overview of artificial intelligence and its impacts on the green energy market. The empirical approaches in the study are shown in Section 3. Section 4 reports the critical findings. Section 5 provides conclusions and policy recommendations. 2 Literature review 2.1 The emerging digital technologies in the energy sector The energy industry is undergoing a transformation as a result of digitization (Matt et al., 2015; Price et al., 2013). Emerging digital technologies have transformed the energy industry into an era of Energy 4.0, with the wide adoption of digital devices and machines at every level of the power system (Socconini and Mart\u00edn, 2019). Achieving sustainable and decarbonization of energy resources requires intelligent energy management throughout every phase of the power system, including end-user devices, infrastructure, and production (Cronin et al., 2018). Artificial intelligence is one of the digital technologies that is growing in popularity and being adopted by the energy industry (Bedi and Toshniwal, 2019). Artificial intelligence has the characteristic of being able to be applied to a wide variety of energy-related tasks, for example, forecasting energy demand, generating and utilizing energy efficiently, forecasting energy prices, and integrating renewable energy sources. In addition to accelerating the implementation of smart buildings implementation, grids, and cities, the widespread use of AI in the sector of energy is also accelerating the adoption of smart grids (Behm et al., 2020; Le et al., 2021). The purpose of this article is to give a broad understanding of intelligence as \"the collection of a wide range of technologies and methods used to carry out tasks related to the human brain, and in particular, those related to learning and solving problems\" (Russell et al., 2010). Since this definition provides a comprehensive overview of modern technologies, for example, natural language processing, data mining, neural networks, computer vision, algorithms, etc., it has gained widespread acceptance. The artificial intelligence discussed in this paper, however, is confined to limited AI rather than general AI (Dunis et al., 2016) and weak AI rather than powerful (Russell et al., 2010). In the case of a powerful or general artificial intelligence, machines would be capable of not only imitating the nature of the human brain but also thinking for themselves or even being self-aware. However, that is beyond the scope of this paper. The IoT is an upcoming technology that involves connected computing devices, as well as digital and mechanical machines (Ferrari et al., 2022; Hossein Motlagh et al., 2020). A significant goal of the IoT is to provide interconnection between physical objects, including industrial machinery and household appliances, as well as to provide valuable data, resulting in a wide range of services for users (Motlagh et al., 2020). Because of its inherent \"connectivity,\" IoT is broadly adopted throughout all aspects of the energy industry, such as construction, environmental monitoring, logistics, manufacturing, and so on. The Internet of Things can reduce costs, decrease downtime, and enhance profitability in the energy industry, thereby promoting energy efficiency. In addition to its application for raising the proportion of renewable energy and decreasing the effect of energy consumption on the environment, the Internet of Things is becoming increasingly prevalent (Rissman et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2016). Besides, IoT is also increasingly being used in smart homes and in so-called \"smart objects\", which are particularly useful to the elderly and people with disabilities. A significant benefit of the IoT revolution has been the energy industry, which has the highest asset intensity in the economy (Tao et al., 2016). A significant aspect of robotics is the operation, use of robots, design, and construction, which is an interdisciplinary field of computer science and engineering. In the production process, manufacturing, and design of a range of equipment for the energy industry, such as solar panels and wind turbines, robotics plays an increasingly important part (Chen et al., 2018). As nuclear, biological, solar, hydropower, and wind all utilize robots and automation to some extent, automation and robots are becoming increasingly common in the renewable energy sector (Andersson et al., 2022; Bloess et al., 2018). Due to its multi-disciplinary, repeatable, reliable, and precise nature, robotics is well suited for performing inspections and maintenance of energy systems across a wide range of disciplines. Consequently, robots are being increasingly incorporated into the energy sector in an effort to decrease set-up times and costs while improving quality and productivity. In the era of artificial intelligence and other new digital technologies, big data forms the basis. The term \"big data\" refers primarily to massive datasets that can be examined computationally to uncover associations, trends, and patterns that can be used to extract valuable information on a systematic basis (Sestino et al., 2020). Organizational databases that contain structured data can be classified as \"Big Data\" while unstructured data, such as data generated by the Internet of Things devices, including images, audio, and video, can be classified as \"unstructured data\". The size and complexity of Big Data make it impossible to process and analyze it using traditional software for data processing (Allam and Dhunny, 2019; Chiang et al., 2017). This can be achieved by combining cloud computing with artificial intelligence algorithms to provide solutions for analyzing Big Data. It has been observed that energy companies are also more extensively utilizing Internet of Things sensor technology and Big Data analytics to benefit from their operations. As a result, the energy industry has adopted Big Data analytics to improve power planning and generation (Espinoza and Aronczyk, 2021; Ma and Cheng, 2016). Having the ability to store digital transactions in a secure manner due to its allocated data structures, blockchain technology, most commonly used in cryptocurrency applications, has been gaining popularity in the energy sector for a variety of key applications. An automated, shared, and distributed database containing a continuous record chronologically ordering transactions is known as a blockchain (Andoni et al., 2019). Digital transactions can be aggregated into larger formations by blockchain technology. As each block is time-stamped and cryptographically related to the block before it, a chain of records can be formed to establish the chronological order of events. This process is known as the \u201cblockchain\u201d (Foti and Vavalis, 2019). Blockchain technology is becoming increasingly widespread among energy companies as a result of the current trend of decentralization in the energy industry, particularly in peer-to-peer markets (P2P) (Berka and Dreyfus, 2021). Small generation and consumption units of electricity can be integrated with the intelligent grid using Blockchain, offering transparency to consumers and offering energy suppliers new business models, for example. In addition, Blockchain can speed up the implementation of digital applications and IoT platforms to enhance the effectiveness of energy production practices. Energy companies are increasingly relying on cloud computing to process large volumes of data that are generated in the energy sector, as opposed to traditional office-based computing methods (Beach et al., 2013; Rajeev and Ashok, 2015). As defined in this paper, cloud computing refers to the provision of a pool of computing resources that can be accessed on demand while ensuring that they can be released and provisioned quickly without requiring extensive management effort or interaction with service providers (Beach et al., 2013). Several cloud services are commonly adopted by energy companies (Ahmad et al., 2021; Baliga et al., 2011), which contain software as a Service (SaaS), infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) (Markovic et al., 2013). This paper explores the most advantageous digital technologies by investigating the next General Purpose Technology (hereafter GPT) in the sector of energy following the preceding applications and definitions of new digital technologies for the sector of energy (Brynjolfsson et al., 2021). A GPT is distinguished by the following features according to two main theoretical perspectives. From a basic economic perspective, a GPT is considered as \"the ultimate application of technological advancements in a variety of sectors at the beginning and possessing Hicksian and complementary technologies in the implementation scenario\" (Crafts, 2004). A more precise definition of \"Hicksian complementarity\" is that an upsurge in one input factor's price results in an increase in the quantity in the production process. As a result of technological complementarity, the innovation's value will only become apparent when complementary technologies are developed or modified to complement the innovation, i.e., the value of innovation will only be apparent when complementary technologies are developed or modified to match it. As an example, GPTs, including mobile networks and electricity, are reliant upon complementary technologies to reach their full potential. In addition, according to innovation studies, a GPT is explained as the kind of technology field that generates innovation in multiple industries and leads to a continuous improvement in technology, emulating the nature of innovation, namely \"complementary, cumulative and dynamic.\" (Lipsey et al., 2005; Teece, 2018b). It is important to note that a GPT can be a process, a technology, a product, or even an organizational structure (Teece, 2018a). It is a new approach to integrating diverse technologies, including commercially mature technologies and specialized technologies, into a GPT development. Literature has previously indicated that advancements to a GPT can enhance productivity in downstream industries (Babina et al., 2022; Bressanelli et al., 2018). There is no doubt that a GPT will create continuous revenue and contribute to the growth of the economy (Moser and Nicholas, 2004). Furthermore, a GPT could also be understood as a collection of technologies that are related to one another, which could be conceptualized as a \"platform technology\" that is applicable to a variety of industries. AI is expected to be the next generation of generative processing technologies in comparison with other emerging technologies (Alekseeva et al., 2021; Hagen et al., 2020). Applied artificial intelligence complements various technological fields and increases productivity in an enormous manner (Babina et al., 2022). Some scholars believe that AI will be the most widely applied technology to gain the most widespread adoption in the energy industry (Lyu and Liu, 2021). 2.2 Digital technologies and energy firm outcomes Previously published research has demonstrated a consistent pattern of positive outcomes associated with digital technologies adoption at the firm level. Digital technologies, namely Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT), are argued to contribute to the performance of a business. Currently, there is an emerging literature stream examining the impact of new digital technologies on the performance of firms. As broadly recognized, firms' labor market power accounts for the favorable association between the performance of a firm and the skill demands of emerging digital technologies. It is important to note that firms with higher skill requirements also enjoy greater bargaining power and labor market power. Companies that require higher skill levels, for example, will have greater bargaining power and degree of labor market power. In addition, they are less susceptible to shocks resulting from changes in the labor market (An et al., 2021; Ikenaga and Kambayashi, 2016). For instance, consider SolarCity. In order to remain competitive, this well-known solar energy company is looking for the best personnel in energy storage systems and solar technology. As a result, SolarCity is able to perform well due to the highly qualified employees that it employs. The labor market power of a firm can be viewed as a measure of the company's growth potential. Despite the limited research on the labor market power of a firm, the literature at present does appear to be unanimous. The first benefit is that organizations with requirements for high skill levels are generally recognized employers who have excellent development prospects. Accordingly, such companies are expected to perform better. The second reason is that employers with high skill requirements possess greater bargaining power in the labor market than those with lower skill requirements. By doing so, the company will pay attention to the most talented and qualified employees, which will lead to improved productivity (Babina et al., 2022; Bloom and Van Reenen, 2007; Farboodi et al., 2019). Even though existing literature indicates that digital technologies can positively impact the performance of firms, most of the literature concentrates only on one detailed technology, for example, Cloud or AI (Alekseeva et al., 2021). It remains unclear which cutting-edge digital technology would provide the greatest benefit to the energy sector (Ahmad et al., 2021; Baumann and Kritikos, 2016). The sections below will investigate this study question in more detail. 3 Data and methodology 3.1 Sample data Regarding AI development, first trust NASDAQ artificial intelligence and robotics ETF (ROBT), global X robotics and artificial intelligence (BOTZ), and ishares robotics and artificial intelligence (IRBO) are used. The data is collected from May 01, 2019, to October 28, 2022. We analyze the volatility of the energy sector by looking at green bonds (SPGB), clean energy (SPGTCLEN), wind energy (GWE), solar energy (SUNIDX), natural gas (NGF), and crude oil (OVX). Our timeframe covers from May 01, 2019, to October 28, 2022. We compile the S&P Green Bond Index (SPGB), which is a market-weighted index consisting of green bonds from the energy sector around the globe. The Macerich Company global solar energy index net total return (SUNIDX) tracks the results of solar energy firms around the world. The ISE Global Wind Energy Index (GWE) measures the performance of public companies in the wind power industry based on an analysis of their products and services. Natural Gas Futures contracts (NGFs) require the buyer to obtain a specific quantity of natural gas. NGF specializes in delivering natural gas businesses internationally. Over the next 30 days, the volatility index (OVX) of CBOE crude oil ETF tracks volatility for Crude Oil. As a first step, we produce a log-differenced series. The statistical description of contemporaneous correlations for the artificial intelligence development index and environmental/green energy index is displayed in Panels A and B of Table 1 , correspondingly. As reported in Panel A, all indices for the green energy market have similar means and medians. Their standard deviations range from 7.96 to 375.97, in which ROBT (the artificial intelligence development index) exhibits the lowest values, and SPGTCLEN is the most volatile market. Differing from variables, SPGB and GWE have negative skewness. SPGB\u2019s kurtosis is significantly larger than those of different markets. By contrast, GWE and NGF possess the respective lowest and highest skewness and kurtosis values. As stated in Panel B, there are strong contemporaneous correlations between all series except NGF, which has a negative correlation to other markets. The relationship between ROBT and green energy markets is significant, with ROBT and GWE demonstrating the most considerable correlation. Ellington (2021) suggested that it is necessary to consider serial dependence and/or heavy tails when we model linkages among prices of commodities and volatility index. Table 1 provides the first insights into correlations between ROBT and five green energy variables. Moreover, these prices display a high level of persistence kurtosis values 3.2 Estimations from Bayesian vector heterogeneous autoregressions In this paper, we follow Ellington (2021) to employ a mixed fashion of the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) approach initially developed by Corsi (2009) coupled with Bayesian estimation developed by Chan (2020). This approach is best suited to our needs due to the following reasons. First, while this method significantly reduces computation time, the persistence inherent in price levels is captured appropriately. Second, by using the proposed method, the Kronecker structures can be imposed to model serially dependent error terms and non-Gaussian heteroscedastic, which better consider parameters and uncertainty based on the empirical database. Specifically, X s (an n \u00d7 1 vector) is monitored over s = 1, . . ., S time scales. The VHAR description is presented: X s = a 0 + A 1 X s \u2212 1 + A 5 X ( s \u2212 1 | t \u2212 5 ) + A 22 X ( s \u2212 1 | t \u2212 22 ) + v s where a 0 contains n constants, A\u2019s matrices contain n coefficients, which respectively illustrate autocorrelated relationships each day, every week, and every month. The lagged vectors of X s are X ( s \u2212 1 | t \u2212 k ) = 1 k \u2211 i = 1 k X s \u2212 j that consists of three food prices and GPR in the short, medium, and long runs. For simplicity, the VHAR model can be written as a VAR(22) with no constraints imposed on any autoregressive matrix. Hence, the VAR(3) structure can be presented as follows: X t = c 0 + \u2211 t = 1 3 C i Z s \u2212 1 + v s where a vector c 0 is a vector of constant values. This paper refers to the first, fifth, and twenty-second lags of X s by assigning the value of i to be 1, 5 and 22, respectively. We define Z \u2032 s = ( 1 , X \u2032 s \u2212 1 , X \u2032 s \u2212 5 , X \u2032 s \u2212 22 ) as a k \u00d7 1 vector where k = 1 + np. The reduced form is given as: (1) X = ZC + V with C ( C 0 , C 1 , C 5 , C 22 ) \u2032 is a k \u00d7 n matrice. More specifically, V is vec(V) \u223c N(0, \u03a3 \u2297 I T ) where vec( V ) includes the columns of V and I T are the T-dimensional identity matrix and the Kronecker product is captured by \u2297 . It is worth noting that we can obtain the covariance structures at cross-sections and serials of X individually by replacing I T with a T \u00d7 T covariance matrix \u03a6 . More specific, \u03a3 captures the cross-sectional analysis of covariance and \u03a6 reflects the sequential variance structure. Therefore, we write: (2) v e c ( V ) \u223c N ( 0 , \u03a3 \u2297 \u03a6 ) We can select distinct covariance structures for \u03a6 in models (1) and (2). In this regard, seven fashions with various covariance structures are employed in our paper, as in Chan (2020) and Ellington (2021). We also follow Chan (2020) and Ellington (2021) to employ model priors for all parameters. We utilize a 252- day rolling window to estimate these seven model fashions. 3.2.1 Network interlinkages By determining the variance of the matrix of forecast error variance decomposition, we develop network measures from VAR models. Then, Pesaran and Shin (1998) developed these measures by using generalized forecast error variance decompositions (GFEVDs). Time series are assumed to be uncorrelated, meaning that \u03a6 = I T . Rather than that, these measures are modified for a more general structure on \u03a6 in this paper. For a matrix A, ( A ) j , k , presents the jth row and kth column. ( B ) j presents the full jth row of B, and \u03a3B presents all elements added together in A. Since we can write X s as C(L) X s = v s with C(L) = [ I n \u2212 C 1 L 1 \u2212 \u2026 \u2212 C p L p ] being an n \u00d7 n matrix lag-polynomial. We also assume that the base of the VAR polynomial does not lie inside the unit circle to achieve the MA(\u221e) representation, X s = \u0398 ( L ) v s , where C(L) = [ \u0398 ( L ) ] \u2212 1 . In some exercises, we assume that the errors have an MA(1) representation, with v s = \u03f5 t + \u03c8 \u03f5 t \u2212 1 , \u03f5 t \u223c N ( 0 , \u03a3 ) . Therefore, we can indicate that v a r ( v s ) = ( 1 + \u0398 2 ) \u03a3 , where we define \u03a3 \u02dc = c\u03a3, with c = ( 1 + \u0398 2 ) . With our set-up, the covariance matrix of the forecast error conditional on information at time s \u2212 1 can be presented as follows: \u0393 H = \u2211 q = 0 Q \u0398 h \u03a3 \u02dc \u0398 h i . The forecast error covariance matrix based on shocks occurring now and in the future to the jth equations can be defined by using the conditional forecast error, which can be written as follows: 1 1 We can control \u0398 \u02dc d further to define pairwise interlinkage in Eqs. (4) to (6). \u03c2 v k ( Q ) = \u2211 q = 0 Q \u0398 h [ v s + Q \u2212 q \u2212 E ( v s + Q \u2212 q | v k , s + Q \u2212 q ] . And if we assume a normal distribution, we have: \u03c2 v k ( Q ) = \u2211 q = 0 Q \u0398 h [ v s + Q \u2212 q \u2212 \u03c3 \u02dc k k \u2212 1 ( \u2211 \u02dc ) k v k , s + Q \u2212 q ] . The covariance matrix is written as: \u0393 Q = \u2211 q = 0 Q \u0398 q \u223c \u0398 \u2032 q \u2212 \u03c3 \u02dc k k \u2212 1 \u2211 Q \u0398 q ( \u223c ) k ( \u223c ) k \u2032 \u0398 \u2032 q The unscaled Q-step ahead prediction error variance of the jth variable in relation to the change in the kth variable is: \u0394 ( j ) k Q = ( \u0393 Q \u2212 \u0393 Q k ) = \u03c3 \u02dc k k \u2212 1 \u2211 q = 0 Q ( ( \u0398 q \u2212 ) j , k ) 2 . We can obtain a way of expressing the GFEVD as in Pesaran and Shin (1998): ( \u03a8 Q ) j , k = \u03c3 \u02dc k k \u2212 1 \u2211 q = 0 Q ( ( \u0398 q \u03a3 \u02dc ) j , k ) 2 \u2211 q = 0 Q ( \u0398 q \u03a3 \u02dc \u0398 q \u2032 ) j , j where \u03c3 \u02dc k k = ( \u03a3 \u02dc ) k , k , \u0398 q denotes the MA coefficients (n \u00d7 n matrix) at lag q. ( \u03a8 Q ) j , k represents a variable k's contribution to variable j's the forecast error variance. The power spectrum, S y ( \u03c9 ) , is incorporated to investigate systems that diverse horizons form. We denote \u03c9 as the frequency component and we represent the spectral density that captures the Fourier transform of the infinite MA specification as follows: S x ( \u03c9 ) = \u2211 q = \u2212 \u221e \u221e E [ X s X s \u2212 q ] e \u2212 i \u03c9 q = \u0398 ( e \u2212 i \u03c9 ) \u03a3 \u02dc \u0398 \u2032 ( e + i \u03c9 ) We can write the generalized spectrum of causation over frequency components using the above representation \u03c9 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] and function of weighting to have a spectral specification of variance decompositions from variable j to k in X s . We can prove the presence of measures specific to horizons. We then present the generalized causation spectrum and weighting function as follows: ( f ( \u03c9 ) ) j , k = \u03c3 \u02dc k k \u2212 1 | ( \u0398 ( e \u2212 i \u03c9 ) ) j , k | 2 ( \u0398 ( e \u2212 i \u03c9 ) \u2211 \u02dc \u0398 \u2032 ( e \u2212 i \u03c9 ) ) j , j \u0393 j ( \u03c9 ) = ( \u0398 ( e \u2212 i \u03c9 ) \u223c \u0398 \u2032 ( e \u2212 i \u03c9 ) ) j , j 1 2 \u03c0 \u222b \u2212 \u03c0 \u03c0 ( \u0398 ( e \u2212 i \u03bb ) \u223c \u0398 \u2032 ( e \u2212 i \u03bb ) ) j , j d \u03bb and we define the variance decomposition matrix in terms of its spectral representation given as: ( d ) j , k = 1 2 \u03c0 \u222b d \u0393 j ( \u03c9 ) ( f ( \u03c9 ) ) j , k d \u03c9 If we sum all horizons, we can obtain ( \u03a8 Q ) j , k . Afterward, scaling \u03a8 d such that ( \u03a8 \u02dc d ) j , k = ( \u03a8 d ) j , k / \u2211 k ( \u03a8 H ) j , k delivers the adjacency matrix, \u03a8 \u02dc d over horizon band d, which can be written as: (3) D d = 100 \u00d7 ( \u2211 \u03a8 \u02dc d \u2211 \u03a8 \u02dc Q \u2212 T r { \u03a8 \u02dc d } \u2211 \u03a8 \u02dc Q ) Eq. (3) allows us to capture the forecast error variance's contribution stemming from all shocks within the designed structure but excluding our own shocks. It implies a horizon of interest that considers system-wide connectivity. \u03a8 \u02dc d also helps us to derive the direction of interconnections across horizons. Typically, to and from interlinkages are presented as follows: (4) D d , j \u2192 \u2022 = 100 \u00d7 \u2211 k = 1 , k \u2260 j n ( \u03a8 \u02dc d ) k , j \u2211 k = 1 , k = j n ( \u03a8 \u02dc H ) k , j (5) D d , j \u2190 \u2022 = 100 \u00d7 \u2211 k = 1 , k \u2260 j n ( \u03a8 \u02dc d ) k , j \u2211 k = 1 , k = j n ( \u03a8 \u02dc H ) k , j Eq. (4) captures the contribution of variable j to other variables\u2019 dynamics at horizon d. We use Eq. (5) to represent out-degrees. It is clear that the asset j\u2019s variance results from shocks arising in other variables at horizon d. We take their differentiation to calculate the net directional linkages at horizon d as follows: (6) D d , j N E T = D d , j \u2192 \u2022 \u2212 D d , j \u2190 \u2022 Hence, the positive values mean that variables exchange shocks, while negative values if they have sufficient shock transmission capacity, indicate the variable is the shock receiver 2 2 The results from these models can be provided by authors upon the request. . 4 Results 4.1 Model selection As a start, we will compare six models by averaging their log marginal likelihoods as in Chan (2020). Table 2 presents these statistics. According to Ellington's (2021) study, as these statistics increase, the model's fit is better. It is important to take into account serial correlation, stochastic volatility, and heavy tails. According to our findings, network measures derived from BHVAR-t-CSV-MA(1) or BHVAR-t-CSV have the most significant values of log marginal likelihoods. Additionally, it is important to make comparisons between networks formed from BHVAR-CSV and BHVAR-CSV-MA(1). 4.2 Network linkages 4.2.1 Time-horizon linkages In the following analysis, the particular network interlinkages are obtained from Eq. (3), in which d refers to short-run (between one day and one week), medium-run (from 1-week to 1-month), and long-term (larger than 1-month) horizons. The one-standard deviation and the posterior median percentile in terms of specific network interlinkage metrics are displayed in Fig. 1 . A network's short-, medium-, and long-term interlinkages are displayed in the top, middle, and bottom panels. Three key findings have been identified. Firstly, the long-run interlinkages between artificial intelligence development and green energy dynamics show the most strength, and they decrease sharply compared to the sample in the wars, in particular, peaking in July 2019 (COVID-19 pandemic outbreak), then fluctuations rise persistently and decline when new virus strains penetrate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, it decreased sharply before increasing again at the end of the sample due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict (in February 2022). As a second point, error bands refer to the fact that interlinkages occur over the long-run, and significant differences occur over the short-run and medium-run interlinkages. This significant difference emerged at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (from July 2019) and the Russia-Ukraine conflict (in February 2022). Thirdly, July 2019 is the month when there is a peak in short- and medium-run interlinkages. The trend also declined at the end of 2021 after experiencing considerable surges in 2021. COVID-19 pandemic strains spread through the global economy again at the end of 2020 and mid-2021, with severe consequences for a number of economies. Moreover, in the short term, the interlinkage became strong at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict occurs. Consequently, the world economy became extremely volatile during that time. Under uncertain conditions, short- and medium-term interconnections between markets will probably become stronger. As a temporary pandemic subsided in 2021, these interlinkages weakened slightly and continued to link when the Russia-Ukraine conflict occurred. Overall, network interconnections exhibit considerable differences at different time horizons. Over the short, medium, and long term, transient market events increase network interlinkages. Notably, we indicate the adverse impact of global uncertainty. A persistent COVID-19 health crisis has caused Baumeister et al. (2020) to emphasize the importance of long-term network interlinkages. 4.2.2 Net-directional linkages In the following step, we will study the net-directional connections between commodity prices and financial goods prices at different time horizons. Initially, we focus on the short run and the medium run. Short-term net-directional interlinkages, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , are posterior medians and one-standard deviation percentiles. It is noteworthy that the positive (negative) values of series j indicate its role as a shock transmitter (receiver). Note that variables j = {ROBT(IRBO, BOTZ), SPGB, SPGTCLEN, GWE, SUNIDX, NGF, OVX}. It is important to emphasize a few points here. All three Panels in Figs. 2 and 3 show a similar trend of the ROBT, BOTZ, and IRBO with green energy markets. BOTZ acted as a shock receiver from other markets two times, particularly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (at the end of 2019) and the Russia-Ukraine conflict (at the start of 2022). Meanwhile, ROBT and IRBO are shock transmitters before receiving a shock from the outside markets at the beginning of the disease outbreak. Notably, the role of ROBT, BOTZ, and IRBO become more apparent during uncertain times as the value means of indicators are more considerably volatile at that time. By contrast, the green energy markets mostly played the role of shock transmitters during our studied time, except for the natural gas market. However, the solar energy market turned out to be a shock receiver during the Russia-Ukraine conflict (starting in early 2022) as the mean value of SUNIDX became negative. Besides, clean energy and wind energy also became shock receivers during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis (from the beginning to mid-2021) but immediately returned to shock transmitters and, along with the green bonds market, became important channels to transmit shock during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In general, artificial intelligence development and the green energy market play more significant roles during uncertain times. Especially during the COVID-19 struck the globe and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the artificial intelligence development markets received a very strong shock from the wind energy, clean energy, and green bonds markets. Afterward, we examine the long-horizon net-directional linkages shown in Fig. 4 . Notably, the mean values of variables in our system fluctuated during our studied period, suggesting that the role of artificial intelligence development and the green energy market is inconsistent in the long term. Their roles are exchanged constantly. Furthermore, the importance of artificial intelligence development and the green energy market became more critical when the global economy was hit by some serious crises. Specifically, throughout the sample (from May 2019 to January 2022), the solar energy and clean energy markets demonstrate relatively similar time dynamics in the period of COVID-19 (from January 2020 to January 2021), and the Russia-Ukraine conflict (in early 2022), both act as a conventional transmission. They have become shock receivers from January 2021- December 2021, while the green bonds and natural gas markets operate in contrast to transmit shock. During the research stage, all three artificial intelligence development markets serve as a vital shock received. Suddenly, it became a shock transmitter during the illness crisis of COVID-19 (from May 2019 to January 2020) and the Russia-Ukraine conflict (from early 2022). These results support those of Ren and Lucey (2022), who found a tenuous link between clean energy and the spread of digital technology, indicating that clean energy may someday be employed as a hedging and diversification strategy for the use of digital technology. The growth of some commodity markets has been noted before in conjunction with various financial crises (2007\u20132009), as indicated by Balcilar et al. (2021) and Zhang and Broadstock (2020). To gauge the model's forecasting power, we calcuate mean absolute forecast errors (MAFE) and log predictive scores as in Ellington (2021). Table 3 outlines these statistics. The results indicate that BHVAR-CSV model fit to all dataset. On the other hand, BHVAR-t-CSV-MA (1) model fit to the bseline dataset make up the model condifence set. 4.2.3 Robustness check In order to verify our findings, we take logs of all series and analyze them as described in Section 4.2.2. A few of our results are reported in the Appendix, and the others can be provided upon request in order to save space. Generally, we find the same conclusions as we did previously, indicating the conclusions regarding dynamic network interlinkages are valid and robust. 5 Conclusion and policy implications This paper aims to explore fat tails and connections between artificial intelligence (AI) development and green energy markets. While regarding AI development, we use ROBT, BOTZ and IRBO, and the green energy market, including Green Bonds, Clean Energy, Wind Energy, Solar Energy, Natural Gas, and Crude Oil, in a seven-fold Bayesian vector heterogeneous autoregression model. It differentiates between shorter-run, medium-run, and longer-run network interlinkages among these markets. Our time series covers from May 01, 2019, to October 28, 2022. The following two points deserve special attention. As a first step, it is crucial that the artificial intelligence development and green energy markets are more statistically and remarkedly interconnected in the long run. Additionally, the pattern of long-run network interlinkages differs from the pattern of short-run and medium-run interlinkages. After the COVID-19 pandemic spreads out, the Russia-Ukraine conflict occurs, and these distinctions become more evident. During uncertain times, network interlinkages among various types of markets are also likely to increase in size. Second, market directional links indicate a shift in roles (from shock receiver to shock transmitter) before the Russia-Ukraine conflict, whereas these roles persist during the COVID-19 pandemic. The short- and medium-horizon measures indicate that during COVID-19 struck the globe and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the artificial intelligence development markets received a very strong shock from the wind energy, clean energy, and green bonds markets. During the pandemic period of COVID-19 begin to settle, the artificial intelligence development markets become shocking transmit. The natural gas market is less volatile in the short- and medium-run, while according to long-horizon measures, it is shock transmitters from January 2020 to January 2021. At the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, solar energy and clean energy markets act as shock receptors (transmitters). 5.1 Theoretical improvements In our research, we are the first to offer a unique deep explanation of the interconnectedness between AI development and the energy market, specifically in chaotic events like the COVID-19 epidemic or the global political conflict in the short-, medium-, and long-run. Using the special method, the short-, medium-, and long-run pairwise connectedness estimate spread channels between the AI, FinTech, Robotic development and the dynamic of energy market. We contribute crucial information and warnings about the spread of uncertain occurrences and policies for regulators and investors (Figs. A.1\u2013A.4). 5.2 Practical applications Findings from our study have important consequences for financial institutions and government agencies, as well as practices from the contagions in different markets, as well as their interconnectedness on the policy front. Policymakers can also design appropriate policies to reduce the vulnerabilities of such markets and prevent risk spread and instability if they know the crucial antecedents of contagions among them, including oil, gold, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Based on our findings, there are strong links between the four market segments, which emphasize investor risks associated with low and high diversification. As a result of our results, it is becoming increasingly clear that unpredictable events are interconnected. It is evident that a sudden change in a traditional market impacts a network as a whole, suggesting that investors and managers should be more cautious in managing the investment portfolio, which includes gold, oil in futures contracts, stocks, and cryptocurrency. An early warning signal would be the contagions of uncertainty and risk that should be considered when making an investment decision. In addition, this paper's findings can also be useful in enhancing public welfare, which is a direct result of financialization, oil, cryptocurrency, and gold. The crucial insights that there are ambiguities and risks in the energy sector must be applied to financial markets reversely. Consequently, designing policies to enhance the welfare of a vulnerable group must take these factors into account. 5.3 Limitations and directions for future research Three limitations remain with the research results. We must first emphasize that no general principle or pattern can be found that applies to all cases regarding how risk occurrences impact total, net, or pairwise spillovers in the short-, medium-, and long-run. Secondly, the extent of the spread is significant from the perspective of indicator association. In the case of a large spread, changes and shocks brought about by other indicators will have a significant impact on a particular market system. A variety of measures must be taken by the government in order to lessen the negative effects of external shocks. Authorities should concentrate on frequency-specific danger sources. In integrating global regulatory guidelines for different metrics, more emphasis should be placed on reducing the negative consequences of long-term fluctuation spreads and short-term return spreads. Furthermore, since many researchers consider the spillover effect across multiple metrics, evaluating the portfolio advantages of diversity is a significant step forward. As a result, it was placed on hold for the time being.

As technology continues to advance, there is a growing interest in leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance project management practices. Generative AI refers to a branch of AI that utilizes algorithms and machine learning techniques to generate new, creative solutions or optimize existing processes. The application of generative AI in project management holds the promise of automating repetitive tasks, optimizing resource allocation, and improving risk assessment, among other potential benefits (Taboada et al., 2023; Prifti, 2022; Auth & Wiecha, 2021; Kuster, 2021; Polonevych et al., 2020; Gil et al., 2020). However, although there are some studies comparing tasks performed by generative AI to the same tasks performed by humans (Haase& Hanel, 2023; Jakesch et al., 2022; Korteling et al., 2021), to the knowledge of the authors of this paper, there are no comparative studies of generative AI and human decision-making to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach related to project management. Previous studies have highlighted the potential of AI to improve work performance, automate routine tasks, optimize resource allocation, and supplement decision-making processes (Salleh & Aziz, 2022; Davahli, 2020). For instance, data on the effects of AI on individuals and their jobs in the industrial and financial sectors of seven nations was gathered by the OECD in 2022. Although also bringing risks, the results demonstrate that using AI at work can benefit employees in terms of job satisfaction, health, and compensation (OECD, 2023). But within the context of project management, a key aspect to explore is the content and structure of project plans. Project plans provide a blueprint for successful project execution, outlining deliverables, tasks, timelines, and resource allocation. This raises the question: how do project plans generated by AI compare to those created by a human project manager in terms of its content and structure? Through this comparative analysis, we aim to contribute to answering this question, shedding light on the benefits and limitations of each approach. Therefore, by examining the anatomy of a specific project plan, we seek to understand the effectiveness of generative AI in project management, with the aim of contributing to the existing literature, by offering an in-depth exploration of the potentialities of its use in the macro planning process of a project. Studies (Bang et al., 2022; Servranckx and Vanhoucke, 2021; Durmic, 2021) highlight the critical role of diligent planning in increasing the overall success of a project. 2 Literature review Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in several fields. Korzynski et al. (2023) suggest that some management theories and concepts need to be studied in the generative AI environment since it may influence managerial work at the strategic, functional, and administrative levels (Gyory et al., 2022). It would be na\u00efve if not unrealistic to imagine that project management would not be affected as well. By harnessing algorithms and machine learning techniques, generative AI systems could generate novel ideas, optimize processes, and make data-driven decisions. 2.1 Advancements and applications of generative AI One of the most prominent advancements within the domain of generative AI is the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models epitomize the ability of AI to understand, generate, and transform human language. Within the generative AI category, one that has gained considerable attention is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a language model developed by OpenAI (Radford et al., 2018). Rooted in the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), the GPT series has exhibited a paradigm shift in natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, particularly in tasks such as text generation, translation, and question-answering. LLMs, such as ChatGPT (versions GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), are trained on extensive text corpora and have showcased remarkable capabilities across numerous NLP tasks. Specifically, ChatGPT has proven its versatility in areas like education, healthcare, reasoning, text generation, human-computer interaction, and scientific inquiry. More so, while the adaptation of large language models (LLM) to autonomous agents like Auto-GPT indicates their potential in achieving a degree of general intelligence, there are inherent challenges in directly utilizing LLMs in this capacity. The proposed agents operate through a sophisticated workflow, allowing the model to essentially communicate with itself without the need for human intervention (Yang et al., 2023). Noy and Zhang (2023) demonstrate that the implementation of ChatGPT leads to significant improvements in productivity and output quality. The time taken for tasks decreases, and the quality of the produced work improves. Also, the use of ChatGPT reduces inequality among workers by benefiting those with lower abilities. Eloundou et al. (2023) corroborate these findings, when suggesting that with large language models (LLMs) like GPT, about 15% of all worker tasks could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share could increase up to 56%. 2.2 Impacts on project management and human decision-making In the realm of project management, generative AI can automate repetitive tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, freeing up human project managers to focus on higher-level strategic activities. Besides, generative AI can assist in risk assessment and mitigation by analyzing large datasets and identifying potential issues or bottlenecks. Polonevych et al. (2020) provide insights into the applications of artificial intelligence in project management, highlighting its potential to streamline processes and improve project outcomes. While generative AI brings unique capabilities to project management, human decision-making remains integral to the success of projects. Human project managers possess a range of skills and qualities that are difficult to replicate with AI systems alone. Decision-making, problem-solving, creativity, and interpersonal skills are among the valuable attributes that human project managers bring to the table. These abilities are particularly crucial in complex and dynamic project environments where adaptability, intuition, and social intelligence play significant roles. Choi et al. (2021) also emphasize the importance of human intelligence in sustainable management solutions for plant projects, highlighting how human project managers can navigate the complexities of project execution and foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. By understanding the contributions of human intelligence, we can gain a comprehensive perspective on the interplay between generative AI and human decision-making in project management. Nieto-Rodriguez and Vargas (2023) reported that only 35% of projects today are completed successfully and one reason for this disappointing rate is the low level of maturity of technologies available for project management. The authors suggest that this is on the threshold of change as researchers, startups, and innovating organizations are beginning to apply AI, machine learning, and other advanced technologies to project management. The same idea is corroborated by Khatib and Falasi (2021) when affirming that AI applications enhance data quality and improve the speed and effectiveness of decision-making. Keeping those considerations into account, it would be natural to assume that the role of project managers is also about to change (Skinner, 2022). 2.3 Human-AI dynamics in project management To gain a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of generative AI and human judgment in project management, comparative studies have been conducted. Gyory et al. (2021) presents a data-driven approach to real-time process management in complex engineering design, considering both AI and human involvement. Their study explores how generative AI systems can contribute to decision-making and process optimization in project management, while also acknowledging the unique strengths and insights brought by a human project manager. Furthermore, Zurita et al. (2022) provide valuable data on an experiment that directly compares the performance of human and AI process managers. By examining the impact and effectiveness of both AI and human process managers, their findings elucidate the advantages and limitations of each approach. Through such comparative analyses, we can better understand the contexts in which generative AI or human expertise excels and identify potential synergies for effective project management practices. Although some authors argue that AI cannot replace the human mind (Alshaikhi et al., 2021), trust and cooperation between AI systems and human project managers are critical for successful collaboration in project management. Zhang et al. (2022) investigate the effects of teammate identity and performance on trust and cooperation in Human-AI collaboration. Their study explored how the perception of AI as a teammate influences the willingness to cooperate and trust its decisions. Despite the potential benefits of integrating AI into project management, challenges and obstacles remain (G\u00eengu\u021b\u0103 et al., 2023; Regona et al., 2022). These include ethical and technical difficulties in implementing AI systems, lack of understanding and skills among project managers to effectively use AI, and resistance to change. That's why understanding the dynamics of trust and cooperation between humans and AI in project management is essential for effective utilization of generative AI technologies. By examining the findings from this study, we can gain insights into how trust in AI systems can be fostered, and how the collaboration between humans and AI can be optimized to maximize project outcomes. 3 Methodology 3.1 Rationale The objective of this study was to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of a project plan prepared by a generative AI system like ChatGPT powered by its most capable model (GPT-4), with a project plan developed by a human project manager in terms of various project management parameters. We chose GPT-4 for this study due to its remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. With its large-scale language model trained on diverse internet text, it excels in delivering detailed and credible narratives, which aligns with our study's objective (OpenAI, 2023; Koubaa, 2023). The evolution of the GPT models, from GPT-1 to GPT-4, has marked significant improvements in text generation capabilities, context understanding, and efficiency. While GPT-1 and GPT-2 already demonstrated powerful capabilities, GPT-3 made a giant leap in terms of producing human-like text that could potentially offer more nuanced and effective communication plans, better understanding of project requirements, and more accurate cost estimations. GPT-4, the model chosen for this study, builds upon the capabilities of GPT-3 but is even more robust and efficient, making it more equipped to handle complex project planning tasks (OpenAI, 2023). 3.2 Context The proposal also aimed to align the practices proposed by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge, also known as the PMBOK Guide (PMI, 2021) was utilized as it provides a framework for managing projects and is widely accepted in various industries globally (Amaro & Domingues, 2023; Takagi & Varaj\u00e3o, 2020). It contains rigorous and comprehensive standards for project management, making it an excellent point of comparison for our AI-based project management approach. Other researchers have already analyzed the potential of AI in project management knowledge areas (Fridgeirsson et al., 2021), but not necessarily through a comparative study between deliverables produced by generative AI and a human project manager. Another critical component of this study's methodology was the selection of a suitable project type for comparison. The decision was to focus on a specific sector of growing relevance: the digital technology sector. More specifically, both the AI and the human project manager were given the task of planning an application development project. This choice was motivated by several reasons. First, app development projects are commonplace in today's digital era, and their relevance extends across numerous industries, making our findings widely applicable. Second, app development is a complex process that encompasses a wide range of project management knowledge areas with a breadth that allows for a comprehensive evaluation of project planning. 3.3 Experiment set-up In our study, we engaged both a human project manager and ChatGPT in planning the \u201cBeauty Find App\u201d project. The fundamental objective of this venture was to create an innovative mobile application that merges technology, security, and utility to provide users with a myriad of beauty and aesthetic services. This user-centric design was intended to facilitate quick, intuitive access to top-tier services offered by both businesses and independent contractors located in the user's vicinity. The advanced features of the application encompass search, scheduling, communication, and rating for professionals and establishments in the beauty and aesthetic sectors. Such features would be invaluable to consumers who would primarily use the application for the convenience it offers, such as onsite attendance at their chosen location, time savings, detachment, privacy, 24-h scheduling, and the receipt of service confirmations via email, SMS, or WhatsApp. Moreover, it would allow customers to evaluate the services they've received, further enhancing the application's value proposition. The \u201cBeauty Find App\u201d project was designed with a wide range of beauty services in mind, such as aesthetic procedures, a virtual beauty agenda, and recommendations on beauty and aesthetics. It is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms, making it a versatile tool for our comparative study. Professionals adhering to the application's guidelines would also reap benefits from the project. They would gain access to a clientele that values convenience and technology, receive fair commissions, and enjoy the flexibility to tailor their workdays to suit their preferences. Thus, the application promises to serve as a beneficial platform for both service providers and consumers. It's relevant to clarify that when the plan was elaborated by the project manager, it was never meant for any kind of comparison, but for an actual business implementation. The plan was created and documented following the guidelines set out in PMI's planning artifacts (PMI, 2022) by a project manager with 10 years of experience in the field, independent consultant contracted for this project, who owns a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification by PMI. These authors provided the same project requirements and parameters as input to the GPT-4 model afterward. For the purpose of a structured comparison, the project artifacts derived from both the AI-generated and human-generated plans were meticulously organized in accordance with the PMI Knowledge Management Areas. The analysis purposefully left out the project procurement part. This exclusion was motivated by the fact that project procurement involves critical decision-making processes such as make-or-buy decisions and supplier choices, which were beyond the scope of this particular study. One may argue that new technologies such as GPT agents and Auto-GPT could be used for procurement automation purposes. Nevertheless, although we acknowledge the potential of these recent technological advancements, it is crucial to recognize that these technologies are currently in the experimental open-source phase and have not yet been extensively validated for such ends. A mind map (Fig. 1 ) is provided to visually illustrate each knowledge management area along with the corresponding research artifacts selected, serving to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the planning methodology deployed. 3.4 Data collection This study employs a primarily qualitative methodology to analyze and compare the project plans developed by a generative AI model and a human project manager. The first phase involved the collection of project plans developed by the GPT-4 AI model and a human project manager. Both the AI model and the human project manager were provided with the same set of requirements and guidelines for structuring a project plan for mobile application development. The project manager built his plan first in approximately 3 weeks. The prompts for ChatGPT were later entered by these authors approximately 1 month after the human project plan was created but based on the same requirements as the project manager. For instance, the initial prompt for ChatGPT was: \u201cImagine that you are an experienced project manager with a PMP certification who is going to manage a team to develop an app called \"Beauty Find\". The app aims to offer its users beauty and aesthetic services aligning technology, safety, and convenience. In a short time, customers will be able to access a wide range of quality services, performed by the best freelance professionals and establishments in their location area. Could you prepare a detailed project plan with PMI standards for this project?\u201d From this prompt on, others had to be generated based on the answers presented by ChatGPT. Mainly by requesting more complete artifacts, such as resource plan, schedule, among others. The sequence of prompts/answers derived from this first prompt was approximately 15 rounds, among which, the one that most demanded clarification was the preparation of the schedule, since it was requested that it could be copied and pasted into MS-Project type software. Each round aimed to obtain answers as close as possible to the desired project management artifact standard, but always passing through the scrutiny of these authors. Regarding this analysis, it's relevant to mention that both have more than 15 years of experience in project management and a background in technology. One of them is a PMP-certified professional as well. 3.5 Data analysis In a second moment, the content and structure of the AI-generated and human-generated project plans were compared in detail by the authors of this research, including an examination of scope preparation, schedule development, cost estimation, resources evaluation, quality planning, stakeholder mapping, communication planning, and risk analysis. Then a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated and human-generated project plans was done by these authors. This incorporates a discussion of the areas in which the AI model excels, the areas in which the human project manager excels, and the potential synergies between the two approaches. 3.6 Data interpretation and ethical framework In the concluding segment of this research, the authors discussed the implications of the findings for project management practices. This includes recommendations for how project managers can leverage the strengths of AI models like GPT-4 while compensating for their weaknesses with human expertise. The results of the study were organized and presented in a comparative format, as outlined in the phases above. This structured approach allows for a direct comparison of the performance of the generative AI model and the human project manager in each area of project plan development. By analyzing and presenting results in this way, this study was able to better understand the contexts in which generative AI or human experience excel and identify potential synergies for effective project management practices. The qualitative examination favors the collection of rich and detailed data, in addition to enabling the revelation of important new insights, in an exploratory research such as the one that was carried out. The study ensured the anonymity of sensitive data while still offering important insights into the effectiveness of GPT-4 generated project plans compared to those created by human project managers adhering to PMBOK Guide standards. This was accomplished through the preservation of project company details for ethical reasons, adherence to the guidelines provided in PMI's PMBOK Guide, and the appropriate selection of evaluation metrics. The chosen methodology allowed for an unbiased evaluation while respecting confidentiality, making it suitable for answering the research question and maintaining ethical standards. 4 Results In this section, we carry out a side-by-side comparison of project artifacts generated by the AI and those produced by an experienced human project manager. Each artifact was critically evaluated to assess its alignment with best practices, its completeness, its clarity, and its overall utility in achieving project objectives. Each knowledge area provides a unique lens through which to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the AI-generated project plans in comparison to their human-developed counterparts. 4.1 Project integration Even though the PMBOK Guide (PMI, 2021) considers the project charter an artifact that should be produced during the initiation macro-process (not of planning), we also considered this artifact for the purpose of this research since it represents a pre-version of the project plan itself. Having made that initial disclaimer, the comparison between the AI-generated project charter and the human-generated project charter in the project integration area revealed distinct characteristics as presented on Table 1 . The AI-generated version presented a concise and clear overview of the mobile application project, outlining its objectives, scope, and key success factors. On the other hand, the human-generated version offered a more detailed and contextualized overview, incorporating market research data and justifying the project based on the demand for beauty services and the availability of skilled professionals. Additionally, the human-generated version included more specific and measurable objectives, along with a comprehensive scope that encompassed further considerations and details. The deliverables, key success factors, user satisfaction, market adoption, and constraints and dependencies were also compared, highlighting the variations between the two versions. 4.2 Project scope For the purposes of this research paper, we considered four main artifacts produced by the project scope management knowledge area: the scope statement, work breakdown structure, WBS dictionary, and requirements traceability matrix (RTM). A summary of the findings can be found in Table 2 . The AI-generated scope statement provided a detailed overview of the project's aim - to develop and launch an innovative mobile app connecting users to a range of beauty and aesthetic services. SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, with a time bound) objectives were explicitly stated, giving a solid direction for the project. The AI also identified and elaborated on assumptions, constraints, benefits, and exclusions. However, it did not explicitly state all project constraints and exclusions. Despite these omissions, the AI-generated scope statement was comprehensive, providing a broad view of expected deliverables and outcomes. In contrast, the human-generated scope statement included extra elements such as project name, refined objectives, assumptions, constraints, benefits, exclusions, and project phases. These additions offered more specificity that could be useful for project execution and control. Both scope statements met the requirements for an exhaustive scope statement. The AI-generated WBS featured a more extensive coverage of project deliverables, incorporating 13 main deliverables with 37 sub-deliverables. The tasks covered a range from project initiation to closure, addressing critical facets such as requirements analysis, design and development, database and infrastructure, implementation of various features, testing and quality assurance, deployment and launch, training and documentation. The human-generated WBS encompassed six main deliverables and 22 sub-deliverables. This WBS showed a greater emphasis on project management, monitoring, and control, with explicit mention of marketing and publicity. The AI-generated WBS dictionary provided a detailed breakdown of project deliverables using a hierarchical structure. Each deliverable had a unique ID, description, and acceptance criteria. It demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of project deliverables and considerations, encompassing various project areas. The human-generated WBS dictionary followed a similar structure, providing a breakdown of project deliverables with unique IDs, names, descriptions, and acceptance criteria. It also reflected a comprehensive approach to project management, addressing various critical aspects of the project. The AI-generated RTM provided a comprehensive breakdown of both functional and non-functional requirements for the project. The functional requirements encompassed user registration, service search and visualization, user-provider communication, payment processing, and more. The non-functional requirements focused on usability and security aspects. The matrix demonstrated a meticulous approach to requirement identification and description, ensuring clarity and comprehensiveness. The human-generated RTM presented a structured and comprehensive overview of project requirements. It included requirement IDs, descriptions, priorities, related IDs, and WBS IDs associated with each requirement. The matrix captured a total of 10 requirements without explicitly differentiating between functional and non-functional aspects. While a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d RTM ensures that every requirement is covered, a \u201cbalanced\u201d RTM ensures that one type of requirement is not overemphasized at the expense of another. Both are critical, and the project manager's attention should be focused on both considerations. 4.3 Project schedule The AI-generated schedule and the human-generated schedule exhibited significant disparities in terms of complexity and level of detail. While the AI-generated schedule proposed a total of 25 activities, the human-generated schedule consisted of a more intricate structure, comprising 175 activities. This stark contrast indicates that the human-generated schedule encompassed a more comprehensive breakdown of tasks and subtasks, resulting in a higher level of granularity. Besides the differences in the number of activities, the two schedules displayed variations in terms of predecessors, dependencies, and project duration. The AI-generated schedule provided a limited number of explicit predecessors, primarily focusing on the immediate sequential relationships between activities. On the other hand, the human-generated schedule incorporated a more intricate web of dependencies, considering both immediate and indirect relationships between activities. This comprehensive approach in the human-generated schedule allowed for a more detailed understanding of the project's flow and interdependencies. Also, the total project duration showed a slight 3-month forecast variance between the AI-generated version (12 months) and the human project manager version (15 months). The sequencing and order of activities differed between the two schedules. The AI-generated schedule often suggested parallel execution of certain tasks, assuming that they could be performed simultaneously without dependencies or conflicts. In contrast, the human-generated schedule demonstrated a more sequential and phased approach, reflecting a deeper understanding of the project's requirements and interdependencies. The human-generated schedule also provided further details and considerations that were not present in the AI-generated schedule. For instance, it included specific milestones, deliverables, and quality control checkpoints, ensuring that the project progressed according to predefined criteria. These additional elements in the human-generated schedule contributed to a more comprehensive and structured project plan. Also, it incorporated a more comprehensive resource allocation plan, considering factors such as personnel, equipment, and budgetary constraints. It accounted for specific resource requirements and availability, enabling a more realistic assessment of project timelines and potential bottlenecks. In contrast, the AI-generated schedule lacked detailed resource allocation considerations, potentially overlooking critical constraints and feasibility issues. The AI-generated schedule's simplicity and limited number of activities may offer advantages in terms of ease of understanding and quick initial planning. However, the human-generated schedule's complexity and attention to detail provide a more robust foundation for project execution, enabling comprehensive monitoring, control, and risk management throughout the project lifecycle. Table 3 summarizes the comparison between the two approaches. 4.4 Project costs The AI-generated cost estimates for the project provided a monthly breakdown of planned costs and resources based on the initial plans. The estimates ranged from $20,000 in the first month to $14,000 in the twelfth month, covering various development, testing, and implementation activities. The AI emphasized the importance of regular monitoring and adjustments to ensure alignment with actual expenditures, recognizing the dynamic nature of project costs. The total estimated cost for the project amounted to $105,000 over the twelve-month duration. These comprehensive estimates serve as a valuable tool for financial planning, resource allocation, and cost control throughout the project lifecycle. In contrast, the human-generated cost estimates took a meticulous approach, considering direct, indirect, fixed, and variable costs for each resource involved in the project. The detailed breakdown allowed for precise financial planning and control. The human-generated estimates totaled $258,606, providing stakeholders with a complete understanding of the project's financial scope and impact. This total served as a benchmark for budget allocation, decision-making, and ongoing cost monitoring. Table 4 offers an overview of the two approaches main aspects. 4.5 Project resources The AI-generated resource plan for the project encompassed various roles, material resources, and other related expenses. The plan provided a breakdown of the hourly rates and market costs for each resource, as well as average monthly costs. It included key project management personnel, such as the Project Manager, Backend Developers, Frontend Developers, and Interface Designers were also accounted for, each with their respective hourly rates and monthly costs. The plan recognized the importance of specialized roles, including a Database Specialist, Testers, and a Data Security Specialist, each with their own hourly rates and monthly costs. Apart from human resources, the AI-generated plan considered material resources required for the project. This included Servers and Infrastructure, Software Licenses, Equipment and Mobile Devices. The estimated costs for these resources were based on market averages. The plan also acknowledged the need for external services, such as Data Security Consultancy, and allocated a budget for such services. Besides, training and capacity-building were recognized as important elements of resource planning, with a designated budget to cover associated costs. On the other hand, the human-generated resource plan involved a more specific allocation of roles and responsibilities compared to the AI-generated plan. The plan identified key resources essential for project success, including a Project Manager, a Requirements Analyst, Android Developers, iOS Developers, a Test Analyst, and a Web Designer specializing in User Experience (UX). Each resource played a distinct role in the project, contributing their expertise to different aspects of development, testing, and design. Table 5 shows the main differences between both approaches. In addition to outlining the roles, the human-generated plan included a RACI Matrix to clarify the responsibilities and involvement of each resource. The matrix identified who should be Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each project task or deliverable. This level of detail enhanced communication, accountability, and coordination among team members, ensuring that everyone understood their roles and responsibilities within the project. The plan also emphasized the importance of considering the desirable profile for each resource. By specifying the desired characteristics, skills, and qualifications for each role, the plan aimed to ensure the selection of the most suitable individuals to fulfill the project's requirements. This consideration of resource profiles can contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the project team, as it helps to align the skill sets of the resources with the specific demands of the project. 4.6 Project quality The AI-generated quality plan aims to ensure the delivery of a functional, high-quality, and error-free application by emphasizing user expectations in terms of usability, performance, and security. The strategy outlined in the plan includes comprehensive testing approaches, agile development practices, code reviews, quality metrics, and clear acceptance criteria. Specific quality activities such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing, performance testing, security testing, and code reviews are described. The plan assigns responsibilities to project stakeholders, highlights the need for appropriate tools and resources, and emphasizes the integration of quality activities into the project schedule. While the AI-generated plan provides valuable insights into quality management, it lacks certain elements such as auditing, nonconformity treatment, and comprehensive performance monitoring. In contrast, the human-generated quality plan takes a more all-encompassing approach by incorporating not only testing activities but also auditing, nonconformity treatment, performance monitoring, and a comprehensive tests plan. It provides a detailed breakdown of activities necessary to achieve quality requirements, along with responsible individuals and their frequency. The plan also incorporates various control tools such as cause-and-effect diagrams and histograms. It places a strong focus on compliance, continuous improvement, and effective monitoring of project performance. Table 6 below reflects both approaches (see Table 7). 4.7 Project stakeholders The comparison between the AI-generated and human-generated stakeholder plans reveals the importance of identifying and involving diverse stakeholders in project management. The AI-generated plan successfully identified and categorized various stakeholders for the application project, including end-users, development and testing teams, company managers and directors, investors and shareholders, beauty service providers, regulatory and governmental bodies, market competitors, strategic partners, and collaborators. The plan aimed to establish effective communication and engagement strategies tailored to each stakeholder group, taking into consideration their power and interest in the project. Similarly, the human-generated stakeholder plan provided a comprehensive list of stakeholders to consider for the project. The stakeholders encompassed clients or users of the application, sponsors and investors, the project team, independent service providers, beauty salons, pharmaceutical companies, employees' family members, communities, development and maintenance team, marketing campaign company, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), regulatory bodies, competitors, press, digital media channels, opinion leaders, and unions. By including stakeholders from various domains, the plan recognized the broader impact and interconnections between the project and its stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of effective engagement and communication with each group. Both the AI-generated and human-generated stakeholder plans recognized the importance of identifying and involving diverse stakeholders in project management. The AI-generated plan demonstrated a structured method for stakeholder identification and involvement, utilizing a power-interest matrix to classify stakeholders based on their influence and interest in the project. This approach provided valuable insights into the appropriate level of participation for each stakeholder group. Conversely, the human-generated plan exhibited a comprehensive list of stakeholders that extended beyond the immediate project scope, acknowledging the potential impacts and interconnections between the project and various organizations. Table 7 highlights elements from both approaches. 4.8 Project communications The AI-generated communications plan prioritized clear and consistent communication throughout the project lifecycle. It aimed to keep stakeholders well-informed about project progress, milestones, and updates while addressing their concerns promptly. The plan utilized various communication channels, including team meetings, email updates, in-app notifications, stakeholder workshops, and community engagement events. Key messages focused on project updates, the benefits of the application, and guidelines for freelance professionals and establishments. The plan also established a communication schedule, specifying the timing of different communication activities. Responsibilities for communication were assigned to specific roles, such as the project sponsor, project manager, project team members, and marketing and communications team. The human-generated communications plan encompassed a range of communication methods, including a monitoring newsletter, website, correspondence, company presentations, quality reports, and institutional videos. Its objectives were to provide general information about the company, promote the brand, and update stakeholders on service quality. The newsletter served as a comprehensive source of information regarding the quantity of services provided and registered service providers. The website aimed to promote the brand and inform interested individuals about the services offered. Correspondence was structured to address specific topics with clear indexing. Company presentations showcased the overall situation of the organization, while quality reports updated stakeholders on the quality of services. Institutional videos were developed to enhance brand visibility and highlight the services offered. Table 8 below emphasizes aspects of both approaches (see Table 9). 4.9 Project risks The AI-generated risk plan demonstrated a comprehensive approach to risk management, encompassing all stages from identification to response planning. Risk identification was thorough, covering a range of potential threats and opportunities. Risks were further qualified by categorizing them into specific domains such as legal/regulatory, technology, market/users, and finance. This allowed for a more focused understanding of the areas that posed the greatest risks. Furthermore, the AI-generated plan went beyond mere identification by qualitatively and quantitatively assessing risks. Probability and impact were evaluated, providing a more objective basis for risk prioritization. The inclusion of both threats and opportunities highlighted the plan's holistic approach to risk management. In terms of response planning, the AI-generated plan provided specific strategies tailored to each identified risk. Response actions were defined, emphasizing proactive measures to mitigate potential negative impacts and capitalize on opportunities. Also, contingencies were planned, as part of the risk response plan, but no management reserves were considered. Some mitigation actions as well as contingency values were not updated on the costs plan. This comprehensive risk response planning ensured that the project team was well-prepared to address challenges as they arose. The plan's consideration of risk quantification facilitated resource allocation and decision-making, enabling the team to prioritize their efforts effectively. In general, the AI-generated risk plan demonstrated a rigorous and structured approach to risk management, enhancing the project's chances of success. On the other hand, the human-generated risk plan focused primarily on risk identification without a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risks were listed without clear categorization or qualitative and quantitative assessment. This limited the plan's ability to prioritize risks and allocate appropriate resources. On top of that, the absence of risk response strategies hindered the project team's preparedness to address potential challenges. The human-generated plan also neglected to consider potential opportunities that could arise during the project, failing to capture the full spectrum of risks and rewards. Table 9, underscores features of each approach. 5 Discussion The analysis sought to explore the strengths and limitations of both approaches, highlighting the potential synergies and trade-offs that emerge when combining artificial intelligence with human expertise in project management. By examining each knowledge area in detail valuable insights were gained into the contrasting characteristics and performance of the AI-generated and human-generated plans. The investigation also shed light on the critical role of human insights in interpreting and refining AI-generated outputs, refining prompt engineering, and leveraging domain knowledge to optimize project outcomes. 5.1 Knowledge contribution Beginning with the project charter, the comparison between the AI-generated and human-generated project charters revealed important distinctions, raising several points for consideration. It became apparent that the level of information and contextual awareness differed significantly between the AI-generated and human-generated versions. While the AI-generated version provided a clear and concise outline of the project, it lacked the depth and uniqueness found in the human-generated version. The incorporation of market research data, such as the demand for beauty services and the potential pool of freelancing workers, strengthened the project's justification in the human-generated charter. In terms of objectives, both versions shared the common goal of developing and launching the application within a specified timeframe while ensuring a user-friendly interface, database, and security. However, the human-generated version presented more precise and measurable targets, enabling easier project tracking and evaluation. Moreover, the human-generated version recognized the significance of user adoption and customer satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of meeting user expectations and achieving success in the market. The scope of the project showcased notable differences between the two versions. The AI-generated version provided a comprehensive understanding of the tasks involved in creating the application, implementing features, and launching a marketing campaign. In contrast, the human-generated version included crucial points such as prohibiting physical alterations to locations and mandating professional background checks. By addressing legal and practical considerations, these extra features ensured a more realistic scope. The human-generated project scope version offered a more in-depth and contextualized understanding of the project compared to the AI-generated version, which primarily provided just a summary. The inclusion of market research, precise targets, and scope considerations in the human-generated charter enhanced the project's justification, clarity, and alignment with market needs. Consequently, the human-generated version provides a stronger foundation for successful project planning and execution, as it demonstrates a deeper awareness of the context and objectives. In the scope part of the plan, both the human project manager and the AI made use (and sometimes a mix) of work packages representing deliverables with others representing activities, even though the PMI recommendation (PMI, 2022) is to work with products at the WBS level. The inclusion of project stages in the document created by the human project manager added more specificity that might be useful for project execution and control, even though both scope statements met the requirements for an exhaustive scope statement. Average sub-deliverables per main deliverable were higher for the human project manager's WBS (3.7) than for the AI's WBS (2.8). This shows that, despite the AI's wider scope, the human project manager went a little bit deeper into each significant project phase. Neither approach is inherently superior. The effectiveness of a WBS depends on how well it fits the project's context and the team's working style. A more detailed WBS might be suitable for complex projects where precision is crucial. A broader WBS might be better for projects that require flexibility and team autonomy. In the case of this specific project, both WBS structures seemed comprehensive in covering the scope, considering the initial planned features. The fundamental goal of both WBSs was to divide the project into distinct jobs. The human project manager's WBS displayed a stronger concentration within each main deliverable and highlighted the importance of project management, marketing, and publicity deliverables, whereas the AI-generated WBS presented a broader view with more work packages. Depending on the requirements and settings of a given project, any approach's effectiveness may change. The project was successfully divided into manageable deliverables using both the AI-generated and human-generated WBS dictionaries. The WBS lexicon created by AI offered a more thorough breakdown, covering a wider range of project categories and deliverables. It showed a deeper comprehension of the goals and constraints of the project, but the definition of each deliverable's acceptance criteria was just an AI suggestion based on its understanding of the project scope. The human-generated WBS lexicon, on the other hand, displayed a slightly narrower focus, highlighting the project scope (rather than just the product scope) and important project management elements including scope declaration, budget, schedule, and marketing. It also includes precise deliverables for the validation of prototypes, a description of the architecture, and lessons learned. The specific definition of each deliverable's acceptance criteria provided clear rules for assessing the accomplishment and success of the deliverables. In respect to the RTM, the AI version made evident how requirements relate to certain WBS IDs, allowing for efficient project planning and control. The human-generated matrix did not explicitly divide the requirements into functional and non-functional components, in contrast to the AI-generated matrix, which would have made it easier to distinguish between various project demands. Overall, each strategy has advantages and disadvantages. The human-generated matrix offered a structured and quantitative foundation, whereas the AI-generated matrix showed the possibility for creating comprehensive requirements. The project's traceability and requirement management might be improved by combining the advantages of the two methodologies, resulting in a thorough understanding of the project's requirements and effective prioritization. The differences observed between the AI-generated and human-generated schedules can be attributed to the different strengths and weaknesses inherent in the two methods. The AI-generated schedule leverages machine learning and algorithmic techniques to create a basic timeline based on the given input. While this approach offers simplicity and quick initial planning, it may lack the necessary level of specificity and project context that could be further developed through more refined prompts or inputs. On the other hand, the human-generated schedule benefits from the project manager's experience and domain knowledge, allowing for a more thorough and customized approach. Although both displayed each activity with its respective duration, resources, and costs on a MS-Project format (as demanded on the ChatGPT prompt), the human-generated schedule provided a more accurate and realistic depiction of the project's complexities by considering its unique requirements, resource limitations, and interdependencies. In addition, the human-generated schedule demonstrated more in-depth project control and risk management considerations. By incorporating specific milestones, deliverables, and quality control checkpoints, it established clear points of evaluation and ensured adherence to predetermined criteria. This comprehensive oversight facilitates efficient project management, enabling the identification and mitigation of risks. In contrast, the AI-generated schedule lacked such thorough monitoring systems, which can lead to increased uncertainty and limitations in control. While the AI-generated schedule can serve as a useful starting point for initial planning, it is crucial to recognize its limitations and the need for human participation and refinement. With its greater complexity and attention to detail, the human-generated schedule provides a more solid foundation for project execution, enabling thorough monitoring, control, and risk management throughout the project lifecycle. The choice between the two schedules should be based on the specific needs of the project, available resources, and the desired level of granularity. Careful consideration of the trade-offs between simplicity and complexity is necessary to ensure the suitability of the chosen schedule for the project at hand. The disparity between the AI-generated and human-generated cost estimates is notable in terms of the level of detail and accuracy. The AI-generated estimates offered insights into monthly cost projections and resource utilization, which can be useful for initial planning and high-level cost monitoring. However, it lacked a specific total amount for the overall project, limiting its effectiveness in comprehensive financial planning and evaluation. In contrast, the human-generated cost estimates excelled in providing a comprehensive breakdown and considering various cost elements. The inclusion of specific cost components, such as direct, indirect, fixed, and variable costs, improve financial transparency and accountability. This level of detail enabled accurate budgeting, resource allocation, and cost control throughout the project lifecycle. The human-generated estimates provided stakeholders with a clear understanding of the project's financial scope and impact. This specific total amount serves as a valuable reference for financial evaluation and decision-making. It is also important to link the project cost estimates with the earlier findings in the scope and schedule areas. The comprehensive breakdown of costs by resource in the human-generated estimates aligns with the detailed breakdown of activities and dependencies in the human-generated schedule. The meticulous consideration of direct, indirect, fixed, and variable costs demonstrates a holistic approach to project planning, ensuring that all cost elements are accounted for. This linkage boosts the reliability and accuracy of the project plan, facilitating informed decision-making and effective cost management. The human-generated cost estimates also contribute to the financial planning and control aspects discussed in the scope and schedule sections. By providing stakeholders with a complete understanding of the project's financial implications, the human-generated estimates enable more informed budget allocation and resource management. The specific total amount of $258,606 serves as a benchmark for financial evaluation and ongoing cost monitoring, ensuring that the project remains within budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, given the sensitivity of the cost variable in the context of project management, it would have been interesting, in addition to being a good practice, to prepare a cost baseline, to follow the project budget. Furthermore, both the artificial intelligence (AI)-generated, and human-generated versions of the project plan failed to integrate the contingency and mitigation values derived from the risk plan into the overall project cost plan. Regarding the resource plan, it is important to note that the human-generated version did not specifically take equipment requirements into account. Even considering that the project was about the development of an application and that computing resources can be part of the procurement process (if the option is to outsource the services), considering only the human resources of the project can be a disadvantage. This was the typical case where we understood that further refinement of the generative AI prompt could make all the difference. One may or may not assume that the organization will supply or have access to the essential equipment. In any case, for the purpose of correctly allocating costs and carrying out project activities effectively, it would be important to consider the adequacy and availability of equipment. The resource plan generated by the project manager displayed a higher level of precision and consideration of individual roles and responsibilities in comparison to the AI-generated plan. The project team's accountability and clarity were improved with the addition of the RACI Matrix but to ensure smooth work execution, supplemental equipment considerations could be incorporated into the human-generated plan. The AI-generated version of the quality plan placed a strong emphasis on thorough testing strategies, agile development techniques, and the creation of quality measures to deliver a functional and high-quality application. While early defect identification and automation expedite the quality assurance process, the plan lacks certain components such as auditing, nonconformity handling, and thorough performance monitoring. In contrast, the human-generated quality plan utilized a more comprehensive strategy that considered performance monitoring, nonconformity handling, and auditing, besides testing operations. It recognized the value of compliance, ongoing development, and the application of control measures, resulting in a solid quality management structure that ensured standard compliance and promotes continual improvement. Neither party considered the inclusion of good-known quality assurance practices such as retrospectives or lessons learned. Selecting between the two quality plans requires consideration of the individual requirements and circumstances of the project. While the human-generated plan offers a wider variety of quality control elements, the AI-generated plan provides advantages in terms of efficiency and automation. Combining the strengths of both approaches can lead to an improved quality management strategy that effectively utilizes AI for testing and automation, while incorporating components from the human-generated plan to ensure compliance and promote continual improvement. While the AI-generated plan offered a systematic approach to stakeholder identification and engagement, it may have lacked the depth and detail present in the human-generated plan. The human-generated plan demonstrated a clear concern on the part of the project manager for meeting the expectations of various stakeholders, likely drawing from past project experiences. It encompassed specific stakeholders such as employees' families, NGOs, unions, and opinion leaders, recognizing their potential influence on the project. Additionally, the human-generated plan acknowledged stakeholders outside the immediate project scope, emphasizing the broader social and environmental repercussions of the project. Both plans did not consider the costs and resource impacts of stakeholder engagement in integrating the project plan. Effective communication in project management was recognized as essential in both the AI-generated and human-generated communications plans. The AI-generated plan demonstrated a more concrete and organized approach, with well-defined objectives, channels, messages, schedules, and roles. It utilized contemporary communication methods, such as in-app notifications and community engagement events, to encourage stakeholder interaction and collaboration. In contrast, the human-generated plan employed more traditional strategies, relying on techniques like newsletters, websites, correspondence, presentations, and videos. While these strategies have their merits, they may not fully leverage the capabilities of digital communication platforms and emerging technologies. The AI-generated plan excelled in its comprehensive and systematic approach to stakeholder engagement. It ensured accountability and coordination by clearly defining roles and responsibilities. Regular team meetings and stakeholder workshops provided forums for open discussions and feedback. Although less specific in terms of roles and coordination, the human-generated plan acknowledged the value of diverse communication channels for disseminating information and engaging stakeholders. It placed a particular focus on communication through newsletters, website updates, letters, and presentations, aiming to inform and update stakeholders on the company's operations and customer service levels. Conversely, the AI-generated communications strategy, with its diverse channels and well-defined roles, offered a more thorough and disciplined approach to project communication. It aimed to inform stakeholders, address their concerns, and foster collaboration. On the other hand, the human-generated plan seemed to prioritize conventional communication techniques. Therefore, combining elements from both plans could potentially yield benefits for project planning, incorporating the advantages of contemporary and traditional communication approaches. In terms of project risks, the advantages of a systematic and thorough approach to risk management were highlighted by the comparison of the AI-generated and human-generated risk plans. The AI-generated risk plan demonstrated a comprehensive framework that encompassed all stages of risk management, from identification to response planning. It effectively identified a wide range of potential risks and opportunities, categorizing them into specific domains such as legal/regulatory, technology, market/users, and finance. This classification allowed for a focused understanding of the areas that posed the greatest risks to the project. Moreover, the plan employed qualitative and quantitative assessment to evaluate the probability and impact of risks, facilitating an objective basis for risk prioritization. By considering both threats and opportunities, the AI-generated plan showcased a holistic approach to risk management. On the other hand, the human-generated risk plan focused primarily on risk identification without a comprehensive approach to risk management. While the project manager's experience contributed to identifying risks, the plan lacked the categorization, qualitative and quantitative assessment, and specific response strategies present in the AI-generated plan. The absence of risk response planning hindered the project team's preparedness to address potential challenges, limiting their ability to mitigate negative impacts effectively. On top of that, the human-generated plan failed to consider potential opportunities that could arise during the project, neglecting to capture the full spectrum of risks and rewards. The contrast between the two plans highlights the advantages of an AI-generated approach to risk management, especially in complex projects. The AI-generated plan demonstrated a rigorous and structured framework that integrated risk identification, qualification, quantification, and response planning. This comprehensive approach empowered the project team to effectively understand and address risks, while capitalizing on potential opportunities. The inclusion of risk quantification in the AI-generated plan further improved decision-making and resource allocation, ultimately enhancing project outcomes. 5.2 Practical implications While the human-generated plan may have been limited in some parts of its planning approach (e.g.: risks), it is important to consider that the reasons behind its shortcomings were not investigated in this study. Factors such as time constraints or limited resources may have impacted the project manager's ability to develop a more formalized risk management process. However, the comparison underscores the potential advantages of utilizing an AI-generated strategy as a starting point for project planning, providing a solid foundation and saving time for the project manager to conduct a more in-depth analysis and refinement of the overall plan. These findings suggest that the combination of AI-generated insights with human expertise can create a powerful synergy in planning for a project, ultimately improving the project's chances of success. Another research finding that could be observed during the project plan development was that the iterative process of refining the AI-generated project plan has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving results across various project management expertise areas. Gradually adjusting and clarifying the AI system's instructions enhances the standard and applicability of the outputs produced. The initial prompt serves as a starting point that can be continuously assessed and optimized through later iterations. Project managers can leverage the AI system's ability to create precise and customized project plans by continuously adjusting the input instructions. Research studies by Ekin (2023) and Song et al., 2021 support the notion that providing detailed and explicit information to AI models enhances their capacity to understand desired outcomes and produce results that align with intended requirements. Project managers can ensure that the created project plan includes the necessary elements and fulfills the main project requirements by providing the AI system with detailed input. This all-encompassing approach leads to project plans that are better suited to the project's objectives and constraints, fostering a more productive partnership between human expertise and AI capabilities. 5.3 Societal implications The distinct strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated and human-generated project plans suggest a synergistic approach, combining AI and human input, may optimize the project planning process. For instance, AI models like GPT-4 could rapidly generate a project plan's initial draft, subsequently refined, and customized by a human project manager, thereby enhancing efficiency while ensuring comprehensive consideration of all critical project aspects. Concurrently, the rise of AI in project management demands the development of robust policies and guidelines by organizations and governing bodies, addressing key issues such as data privacy, ethical AI use, and responsible AI application. Societally, the increasing capabilities of AI models pose potential challenges, including job displacement in the project management field. However, this study underscores the complementary nature of the strengths and weaknesses of AI and human project managers, suggesting a collaborative rather than replacement-based approach may be most effective. This has far-reaching implications for the education and training of future project managers, necessitating a curriculum that equips them to collaborate effectively with AI. 6 Research limitations and future considerations The research offers valuable insights into the realm of project management, effectively juxtaposing human expertise with AI capabilities. The study approached data handling with due diligence, laying the foundation for a nuanced understanding of project planning in the age of AI. As with any pioneering research, there are avenues that present opportunities for deeper exploration in future iterations. A more detailed exposition on data governance, integrity, and management within project frameworks can further enhance the discourse. Also, while the goal of this study was to compare project plans made by human project managers and those made by AI, it is vital to recognize some limitations that may restrict the applicability and scope of the results. For instance, using a single project plan limits the capacity to draw general conclusions about the effectiveness of project plans created by humans or artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of circumstances and contexts. The findings may be influenced by the unique characteristics of the selected project, the expertise of the human project manager, and the specific training and data utilized by the AI system. Besides, due to the small sample size, care must be taken when extrapolating the findings to populations other than the project chosen and research subjects. Also, the unique circumstances, project requirements, and characteristics of the human project manager may not be representative of other project management scenarios, industries, and organizational settings. The choice of a particular project plan and a human project manager may have also unintentionally introduced biases that may have impacted the findings of the investigation. Future research should aim to overcome these limitations by including a larger sample size of project plans. A broader range of projects and diverse human project managers should be considered to provide more robust and generalizable insights into the comparison between AI-generated project plans and those created by human project managers. It's also important to note that the rapidly evolving capabilities of generative AI models suggest that they will become increasingly valuable in the project planning process, potentially altering the comparative strengths and weaknesses identified in this study. Therefore, while this study presents a comprehensive comparison between a human project manager and the GPT-4 model, the findings could quickly become outdated as newer, more advanced models are developed. Another limitation to highlight within our research methodology concerns the depth of our evaluation of AI-generated responses. While we did consider multiple responses from the AI system and experimented with various prompts, our analysis primarily centered on a select response for each prompt. It's widely recognized in the realm of generative AI that these systems can yield a spectrum of responses to a single prompt. Such outputs can sometimes bear resemblance, but there are instances where they substantially differ, leading to alternative perspectives or interpretations. Although our study incorporated a range of responses and prompt variations, a more exhaustive exploration might reveal further nuances in the AI's outputs. Additionally, while the study touched upon auditing and monitoring, an in-depth exploration of the associated ethical implications, especially considering AI's growing role and the interests of diverse stakeholders, could add another layer of depth. These considerations, particularly from an ethical standpoint, are essential as we navigate the complexities of integrating AI in project outcomes and their implications for various stakeholders. As the field evolves, subsequent research endeavors can build upon these foundations, continuing the quest for a holistic understanding of the synergy between human and AI in project management. 7 Conclusion In examining the comparison between an AI-generated and a human-created project plan, this study found that both have unique strengths and weaknesses, suggesting a collaborative approach may be optimal. AI-generated plans serve as efficient starting points, often introducing novel insights, especially in areas like risk management. However, they should not be viewed as final deliverables. Human expertise remains vital for validating and refining these AI outputs. A human project manager's domain knowledge, understanding of industry standards, and best practices make them uniquely qualified to provide context and address potential gaps in AI-generated plans. While AI, particularly generative models like GPT-4, can rapidly produce initial drafts, human oversight ensures alignment with organizational goals, stakeholder expectations, and project constraints. The \u201chuman in the loop\u201d approach effectively bridges the nuances of project planning with AI outputs, underscoring the complementary nature of AI and human capabilities in this domain. Prompt engineering emerged as a critical factor in optimizing AI's utility. By refining prompts, human project managers can guide AI outputs to be more contextually relevant and precise. However, over-reliance on AI introduces risks. Technically, AI models can produce outputs that might not be contextually appropriate or may overlook industry-specific nuances. Moreover, solely AI-centric project management might neglect vital human-centric aspects like team leadership and alignment with organizational values. In summary, while AI has immense potential to augment project planning, the pivotal role of human expertise remains undeniable. A balanced integration of both AI and human capabilities ensures efficient, comprehensive, and nuanced project plans. Organizations and stakeholders must recognize and harness this synergy for effective project management.

photovoltaic cells and connected sequentially (in series) using unipolar cables to constitute photovoltaic strings. These panels or modules are equipped with secure elements located inside the junction box and power components inside the static converter. Figure 1 Figure 2 Example of a bibliometric network represented graphically, consisting of various nodes and lines. Each node is assigned a number and a color, which correspond to different entities based on the type of study conducted. The number represents the size of the node, indicating the proportion of entities sharing similar attributes. Nodes with the same color are grouped together, indicating high affinities and forming clusters. The lines in the graph represent the connections between nodes. The thickness and spacing of the circles on the lines reflect the intensity of the affinity between two nodes. A thicker line and closer circles indicate a stronger connection between entities. A higher number associated with a line confirms that the links between two entities are highly intensive.

Conventional fault detection methods in photovoltaic systems face limitations when dealing with emerging monitoring systems that produce vast amounts of high-dimensional data across various domains. Accordingly, great interest appears within the international scientific community for the application of artificial intelligence methods, which are seen as a highly promising solution for effectively managing large datasets for detecting faults. In this review, more than 620 papers published since 2010 on artificial intelligence methods for detecting faults in photovoltaic systems are analyzed. To extract major research trends, in particular to detect most promising algorithms and approaches overcoming excessive time calculations, a conventional bibliographic survey would have been extremely difficult to complete. That is why this study proposes to carry out a review with an innovative approach based on a statistical method named Bibliometric and a Expert qualitative content analysis. This methodology consists of three stages. First, a collection of data from databases is carried out with all precautions to achieve a large, robust, high-quality database. Second, multiple bibliometric indicators are chosen based on the objectives to be achieved and analyzed to assess their real impact, such as the quantity and nature of publications, collaborative connections among organizations, researchers, and countries or most cited articles. Finally, the Expert qualitative content analysis carried out by experts identifies the current and emerging research topics that have the greatest impact on fault detection in photovoltaic systems using artificial intelligence. Graphical abstract Keywords Photovoltaic (PV) Fault diagnosis Machine learning Artificial intelligence Research trends Renewable energy Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction The need to reduce and replace fossil fuels has led to a significant increase in alternative energy production, coupled with a serious reduction in the cost of designing, installing, and maintaining photovoltaic (PV) systems. To be effective, these systems must be scalable, making them competitive as a mature energy solution on the market [1]. In addition, in the past few years, harnessing solar energy through photovoltaic electrical production has been acknowledged as the most efficient method for generating power from the environment [2]. Photovoltaic energy is essential to promote social transformation and long-term economic development [3]. However, despite steady progress in emerging technologies regarding efficiency [4], the continuity of production of these various systems encounters a major obstacle because faults are frequently present. Moreover, the time required to detect and resolve these faults can be more than one week, leading to significant production losses [5]. For example, in 2018, the loss of production due to faults and degradation was estimated at 17.5% of the total energy production [6]. In the worst case, some of these faults deteriorate photovoltaic systems at a rate of 0.8% per year, while others can even cause discontinuity in the production of a part or the entire system [7]. Like other power plants, photovoltaic systems are susceptible to faults in any of their components. The fundamental building block of a photovoltaic system is a solar cell, which serves as the active element responsible for converting sunlight directly into electricity. Solar cells have the option to be linked either in a series or in parallel with basic electrical protections such as bypass diodes to form a complete photovoltaic module. To ensure long-term functionality, solar cells are encapsulated in a secure environment with additional protection, known as a photovoltaic module [8]. Furthermore, photovoltaic modules can be interconnected to create a photovoltaic string (where modules are connected in series) or a photovoltaic array (where multiple strings are connected in parallel) [9,10]. Photovoltaic power plants are made up of one or more photovoltaic arrays, equipped with protection diodes called anti-reverse diodes and conventional electrical converters that allow connection to local grids or loads. Finally, a complete photovoltaic system can be complex, particularly in large-scale power plants. Various architectural approaches exist for assembling arrays in parallel to increase current and reduce the number of components in power converters. Alternatively, additional power electronics can be introduced to ensure continuity of production and achieve the desired power output and reliability for photovoltaic installation [8]. These elements and their respective electrical connections can be clearly observed in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 illustrates a photovoltaic system that corresponds to one of the most widely used configurations, called the series-parallel configuration. There are other configurations as well, such as Ridge Linked or Total Cross Tied configurations [11]. The selection of a particular configuration is influenced by a range of factors. For instance, despite the fact that the total cross-tied and bridge link configurations exhibit superior power performance compared to the series-parallel configuration, their limited economic feasibility has hindered their widespread adoption [12]. Numerous research studies suggest several comprehensive approaches to design a photovoltaic installation adapted to specific situations, showcasing the depth of knowledge in this scientific domain. Given the complexity of the structures of the photovoltaic system, faults can be caused by various factors such as deterioration of photovoltaic cells or their environment, including cell cracks, overheating, moisture penetration, degradation of interconnections, and corrosion of the connections between cells [13\u201334]. Similarly, faults in other parts of photovoltaic systems can be originated by issues such as broken encapsulation, short or open circuits, problems with junction boxes and other secure functions, or faulty inverter modules [14,20,24,27,35\u201350]. At the array level, faults such as ground, line to line, or arc can occur, especially in photovoltaic plants with a capacity exceeding 100 kWp [51\u201367]. Faults also often occur in the junction box, which can be induced due to other faults such as short circuits, damage or corrosion of connections, or open circuits [20,27,40,49,68\u201373]. Furthermore, faults can also be attributed to diodes used as security components, either due to improper implementation (e.g., diode polarity reversal during assembly, poorly connected or omitted diodes) or electrical destruction during various operations [20,49,52,65,74\u201376]. Detecting faults, regardless of their nature or origin, is crucial for the preventive or corrective maintenance of photovoltaic systems [77]. However, distinguishing between an actual fault and a mere lack of production becomes challenging due to the influence of meteorological conditions [58] and the continuous changes in operating conditions, as well as the presence or absence of maximum power point tracking devices [54]. Indeed, there exist numerous scenarios in this field where the electrical behavior of faulty panels closely resembles that of panels without any faults [3,78,79]. A comprehensive analysis of fault characteristics and the significance of detecting faults at an early stage is presented in reference [80]. Currently, the choice of appropriate methods for identifying faults relies on factors such as the type of the fault (line-line, short circuit, open circuit, hot spot, partial shadow, etc.). The complexity of the problem significantly increases when multiple faults need to be monitored by the same system using the same algorithm, especially when the faults occur intermittently and manifest so rapidly that they cannot be detected [81]. Therefore, there is a need to improve existing strategies to develop more efficient systems with online predictive fault detection capabilities applicable across a broad spectrum of solar or photovoltaic systems. Taking into account the numerous factors that influence the fault detection processes in photovoltaic (PV) systems, several authors have proposed conventional reviews as a means to understand current fault detection research in photovoltaic systems [1,37,39,45,66,69,82\u201393]. These reviews highlight the rapid replacement of conventional fault detection methods with artificial intelligence-based approaches. This change is attributed to the limitations of conventional methods, such as infrared/thermography [94\u201397], ultrasound inspection [98,99], electroluminescence imaging [100\u2013102], and lock-in thermography [103,104]. These conventional methods struggle to handle the substantial amounts of multidomain data collected by new photovoltaic monitoring systems (including electrical, thermal, environmental, historical, and technical data). Additionally, conventional methods were designed to detect specific types of faults in photovoltaic systems, and some even require photovoltaic panels to be disconnected, halting overall photovoltaic production. Furthermore, conventional systems are challenging to reconfigure to detect other types of fault or the same fault under varying test conditions. Even conventional detection methods, such as visual inspection [98,105\u2013107], are highly relying on human observers, making them quite subjective. Despite offering valuable insights into the research landscape, these state of the art reviews possess notable limitations, which have motivated the objectives of this study. The main objective of this research is to create a comprehensive review that can serve as a fundamental resource for the advancement of future studies and potential policies aimed at enhancing energy efficiency. To achieve this, the study not only explores some of the most representative articles on fault diagnosis in photovoltaic systems using artificial intelligence, but also categorizes them based on the principle of the algorithm used. Additionally, this research provides a synopsis of upcoming studies, with the goal of streamlining the research process by quickly identifying major contributors, publications, journals, research facilities, and countries within the relevant field. All of these aspects accelerate the beginning of research efforts and even aid in the selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms based on specific application conditions. Academic institutions generally use two research strategies to comprehend the latest developments: quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative research involves the analysis of numerical data (for example, statistics), while qualitative research delves into non-numerical data, such as language, to study concepts, establish hypotheses, or interpret patterns. However, a comprehensive understanding of the current state of a given field requires the simultaneous use of both research strategies. For this reason, in order to further develop this comprehensive review of the state of the art, this study introduces an innovative hybrid methodology (combining qualitative and quantitative approaches) for analyzing and identifying promising and cutting-edge research topics in artificial intelligence for photovoltaic fault detection, with potential applicability in other domains. The proposed methodology combines bibliometric analysis (statistical analysis interpreted as a quantitative analysis) and expert qualitative content analysis to assess the latest developments. This approach allows identification of research gaps, trends, collaboration networks, prolific authors, and notable publications in the field. It also aims to detect emerging promising topics and propose new areas of research. Furthermore, this methodology not only identifies documents that use artificial intelligence for photovoltaic fault detection, but also groups them based on similarities in the algorithms used in each research. To our understanding, this approach has never been utilized in the field of artificial intelligence to detect faults in photovoltaic systems before. This study makes multiple contributions. Firstly, it introduces a hybrid methodology capable of analyzing large amounts of existing information in the literature to discover hidden relationships and new research trends objectively. Secondly, the proposed methodology can identify the family (analogical, connectionist, evolutionary, symbolic, regression and Bayesian) to which the machine learning algorithms used in each photovoltaic system fault diagnosis article belong. Thirdly, this study also presents a compilation of the most used algorithms for each machine learning family, along with the corresponding number of associated articles. Fourthly, this study not only explores articles addressing the issue of fault detection in photovoltaic systems, but also presents the journals, authors, countries and laboratories with the greatest impact in this area. Fifthly, the study outlines a set of key aspects for the selection and development of efficient machine learning algorithms tailored for photovoltaic system fault diagnosis. Sixth, it highlights a range of aspects related to data monitoring in photovoltaic systems that significantly improve the performance of fault detection algorithms and facilitate their integration into commercial systems. Lastly, the seventh contribution of this study lies in demonstrating the need to construct a formal fault dictionary to solve the challenge of effective fault labeling in photovoltaic systems. This study follows the following structure: Section 2 introduces the motivation behind this study. Section 3 presents the related work and methodology. Section 4 covers data collection. Section 5 focuses on bibliometric analysis. Section 6 presents the analysis of qualitative content from experts. Section 7 highlights promising research topics. Section 8 discusses challenges. Finally, Section 9 provides the discussion and conclusions drawn from the review analysis. 2 Motivation As mentioned in this study, numerous review documents are available on various fault detection methods in photovoltaic systems [1,37,39,45,66,69,82\u201393]. However, these reviews use conventional state of the art review methodologies that have certain limitations. Firstly, algorithms are mainly compared based on their accuracy value in fault detection. This presents an issue as it must be considered that not all machine learning algorithms are trained under the same conditions. In other words, different datasets, weather conditions, and photovoltaic technologies are used, among others. These conditions vary depending on the specific application for which machine learning algorithms are used. Secondly, none of the reviews emphasize evaluating algorithms separately based on the availability of fault labels. A label can be understood as a term that characterizes a specific fault behavior, such as \u201csnail trail\u201d, \u201cbroken glass\u201d, \u201chot spot\u201d, among others. The challenge of assigning labels for accurate fault diagnosis in energy generation systems is one of the main current challenges, as it requires multiple field tests and experts who can accurately, unambiguously, and robustly extract specific fault characteristics. It is this information that allows for accurate fault diagnosis. Not addressing this issue increases the difficulty for researchers in making decisions about the appropriate algorithm for each specific application based on the available data. Third, subjective factors cannot be completely eliminated when selecting studies for conventional reviews, often leading to the exclusion of important studies [108]. At times, the selection process lacks transparency or authors take a subjective approach when identifying emerging research topics. Fourth, many times, these reviews fail to provide the necessary discussion and information for academic and industry communities, which hinders the recognition of crucial authors, organizations, countries, documents, sources, and keywords. Furthermore, the timely detection of emerging research domains becomes a challenge, limiting our understanding of prior scientific endeavors and potential academic research. Moreover, the advancement of scientific development and technological innovation is also impeded. Fifth, these studies fail to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence to handle multivariate data of high dimensions and extract hidden relationships within complex and dynamic environments such as BIG DATA [109]. The motivation behind conducting this study, which offers significant theoretical contributions to the field of fault detection in photovoltaic systems and energy management, is to attempt to provide a novel solution to the five limitations of conventional reviews, along with the observed concerns in the field. 3 Related work and methodology As mentioned in Section 2, the methodologies have limitations due to the human capacity required to analyze numerous documents accurately and impartially. Consequently, it becomes challenging to provide a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the conceptual and intellectual framework of a scientific field, emerging research areas, or collaboration networks. Bibliometrics, on the other hand, is a valuable tool that can address the subjectivity issues encountered in conventional state of the art reviews. Additionally, this tool enables the mapping of collaboration networks, emerging research areas, and relevant technological fields. References such as [110\u2013113] highlight the capabilities of bibliometrics in quantitative analysis. Using computer engineering, database management, and statistical techniques, bibliometrics organizes, explores, and analyzes large volumes of information (Big Data) in a structured manner. It can accomplish tasks that are impossible to be analyzed by human capacities alone [114]. A formal definition of bibliometrics is provided in [115]. Moreover, bibliometrics facilitates the decision-making process and the prediction of emerging technologies [116\u2013118]. The treatment of big data using Bibliometric follows a well-defined protocol. It involves translating the analysis into nodes, links between nodes, and networks with varying potential. This graphical representation is particularly suitable for engineering and research applications [119]. Visualizing the results of the analysis using bibliometric, based on the principle of nodes and networks, is called a bibliometric map or network. Fig. 2 presents an example schematic to illustrate how the results of an analysis can be represented using a Bibliometric map. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of a network of 10 nodes. Each node represents a size and is represented by circles, with the circle size proportional to the number of entities sharing similar attributes, indicated by the value inside the node. Each cluster is denoted by a different color. The thickness of the lines connecting the nodes is proportional to the corresponding value on the line, while the spacing between the circles represents the intensity of collaboration. As mentioned in [120], this type of bibliometric analysis and visualization has become an indispensable tool for measuring scientific progress in various scientific fields, with different applications and degrees of collaboration [121\u2013123]. Specifically, in the field of solar energy, bibliometrics is widely used in areas such as organic solar cells [118,124], energy transition [125], rooftop photovoltaic fields [108], analysis of different Maximum Power Point Tracking methods [126], and more generally [113,118,120,124,127\u2013132]. These studies demonstrate the significant potential of bibliometrics to identify emerging research fields through statistical analysis of article keywords. However, to improve the interpretability of topics derived from bibliometric analysis, it is necessary to conduct expert-supervised qualitative content analysis [133]. Currently, these tools serve as valuable supplements to provide a more accurate and unbiased overview of the current state of research in the field. The main advantage of using these tools lies in their ability to explore and uncover hidden topics within large amounts of textual data [134\u2013137]. Therefore, the content analysis strategy used in this study focuses on topics and involves analyzing the most relevant articles within each topic, as determined by the number of citations received by each article. This approach provides more detailed insights into each topic [138]. One of the main contributions of this research resides in its capacity to tackle the issues discussed. To achieve this, the study proposes a novel hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis and expert qualitative content analysis. This methodology is implemented in several stages, as shown in Fig. 3 . As seen in Fig. 3, the proposed methodology consists of four steps or stages. The first stage is called Data Collection, where documents related to the studied areas are retrieved from databases such as Scopus and WoS. The aim of the initial phase is to construct a data corpus containing all the relevant information for automatically determining hidden relationships. In the second stage, known as Bibliometric Analysis, these documents are processed to extract relevant information, including emerging trends, highly cited documents, collaboration networks, keywords, and more. The results of the bibliographic analysis are then analyzed in the third stage, which involves an Expert Qualitative Content Analysis. This analysis helps in forming a comprehensive overview of the use of artificial intelligence for fault detection in photovoltaic systems and can be divided into two main parts. The first part of the results corresponds to the output of a methodology called Promising Research Topics in this study. This outcome highlights new research trends in fault detection using artificial intelligence. Furthermore, these results of promising research topics can be used to further apply the same proposed methodology. The second part of the Expert Qualitative Content Analysis is called Challenges. It covers the obstacles that hinder the progress of research in this field and are closely associated with the promising topics mentioned earlier. It is important to mention that this study was guided by a simplified version of the PRISMA 2020 standard [139], which has been used in works such as [140]. In general, the PRISMA standard comprises four phases: (i) identification of the need for review, (ii) definition of a search protocol, (iii) performance of the review, and(iv) analysis of the review. The identification of the need for review was described in the Introduction. Sections (ii) \u2013 (iv) are contained within the sections Data Collection, Bibliometric Analysis and Expert Qualitative Content Analysis. The respective stages of the methodology and their results are presented in detail in the following. 4 Data collection stage To ensure dependable conclusions during the construction of a wide range of state of the art [141], it is essential to have a data corpus that exhibits adequate accuracy and robustness. With this consideration in mind, the data collection stage has been conducted following the framework presented in Fig. 4 . In the studied area, the data collection stage was applied on May 03, 2022. Initially, a group of documents was retrieved from widely used databases for bibliometric studies, namely Scopus and Web of Science [142,143]. These databases provide data from studies carried out over a longer period compared to other databases [144]. To perform this initial retrieval, a search equation was constructed using the following keywords: \u201cPV\u201d, \u201cPhotovoltaic\u201d, \u201cFault\u201d, \u201cFailure\u201d, \u201cAnomaly\u201d, \u201cDetection\u201d, \u201cDiagnosis\u201d, \u201cClassification\u201d, \u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d, and \u201cMachine learning\u201d. The search equation was configured with Boolean operators, as indicated in part a of Fig. 4. Construction of the search equation using keywords is considered one of the best methods to initiate a systematic search [145]. The second step of the data collection stage involved performing the search for each document title, abstract, and keywords. As a result, an additional group of documents was retrieved from both Scopus (262 documents) and Web of Science (205 documents). Duplicate documents were eliminated using Zotero software [146]. In the third step, a set of documents from other databases was added, peer-reviewed for relevance, to the initial group, resulting in a total of 671 documents. The distribution of these documents retrieved over the years is presented in Fig. 5 . The sample concludes in May 2022, so as shown in Fig. 5, the total number of publications for that year may not provide conclusive results. As observed in the same figure, the research development in the field of \u201cfault detection in photovoltaic systems using artificial intelligence\u201d can be divided into two distinct periods. The first period commenced in 2002 with the initial publication focusing on fault detection of high impedance arc faults in transmission lines utilizing the wavelet transform [147]. Although documents published during this period did not use AI techniques, these studies on photovoltaic faults marked the inception of interest in fault detection in electrical generation and transmission systems, as well as the utilization of signal processing for feature extraction in fault detection. This first period can be estimated to extend until 2015 when the number of publications experienced a significant surge, reaching 4.5 times the number of publications in 2015 by 2022. This drastic increase is associated with the global interest in a clean energy transition and the necessity to replace fossil fuel sources to mitigate climate change issues and achieve carbon neutrality through more robust and reliable energy production systems. Therefore, it is expected that this exponential growth will continue in the coming decades, underscoring the importance of conducting studies such as the one presented here. The distribution of the 671 documents retrieved by document type is presented in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 6, most of the documents recovered consist of scientific conference papers and journal articles. While these categories contain valuable documents, it should be noted that some of them are written in languages other than English, which poses challenges in their analysis. To ensure the construction of a relevant and cohesive study corpus, this study proposes the application of a set of inclusion criteria for filtering the retrieved documents, as outlined in Table 1 . The objective of this fourth step is to selectively retain documents that meet the following criteria: they must be written in English, originate from reputable scientific journals or conferences, and have been published from 2010 onward. This filtering step is conducted based on the hypothesis that the use of a set of inclusion criteria will select only relevant, recent, peer-reviewed information with comparable results. The purpose of this additional stage is to improve the consistency and reliability of the results obtained initially through Bibliometric analysis. After applying the filter criteria, a total of 620 peer-reviewed documents are selected. These documents form a comprehensive group, which constitutes the final data corpus for this study (fifth step). The filtering process, applied to the subsequent Expert qualitative content analysis, ensures a structured, replicable, transparent, and iterative study by eliminating documents that are not relevant to the objective of the study [148]. Once the data corpus is complete, a bibliometric analysis process can be conducted. 5 Bibliometric analysis Bibliometric analysis allows for an objective and replicable review of a data corpus. This method is used to analyze various indicators such as authors, countries, citations, and keywords, enabling the quantitative assessment of different aspects within a specific field of knowledge [149\u2013151]. Consequently, Bibliometrics facilitates the identification of popular topics in the present, past, or future [152]. Therefore, it serves as a crucial tool to review the state of the art in a research field, covering both micro-level analysis involving individual scientists and institutes, as well as macro-level analysis on national and global scales [112,130]. However, not every database of scientific publications can be directly used for this type of bibliometric analysis. It is crucial that the databases are structured and devoid of duplicated publications, variations in author name spellings, and ideally include fields such as article title, authors, journal, publication year, citation count, institutions, countries, keywords, and bibliographic references. The results of Bibliometric analysis can be visualized through maps or networks. In this context, the closeness between two elements signifies the intensity of their connection. A reduced distance signifies a more robust relationship. In these maps, the elements are unevenly distributed in space, which facilitates the assignment of labels. An example of such representation is presented in Fig. 2. There are two main approaches for creating Bibliometric maps: distance-based methods and graphic-based methods. Different distance-based map construction techniques can be found in the literature. One of the most widely utilized methods within the field of bibliometrics is introduced in [153]. This technique suggests using multidimensional scaling entities to represent proximities between objects within a geometric space of a few dimensions [154]. Alternatively, techniques such as visualization of similarities (VOS) viewer are also proposed [155\u2013157], which have shown better results compared to multidimensional scaling [158]. Another distance-based technique, called V x O r d is proposed in [159,160], and has demonstrated high performance in the construction of maps with large numbers of elements (7000 or more). Finally, a new method implemented in a software called BibTechMon is proposed in [161]. It is difficult to determine the advantages or disadvantages between them, it is necessary to mention that their biggest difference is the visual complexity to interpret the results. Therefore, depending on the number of elements (articles, authors, countries) some of these approaches may be more or less adequate. Similarly, several works have been published on the elaboration of graph-based maps. In [162], the authors propose constructing graphs using the Euclidean distance between nodes or vertices as the \u201cgraph-theoretical\u201d distance. The vertices are then connected by springs of calculated distances, and the arrangement of vertices is determined on the basis of the total elastic energy of the system. Another technique proposed in [163] aims to achieve uniform edge lengths by modifying the spring embedding model using an analogy with forces in natural systems. Some authors [164,165] combine the work presented in [162] with the pathfinder network technique [166]. There are also software versions such as CiteSpace [167], specialized in this type of maps, and software such as Pajek from [168], which combines distance-based and graph-based approaches. For the bibliometric analysis conducted in the photovoltaic research area, a distance-based bibliometric mapping was performed using VOSviewer, a bibliometric visualization and mapping software developed by Nees Jan Van Eck and Ludo Waltman. 1 1 See Vosviewer. VOSviewer was chosen for its interesting distance-based bibliometric results [158] and its widespread use in the field of bibliometrics [169\u2013172]. Bibliometric maps generated using VOSviewer offer a comprehensive means of assessing relationships and their strengths among distinct entities (authors, laboratories, countries, etc.). To perform the bibliometric analysis, three steps are involved. First, the similarity matrix based on the co-occurrence matrix is computed. Then, a map is created using the VOS mapping technique applied to the similarity matrix. In the end, the map undergoes translation, rotation, and reflection to guarantee uniform outcomes. The similarity matrix is calculated by normalizing the co-occurrence matrix. The choice of normalization metric depends on the total number of occurrences or cooccurrences of elements. To achieve correct normalization, a suitable similarity metric must be selected. The most common normalization metrics include cosine similarity [173] and Jaccard index [174]. However, VOSviewer employs a similarity metric known as the strength of association [156,157], the proximity index [175,176], or the probabilistic affinity index [177], due to its advantages over other similarity measures [178]. In these cases, the similarity \u03b1 m n between two elements m and n is defined in Equation (1): (1) \u03b1 m n = \u03c6 m n \u03a9 m \u03a9 n where \u03c6 m n denotes the count of occurrences where items m and n appear together. Meanwhile, \u03a9 m and \u03a9 n stand for the overall frequency of individual occurrences or the combined occurrences of items m and n, assuming that the occurrences of these items are statistically uncorrelated. After the creation of the similarity matrix, the VOS mapping technique is implemented. It is worth mentioning that the VOS technique can yield one or multiple solutions of global optimum. In cases where multiple solutions exist, it is important to use translation, rotation, or reflection operations to ensure that consistent results are generated by VOSviewer. The procedure for creating a network entails using input data in the format of bibliographic database files, such as those from sources such as Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, Lens, and PubMed [179]. Additionally, reference manager files, which cover formats such as RIS, EndNote, and RefWorks, can also serve as input for the network creation process in VOSviewer [179]. Other formats can be computationally adjusted to be comprehensible by VOSviewer. Further details about this method can be found in [153,179]. In bibliometrics, there are multiple aspects that can be useful for the quantitative and objective evaluation of the impactful input of a researcher or a research team. According to the work presented in [180], these aspects can be categorized into groups such as: scientific activity indicators cover indicators related to scientific production and influence, collaborative efforts, dissemination and production. However, the most commonly used indicators are those of scientific production and collaboration [181]. In the area of scientific production metrics, several key indicators can be identified, including the \u201ctotal number of publications\u201d, the \u201cCrown indicator\u201d and the \u201cH-index\u201d and their variations. The total number of publications mainly takes into account the large number of articles generated. However, it has the drawback of not taking into account factors such as the number of authors, the inclusion of articles in indexed journals, the number of citations received or the specific nature of the articles. The Crown indicator, also named field-normalized citation score [182], seeks to address variations in citation numbers across scientific areas and years of publication [183]. However, a major challenge lies in the inappropriate categorization of articles within specific fields, which often occurs when articles published in general journals are misclassified, thus not contributing to the index calculation. This indicator is also affected by the size of the research group, since the larger the group, the greater the number of group publications. Therefore, some studies recommend its use only when comparing research teams with an equivalent quantity of participants [181]. The \u201cH-index\u201d, which is the third index, functions as a measure of productivity for authors, departments, research groups, or universities operating in the same or closely related research areas within a given country [184]. It is worth noting that the \u201cH-index\u201d should be employed in conjunction with other metrics to obtain a comprehensive understanding of research progress in a particular field, due to its two main limitations. First, the \u201cH-index\u201d is time-dependent and does not provide real-time information about the current production of an author or dynamic information about their productivity. Second, when multiple authors participate, it is difficult to accurately assess their individual contributions to each article, since all authors receive the same credit. As mentioned in [182], various other bibliometric metrics are available for examining scientific output, including the g-index, h(2)-index, contemporary h-index, and more. These metrics or indicators can be employed to assess authors, institutions, or countries. What all of those metrics share is the requirement for complementary metrics to ensure an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the findings. Collaboration indicators assess researcher interaction, with calculations possible at individual, institutional, or national levels. Despite numerous studies on motivations and barriers to inter institutional collaboration, the current literature lacks comprehensive insights into participation preferences of individual researchers in various collaborative projects [185]. Some hypotheses suggest that the prominence of these collaboration indicators arises from the need to address complex scientific problems or innovative technologies through joint efforts involving researchers, institutions, organizations, and diverse communities. Collaboration occurs across disciplinary, interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and national/international levels [186]. Collaborative research offers benefits such as cross-disciplinary idea exchange, skill acquisition, funding access, improved result quality, and transformative outcomes. These advantages significantly drive collaborative growth and industry support for academia [187,188]. In more recent times, thanks to the emergence of advanced computational tools, the utilization of keyword-based co-occurrence analysis has become increasingly prominent. Many authors advocate the use of keyword analysis to expose the relative popularity of research topics within a particular field [189\u2013191]. For this study, and without loss of generality, the bibliometric analysis is conducted on three major categories that have been previously used in the literature and have shown high performance in identifying the state of the art in a research area [192\u2013195]. The three categories are: (i) Co-authorship, (ii) Citation analysis, and (iii) Co-occurrence, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . The study of co-authorship, citation analysis, and co-occurrence networks has a rich history of yielding fascinating results in the field of Bibliometric. The origins of these studies can be linked to the 1960s and 1970s [196\u2013198]. In reference to the analysis of citations, it is important to distinguish between self-citations and citations from other studies that are not directly related to the cited document. In this study, a deliberate decision was made to differentiate between these two types of citations and exclude self-citations from the citation analysis. The bibliographical analysis in this study commences with an exploration of co-authorship. 5.1 Co-authorship In this part of the analysis, specific choices were made regarding co-authorship. Firstly, self-citations were not taken into account, and secondly, publications with more than 12 authors were excluded. This decision was based on the observation that publications with many authors often represent comprehensive reviews of the state of the art or serve as compilations of previously published works. These publications may contain general information rather than specific scientific contributions. Thus, these choices were made to reduce redundancy in information and exclude documents with less scientific value. Moreover, in the area of bibliometrics, there exists a significant challenge when it comes to attributing co-authored publications to individual authors. Various strategies have been suggested to address this issue [199,200]. Among these strategies, two are methods particularly popular: the full counting [201] and the fractional counting [202,203]. These techniques are commonly employed in the creation of bibliometric networks [201]. To demonstrate the disparity between these two approaches when applied to a bibliometric co-authoring network, an example is provided. Consider an article that has been published with six authors. The complete counting method gives each connection between the six coauthors a weight of one, indicating an equal contribution from each. In contrast, the fractional counting method assigns a weight of 1/6 to each connection, reflecting the proportional contribution of each coauthor to the publication. In a co-authoring bibliometric network, the thickness of the connections (links) between two nodes, representing authors, is determined by the co-authoring link value. The size of every node is dictated by the quantity of documents authored by the individual author. In this review, all analyses were conducted using the complete counting method. However, it is important to note that the VOSviewer software provides both complete and fractional counting methods [153]. After analyzing the data corpus, a total of 804 distinct authors who have published at least one article related to the topic of interest were identified, following the extraction of documents involving 12 authors or more. The information presented in Table 2 outlines the correlation between the quantity of authors and the quantity of research papers published in the domain of fault detection employing artificial intelligence in photovoltaic power generation systems. As illustrated in the co-authoring bibliometric analysis shown in Table 2, there is a notable decline in the number of authors. For instance, in the field of photovoltaics, the author count decreases from 620 individuals with a single publication to 96 authors with two publications, and further diminishes to 27 authors with three publications. Furthermore, the impact of an additional analysis that enforces a minimum requirement of 10 citations is evident in the third column of the same table. This requirement highlights the most scientifically significant papers, resulting in only 10 authors with more than four publications and over 10 citations. It is worth noting that, among these authors with four or more publications, the number of authors remains consistent after filtering, indicating that they also have 10 or more citations within the period between 2010 and 2022. Importantly, a pretreatment analysis was conducted when creating the data corpus to address instances in which the authors signed their documents with different initials. This analysis is crucial to avoid errors that may arise from considering such cases as separate authors by the software. In order to create and assess co-authorship networks, we established a minimum criterion of two publications for each author, leading to a foundation of 96 authors. To delve deeper into meaningful connections, partnerships, or clusters of individuals highlighted by the collective dynamics of the networks, we computed the cumulative strength of co-authorship connections with other authors. The top 10 authors, identified by their substantial citation impact or the number of connections, are presented in Table 3 . Another piece of information comes to light with this bibliometric approach, which was able to identify, as shown in Table 3, that the four authors, namely Chen Z, Cheng S, Lin P, and Wu L, have an equal number of publications (6) and also share the highest number of citations (373). This suggests that these four authors have a strong connection and generally collaborate closely. In order to further analyze this, a bibliometric map was constructed to highlight important collaborative networks among authors. The bibliometric map analysis, as depicted in Fig. 8 , demonstrates that only 24 authors have participated in long-term collaborations. Furthermore, the figure illustrates the existence of four separate clusters that are interconnected, signifying four networks and their corresponding collaborative efforts. It is worth noting that the close association observed among the first four authors in Table 3 forms a significant cluster (shown in blue in the figure), validating their strong co-authorship links and their collaborations with the wider scientific community. The authors excluded from Fig. 8 are likely those who have referenced other authors but have only one publication within the specific field under study. Indeed, each author represented in this map must have more than 2 published articles. This visual data is valuable for researchers and academics exploring fault detection in photovoltaic systems with artificial intelligence, offering a distinct overview of key authors in this domain and the interconnections depicted through citations. Likewise, it is interesting to examine the establishments associated with the most influential authors in the field of interest and the connections among them. Table 4 provides a concise overview of the institutions that receive the highest number of citations, each having published at least two documents on the subject of utilizing artificial intelligence for fault detection in photovoltaic systems. The Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Photovoltaic Science and Engineering holds the top position in the rankings with 177 publications, as depicted in Table 4. Arizona State University comes in second with 129 publications, followed by the College of Physics and Information Engineering with 89 publications. These three institutions occupy the highest positions on the list. Notably, the same table reveals that both Germany and the United States each have three institutions actively engaged in research on fault detection, showcasing their significant interest in this field of study. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that two branches of Texas A&M University located in Qatar are also included in the table. The examination of these data results in the creation of the following question: \u201cHow can a country enhance its research and development framework to reinforce its competitiveness?\u201d Is it based on a \u2018distributed\u2019 approach with multiple laboratories conducting research in parallel or on a centralized approach with a small number of research centers focusing on numerous specialized studies in the same research topic?\u201d As stated in reference [204], the formulation of such inquiries holds important significance, especially in the area of renewable energy, for shaping future research and development policies. Confronting the formidable challenges within this domain is imperative. Table 5 offers an examination of the quantity of research laboratories in relation to the volume of published papers and their citations. The data reveals a preference for an approach centered on \u201csmall, decentralized research units,\u201d except for three specific institutions. In Table 5, discrimination is performed between institutions based on their citation count, distinguishing those with 0 or more citations from those with 10 or more citations. Interestingly, among the total of 333 institutes, only 102 of them have more than 10 citations. It is important to note that the number of institutions drastically decreases from 333 with one publication to 20 with two publications, and further decreases to 3 with three publications. Only one institution is associated with five publications. This observation can be attributed to the fact that the application of machine learning or artificial intelligence techniques to fault detection in renewable energy is a relatively new field, and thus there is limited experience in this area. The results obtained after applying the filter of 10 citations per institution are also presented. The impact of this filtering supports the hypothesis that there is insufficient time between two recent papers for the formation of a collaboration network, especially when the time span is less than three years. To identify the main interactions between institutions, a bibliographic map was constructed and its result is illustrated in Fig. 9 . This map offers a graphical depiction of the connections between 17 institutions with at least two publications, categorizing them into three separate clusters. As shown in Fig. 9, each node corresponds to an institution from Table 4. However, Fig. 9 indicates that not all institutions are present. Further analysis reveals that this refers to the first three institutions listed in Table 5. The absence of connections with other top-classified institutions may imply their reluctance to collaborate or their citations being considered as self-citations. Regarding the remaining institutions listed in Table 4, 17 of them can be grouped into 3 clusters based on existing collaborative efforts. This analysis confirms the existence of two types of strategy used by academic institutions. The first type involves conducting studies without collaborations, which is likely the case for larger institutions. The second type, commonly seen in most organizations, leans toward cooperative efforts, perhaps due to the wide range of expertise spanning multiple domains required to detect faults in PV systems through artificial intelligence (as indicated by the size of the node) or the need to unify research initiatives. The connections between organizations, as indicated by citation links, reveal the interplay of diverse areas of expertise and interests. For example, in cluster 2, there are notable collaborations between the chemical engineering department and the electrical and computer engineering department, both affiliated with Texas A&M University in Qatar. They also foster partnerships with other institutions like the Signals and Systems Laboratory of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the University M Hamed Bougara of Boumerdes, Algeria, the Department of Electronic and Communications Engineering at the Kuwait College of Science and Technology, and the research laboratory specializing in automation in signal processing and image at the national engineering school of Monastir, Tunisia. It is worth noting that most collaborations involving these institutions occur with institutions from other countries, indicating that the field of fault detection is of international significance. In clusters 1 and 3, there are also robust collaborations between institutions from countries such as Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait. This observation suggests that conducting exploratory bibliometric analyses at the country level could yield interesting insights. Table 6 displays the count of countries determined from published documents. Table 6 illustrates a significant decrease in the quantity of countries with at least one publication, which stands at 67, as well as the respective figures for countries with 2 publications (35) and 3 publications (11). It becomes evident that, when the requirement of a minimum of 10 citations per country is introduced, the number of countries with at least one publication diminishes to just 33, and for three documents, it drops even further to 27. The impact on the remaining countries is relatively minor; for example, the number of countries with five documents reduces from 20 to 19. Concurrently, an analysis is conducted to identify the most influential countries in the field of research. To complement this analysis, Table 7 provides a list of the top 20 countries with the highest research productivity in the domain of fault detection in photovoltaic systems using artificial intelligence, considering countries that have published five or more documents. The data presented in Table 7 reveals that China, India, and the United States are the top three countries contributing the highest volume of research in the specified field, with 40, 40, and 39 publications, respectively. In these countries, during the period covered by this review, there is not only an accelerated technological process that has led them to align their government policies towards increasing the use of renewable energies, such as photovoltaics, but also the rapid development of artificial intelligence, promoted in parallel by other industrial sectors. In Table 7, the first three ranks in citations are held by the United States and China, the latter being the country with the highest photovoltaic solar energy capacity [108]), and France, with 538, 515, and 229 citations, respectively. It can also be observed that despite a high number of documents, India has a lower level of citations. This can be compared to France, which has a relatively high level of citations with a smaller number of publications. France has approximately 6.6 times fewer documents than China or the USA but an excellent ratio of 229/8 = 28.2 citations per document, compared to 515/40 = 12.9 for China and 538/39 = 13.8 for the US. This difference can be attributed to the fact that in France, many scientific studies are carried out through collaborative approaches involving both academia and industry in long-term projects. It is also linked to the publication culture practiced by French researchers, who often choose to publish in international journals with high impact factors. For various reasons, countries such as China, the USA, and France can be considered as target countries for creating collaborative networks in the studied area. To understand the collaboration networks involving the 20 countries listed in Table 7, a bibliometric map by countries was created using VOSviewer, as shown in Fig. 10 . The overall robustness of a country-to-country relationship depends on the quantity of research papers jointly authored by two or more countries [128]. As mentioned before, these bibliometric maps extract valuable information and assist researchers in positioning their own work and identifying potential collaborators [205]. In Fig. 10, the five distinct clusters have been established by analyzing the occurrence frequency of common terms within the documents of each country. These clusters are defined by the frequency at which shared terms appear together in documents from two or more interconnected countries. For example, the strength of the link that signifies collaboration between the United States and Cyprus is 6, and this strength is directly proportional to the thickness of the connecting line. In contrast, the link between the United States and France has a value of only 1, indicating a less robust level of collaboration. Fig. 10 also shows that these interrelationships between countries result in the formation of five clusters, with one country having no collaboration. Cluster 1, highlighted in red, is led by India, which has 40 documents and a total link force of 17 with other countries. This cluster collaborates with countries such as Australia, Denmark, Malaysia, and South Korea. Recent works conducted by these countries involve fault detection using methods such as locally weighted learning, k-nearest neighbor, nearest neighbor, and K-star algorithm applied to images captured by aerial vehicles [206]. These techniques use advanced technology levels and are relatively recent. Furthermore, studies utilizing techniques such as categorical boosting (CatBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting method (LGBM) [207], Isolation Forest, Facebook-Prophet, and AutoEncoder Long Short-Term Memory (AE-LSTM) [208] on electrical signals are also explored. Additionally, works based on neural networks during specific seasons of the year [209], or in combination with fuzzy systems [209,210], are studied. Most of these documents are recent, which may explain their lower citation levels despite their scientific originality and relevance. Cluster 2, visualized in green, is led by China with 40 documents and a total link force of 13. Cluster 2 also includes Algeria, France, and the United Kingdom. These countries are working diligently on the exploration of neural networks as a relevant tool for fault detection. Specifically, they have recently published works that use neural networks with decentralized federated approaches [211], stacked auto-encoder [212], deep learning on luminescence images [213], among others [214]. Cluster 3, represented in blue, is led by the United States with 39 documents and a total link force of 24. This cluster also includes Cyprus, Italy, and Spain. Similar to Cluster 2, these countries are focusing their efforts on exploring neural networks, either in the context of images or in analyzing the characteristic electric curves of photovoltaic systems. Their recent publications include works on these topics [215\u2013218]. Cluster 4, shown in yellow, is led by Germany with 16 documents and a total link force of 19. This cluster also includes Brazil and Iran. These countries are exploring methods such as a Fine Tree Classifier [219] and combinations of artificial neural networks with Sugeno Fuzzy Logic [220]. The fuzzy logic models they use allow for the simultaneous handling of numerical data and linguistic knowledge through a unified mathematics [221]. Additionally, they are working on methods involving weather-corrected indexes, temperature-corrected equations, one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods, kernel techniques, and fault detection in photovoltaic plants [222]. Recent works also integrate fault detection and classification with electrical and environmental condition monitoring systems [223], as well as use a ResNet-34 convolutional neural network in conjunction with a supervised contrastive loss function [224]. Cluster 5, depicted in violet, is led by Saudi Arabia, contributing 14 documents and a cumulative link force of 22. This cluster 5 also covers Qatar and Tunisia. These countries have been actively collaborating on the advancement of diverse fault detection and categorization algorithms in photovoltaic systems. Some of the methods they have explored include an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [225], an interval kernel PCA (IKPCA)-based Ensemble Learning (EL) in micro networks [226], a decision tree-based algorithm [226], probabilistic neural networks in photovoltaic arrays [214], and machine learning techniques centered around kernels, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) [227]. Finally, among the countries mentioned, Taiwan is unique in having a minimum of 5 published documents and 8 citations, yet it lacks collaborative ties with other countries. It is important to note, though, that Taiwan shares a common interest with the other countries in the exploration of diverse neural network algorithms. Some recent studies conducted in Taiwan have focused on comparing the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) when utilizing an enhanced gamma correction function and a threshold function on infrared thermographic images of solar modules [228]. Another interesting paper delves into both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) signals within the photovoltaic system, transforming them into 3D images through the Gramian Angular Field transform (GAF) for signal preprocessing [229]. The results achieved through these methods outperform those of traditional machine learning techniques like k-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, in Taiwan, research has also been conducted on modifications of conventional methods such as Random Forest and the independent component analysis (ICA) method [230]. These modified methods achieved performances of 99.88% and 99.43% in the proposed scenarios. These situations arise from instances involving imbalanced datasets, where one class contains a significantly larger number of observations than the other classes. After analyzing the co-authorship patterns in publications in this field, an analysis of citations based on documents and sources (journals) is carried out. 5.2 Citation analysis Bibliometric analysis has the capability to quantitatively synthesize a research topic and provide information on the main trends in research through the examination of citations [121]. Consequently, a comprehensive citation analysis is conducted to gain a deeper comprehension of the evolution of research in the subject of interest. The mapping of citations via bibliometrics can be performed using various analytical units, such as documents, sources, authors, establishments, or countries. However, this study exclusively concentrates on documents and sources. Regarding the quantity of documents, there are 159 publications that have received at least one citation. Furthermore, 80 publications have obtained five or more citations, 32 publications have acquired 20 or more citations, and finally, only three documents have accumulated 123 citations or more. These statistics are detailed in Table 8 . The associated bibliographic map is created by considering only the publications with 20 or more citations, as indicated in Table 8, resulting in a selection of 32 publications. Among this collection of documents, just 18 of them exhibit interconnections, indicating that they reference at least one of the other publications on the list. The connections between these documents are represented as links between nodes in Fig. 11 . The analysis described and its graphical representation are relevant because they provide insights into the interconnections among the most significant publications, as evaluated by their total number of citations. Fig. 11 illustrates these connections, where a strong linkage between nodes indicates that highly cited documents reference each other. In the VOSviewer-generated citation visualization map, each node is equipped with a hyperlink leading to the corresponding online repository of the article. An examination of the data reveals that the articles with the highest number of citations, in decreasing order, are Zhao (2015) [59] with 186 citations, Chen (2017) [231] with 180 citations, Dhimish (2018) [221] with 127 citations, and Chen (2018) [232] with 110 citations. For a comprehensive list of the top 13 most cited articles derived from the dataset, please consult Table 9 . In a complementary manner, it is also interesting to conduct an analysis based on sources. These sources refer to indexed journals obtained from the corpus of data under study, resulting in a total of 170 different sources. Fig. 12 illustrates the network mapping associated with the 41 sources that share two or more links. However, the largest connected element set represented in the network consists of 21 elements. Like the previous maps, this representation includes information regarding the significance of each node, which represents a scientific journal, along with its corresponding number of publications. The connections between the journals are shown by links. This type of analysis and visual depiction holds significance as it allows to gain insights into the most frequently referenced sources (research papers or journal publications) and the potential interconnections between these sources via citations in papers published in other journals. This result enables the academic community to identify the main sources of publications with significant impacts, leading to potentially more citations. It helps to promote the latest innovative approaches, compare and position research with these references, increase visibility, and improve the possibility of disseminating new results in the research field. This analysis focuses only on sources from documents published in peer-reviewed journals obtained after applying filters. In order to categorize these resources, the commonly acknowledged metric known as the \u201cH-index\u201d can be employed. The \u201cH-index\u201d serves as a measure to assess the scholarly output of an author or journal by considering the quantity and quality of citations their publications receive. This metric takes into account both the volume of publications and the frequency of citations. Essentially, the \u201cH-index\u201d represents the number \u201ch\u201d of documents that have been cited at least \u201ch\u201d times each [233]. However, to provide more relevant information, the H-index can be complemented with other indicators, particularly those dedicated to evaluating the quality of journals in specific fields. For example, it can be supplemented by the well-known \u201cImpact Factor\u201d or a new indicator proposed by Scimago called the \u201cSJR\u201d [234]. The SJR indicator is associated with a quartile (Q) that categorizes journals into four categories. The SJR indicator improves the H-index by incorporating two variables to assess the quality of each journal. The first variable is the number of citations, which is modulated based on the origin of each citation. Citations from journals considered as references in the main field of the source are deemed more pertinent than others. A clustering method known as the \u201cauthority\u201d principle is used to classify documents within each quartile (Q), illustrating the distribution of themes across different categories. If a journal receives major citations from other journals categorized within the same field, its quartile (Q) will be higher. Q1 represents the highest quality level of a journal, while Q4 represents the lowest. It is important to note that some journals can cover different fields. Thus, in the Scimago platform, these scientific sources have different quartiles associated with each thematic area. The values described in this research pertain specifically to the application of artificial intelligence in the identification of faults within photovoltaic systems. In turn, these results are associated with the use and management of renewable energies. Using these indicators, namely the H-index and the SJR provided by Scimago on May 11, 2022, the quantity of documents released within the field of interest totals 170 out of a grand total of 409 documents. Table 10 presents the 20 sources with four or more published documents on the subject of interest. Table 10 summarizes the most important journals on fault detection applied to renewable energy based on the amount of publications in the field, it can be observed that Solar Energy stands out with 41 publications, almost twice as many as Energies (24). Following closely are IEEE Access (21) and Energy Conversion and Management (19). Another viewpoint, based on the H-Index, suggests that Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews is the most noteworthy journal in this field, with the highest value of 337. This can be compared to the high H-Index values of other internationally recognized peer-reviewed journals in the field, such as IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, Applied Energy, Energy, Energy Conversion and Management, and Renewable Energy. Furthermore, considering other indicators, specifically the SJR index associated with the quartiles Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, approximately 65% of the sources mentioned in Table 10 belong to the highest category, Q1. Additionally, these sources possess an SJR value exceeding 1, signifying significant citations from influential sources. Taking all these factors into account, it can be deduced that the most valuable articles or references regarding the application of artificial intelligence in detecting faults in photovoltaic systems are determined not just by the volume of publications but also by their impact factor and the sources from which they are cited. After obtaining a comprehensive understanding through coauthorship and citation analysis, an examination of the existing associations among keywords is carried out using a metric known as cooccurrence. As discussed in the work of Radhakrishnan et al. [235], the goal of analyzing a keyword co-occurrence network is to delve into the components and knowledge framework of a scientific domain by examining the relationships between keywords in prior research. In simpler terms, the cooccurrence metric considers that two or more concepts (keywords) co-occur when they frequently appear together in a set of documents, although it rarely appears independently in other documents. TThis new exploration aims to improve understanding and knowledge of the main research topics pertaining to fault detection in photovoltaic systems and how documents can be categorized into distinct clusters or trends based on their affinities with AI algorithms. 5.3 Co-occurrence In the field of bibliometrics, an examination of co-occurrence was performed by utilizing a matrix of keywords that appear together. The objective of this analysis was to reveal potential relationships between two elements found within bibliographic works that are present in the same work [236]. The methods for carrying out co-occurrence analysis in bibliometrics have matured over the past two decades [237,238]. Consequently, some researchers have introduced strategies aimed at creating novel approaches for analyzing Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms sourced from the PubMed literature database [239]. This approach is commonly referred to as MeSH term co-occurrence analysis. The typical workflow for MeSH term co-occurrence analysis involves: (i) extracting MeSH term data from the PubMed database; (ii) constructing a co-occurrence matrix; and (iii) performing downstream analysis on the matrix [236,240\u2013242]. However, despite the widespread utilization of this method, it possesses a notable limitation related to the selection of a critical threshold for eliminating low-frequency elements or reducing the dimensionality of the co-occurrence matrix. Alternative methods propose: (i) employing the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm for keyword extraction from document abstracts; (ii) constructing a co-occurrence matrix; (iii) calculating the \u201csemantic similarity\u201d between each keyword in matrix form, which is then combined with the co-occurrence matrix of extracted keywords from the document corpus to generate a weighted co-occurrence matrix [243]. The results are then represented graphically through a Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN). Alternatively, other authors suggest keyword extraction and matrix construction through a graph-based ranking algorithm called TextRank [244]. These approaches for keyword extraction and visualization have already been automated and standardized in software tools such as Ucinet, 2 2 UCINET, developed by Steve Borgatti, Martin Everett, and Lin Freeman, is a social network analysis program. The free trial version can be downloaded here. Pajek, 3 3 Pajek is available for noncommercial which can be downloaded here. or VOSviewer. In this study, VOSviewer software was employed because of its extensive adoption for conducting keyword co-occurrence analysis in diverse areas of expertise [245\u2013252]. Co-occurrence analysis was conducted for all keywords using the same tools mentioned earlier (VOSviewer), specifically utilizing a full counting method. Table 11 displays the initial findings of this analysis, highlighting the connection between occurrence count and the number of keywords in photovoltaic systems-related fields. As shown in Table 11, there are a total of 1922 distinct keywords that appear in the comprehensive data corpus consisting of 620 peer-reviewed articles. On average, each document contains approximately 3 keywords (1922/620 = 3.1). These initial findings suggest that only a select few keyword groups exhibit a significant frequency of occurrence. Subsequently, an additional study was conducted to identify the most commonly utilized keywords within the field of photovoltaic research. The aim of this study was to accurately position the research and enhance its visibility and dissemination. Upon analyzing Table 11, it was found that 20 different keywords appeared in at least 50 documents, with only three keywords appearing in 100 corpus publications. Therefore, it was decided to focus additional attention on a detailed analysis highlighting the 11 most commonly used keywords, as shown in Table 12 . Before commencing this analysis, it should be noted that the selected words are combined with their synonyms to ensure that two keywords with high relevance are not treated separately. The main keywords are presented in Table 12 with their corresponding number of occurrences. It was found that some AI techniques are currently being used as scientific approaches with positive results in detecting faults in photovoltaic systems. Among the most frequent keywords we can observe three related to neural networks called \u201cNeural networks\u201d, \u201cConvolutional neural networks\u201d, and \u201cDeep learning\u201d and three related to conventional methods, namely, \u201cSupport Vector Machines\u201d, \u201cDecision Trees\u201d and \u201cRandom Forest\u201d. Two bibliometric maps were created to gain a deeper understanding of key terms, their groupings/associations, and their importance over time. To simplify these maps, only keywords with a minimum occurrence of 5 were included. The first bibliometric map reveals the associations between the keywords. It identifies around 137 keywords linked to six significant keyword clusters with the purpose of determining global associations between the articles. The degree to which keywords appear together (co-occurrence) is influenced by how close they are to each other and how similar they are [253]. To extract the scientific areas involved, each cluster is classified according to the classification proposed in [254]. Fig. 13 depicts a Cluster Visualization Map that showcases the keywords that occur together within six simultaneous keyword groups. The clusters are categorized based on the respective methods they are associated with. Cluster 1, labeled the \u201cSymbolic approach\u201d and represented in green in Fig. 13, consists of 26 keywords. A significant portion of these keywords is related to classification techniques, such as \u201cdecision trees\u201d, \u201crandom forest\u201d, \u201cregression tree\u201d, \u201cC4.5 decision tree\u201d, \u201cgradient boosting\u201d, and \u201cbinary tree bagging\u201d, \u201cAdaboost\u201d, \u201cRotation forest\u201d, \u201cclustering hierarchical\u201d and \u201cfuzzy logic\u201d. This cluster focuses primarily on analyzing the behavior of photovoltaic arrays at various scales with an interest in \u201cfeature extraction\u201d and \u201cfeature selection\u201d. Some works in this cluster also explore hybrid methodologies, utilizing algorithms such as the \u201cextreme learning machine\u201d. In summary, Cluster 1 can be considered a group of interest for photovoltaic fault detection using symbolic methods based on master algorithms. Cluster 2, labeled as the \u201cRegression approach\u201d in blue, also consists of 26 keywords. This cluster seems to concentrate on detecting and classifying faults in different systems, including \u201celectric inverters\u201d, \u201cdistributed power generation systems\u201d, \u201celectric power transmission systems\u201d, \u201cgrid-connected PV systems\u201d and \u201csmart grid\u201d. The detection methods represented in this cluster include terms such as \u201clinear model\u201d, \u201clinear regression\u201d, \u201cLogistic regression\u201d, \u201cprincipal component analysis\u201d, \u201cislanding detection\u201d, and \u201cregression analysis\u201d. The techniques used in this cluster aim to exploit the richness of electrical signals by performing statistical and signal processing analyses, including \u201csignal processing\u201d based on methods such as time-frequency decomposition using \u201cwavelet transforms\u201d (with 19 occurrences). This cluster can be regarded as photovoltaic fault detection using a regression approach. Cluster 3, labeled as the \u201cBayesian approach\u201d in yellow, comprises 25 keywords. Some of the terms found in this cluster include \u201cGaussian process\u201d, \u201cgraph-based semi-supervised learning\u201d, \u201cna\u00efve Bayes classification\u201d, and \u201cBayesian belief network\u201d. Certain hybrid algorithms identified in this cluster also overlap with those found in Cluster 1, and they are linked to keywords such as \u201cfuzzy inference\u201d, \u201cfuzzy logic\u201d, and \u201cfuzzy neural networks\u201d. Many works in this cluster are applied to improve reliability in microgrids. Hence, this cluster can be considered as a group focused on photovoltaic fault detection using a Bayesian approach. Cluster 4, labeled \u201cAnalogy-based approach\u201d in purple, consists of 25 keywords. The documents associated with this cluster place considerable emphasis on the quality and handling of the data. Terms such as \u201cdata acquisition\u201d, \u201cdata handling\u201d, and \u201cdigital storage\u201d are highlighted in this context. The descriptions for implementing these treatments in physical systems are associated with terms such as \u201ccyber-physical system\u201d, \u201cembedded systems\u201d, and \u201cinternet of things\u201d. In terms of algorithms used, the works explore approaches such as \u201csupport vector machine\u201d, \u201clocal outlier factor\u201d, \u201cpolynomial SVM\u201d, \u201clinear SVM\u201d, \u201csupport vector regression\u201d, \u201cradial basis function\u201d, \u201ck-nearest neighbor\u201d, and \u201ck-means\u201d. Some documents in this cluster combine these algorithms with methods such as \u201cneural networks\u201d or use ensemble learning. The works in this cluster are oriented toward \u201ccost-effectiveness\u201d, \u201cmonitoring\u201d, and \u201coperation and maintenance\u201d. The cluster covers a wide range of photovoltaic system scales, including terms such as \u201cphotovoltaic panels\u201d, \u201cphotovoltaic power stations\u201d, and \u201csolar cell arrays\u201d. Thus, this cluster can be categorized as photovoltaic fault detection using an analogy-based approach. Cluster 5, labeled as the \u201cConnectionist approach\u201d in red, consists of 28 keywords. Terms such as \u201cdeep learning\u201d, \u201cconvolutional neural network\u201d, \u201cbackpropagation neural networks\u201d, \u201cartificial neural network\u201d, \u201cextreme learning machine\u201d, \u201clong short-term memory networks\u201d, \u201cextension\u201d, \u201crecurrent\u201d, \u201cbagging\u201d, \u201cbootstrap-based\u201d, \u201cdynamic recurrent\u201d, \u201cdeep belief network\u201d, \u201cMultilayer neural networks\u201d, \u201cMultilayer perceptron\u201d, \u201cprobabilistic neural networks\u201d, \u201cautoencoder\u201d, \u201centropy\u201d, and \u201cOnline Sequential\u201d are found. Additionally, new approaches linked to terms such as \u201ctransfer learning\u201d are discovered, where models are built based on pre-trained models, reducing development time by making a few modifications. These approaches are highly efficient in terms of computational time. Most of the works are related to image analysis, which is why terms such as \u201cimage classification\u201d, \u201cimage processing\u201d, \u201cinfrared imaging\u201d, and \u201cthermography\u201d are found at different scales. This is due to the presence of keywords such as \u201cphotovoltaic modules\u201d, \u201cphotovoltaic plant\u201d, and \u201csolar cells\u201d. This cluster can be referred to as photovoltaic fault detection using the Connectionist approach. Lastly, Cluster 6, labeled as the \u201cEvolutionary approach\u201d in light blue, consists of only 7 keywords. In this cluster, keywords related to algorithms such as \u201cAnt colony optimization\u201d, \u201cGenetic Algorithm\u201d, and \u201cParticle Swarm Optimization\u201d are found. It can be observed that this cluster shows an interest in analyzing the \u201caccuracy evaluation\u201d of the algorithm in different elements or, more generally, in a \u201cphotovoltaic system\u201d. This cluster can be referred to as photovoltaic fault detection using the Evolutionary approach. As expected, the findings from the analysis of keyword co-occurrence indicate that studies focused on fault detection in photovoltaic systems using artificial intelligence primarily concentrate on analyzing fault detection. It can be inferred that the authors address various scales and technologies of photovoltaic systems and use multiple methods covering both signal processing and artificial intelligence techniques. Six distinct scientific approaches have been identified. However, in order to fully comprehend the recent new objective of research, the insights obtained from the initial co-occurrence analysis can be supplemented by a second analysis conducted using a new bibliometric map, which covers only the last five years. This second analysis is shown in Fig. 14 . By incorporating this additional analysis, the visualization network depicting the overlapping the co-occurrence of keywords can be highlighted in Fig. 14. In addition, Fig. 14 illustrates the evolution of research topics with respect to concurrent keywords during the past five years (2018 - 2022). Several documents indicate that this new analysis emphasizes research into fault detection using artificial intelligence and its recent rapid evolution. This point can be compared to the previous period when many papers focused on fuzzy systems and signal processing until 2018. A transition period (2018 - 2020) can be observed, during which research was supported by issues of signature extraction, monitoring, and some traditional machine learning techniques like random forests, neural networks or decision trees. More recently, since 2020, the authors have primarily focused their efforts on research oriented towards the utilization of neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks and deep learning. It is worth mentioning that in-depth studies of specific time periods reveal a notable rise in publications focused on identifying anomalies. This is likely due to the trend toward the high complexity of training systems designed for fault classification in photovoltaic systems. Such systems require previous work to build a robust database and subsequently train artificial intelligence systems under optimal conditions. The effectiveness of the outcomes and their capacity to detect every potential fault in a photovoltaic system is greatly influenced by the quality and amount of accessible data. For these reasons, the main objectives of the authors are aimed at improving the capacity to evaluate the healthy behavior of the photovoltaic power plant and determining when the behavior deviates from the healthy baseline, which is referred to as abnormal or anomaly behavior. Additionally, an important trend has emerged recently, with a shift in research interest from fault detection based only on electrical signals to hybrid detection methods that incorporate image analysis (thermal, infrared, etc.), thereby significantly expanding the spectrum of fault detection and its complexity. In summary, this approach using keywords and their occurrences can be considered a valuable tool to aid in understanding different trends and why certain machine learning algorithms are more appropriate than others for detection of faults in photovoltaic power plants. However, a more detailed analysis of the content of the documents within each cluster was performed using an expert qualitative content analysis. 6 Expert qualitative content analysis To complete the construction of the state of the art, this section exposes a content analysis of each cluster obtained in Section 5.3. In order to streamline this analysis, only the three most relevant articles are considered, with preference given to those that are highly cited, assuming that they best explain and exemplify the purpose of each cluster. The algorithms presented in each article were thoroughly analyzed to ensure that they truly belong to the identified cluster and represent its general trends. Initially, this analysis revealed that all the identified clusters align with the classification presented by Rodrigues et al. [255]. This classification is further supported by the main contributions of the algorithms found within each group, which were extracted using the \u201cmaster algorithm\u201d tool. The notion of the \u201cmaster algorithm\u201d was first presented by Domingos [254] in his book entitled \u201cThe Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World\u201d. The author regards the \u201cmaster algorithm\u201d as a unifying factor in machine learning, postulating that it is a hypothetical algorithm capable of comprehending the behavior of any system perfectly. Considering the perspectives of these two authors, the clusters are assigned the following names: \u201cSymbolic approach\u201d, \u201cRegression approach\u201d, \u201cBayesian approach\u201d, \u201cAnalogy-based approach\u201d, \u201cConnectionist approach\u201d, and \u201cEvolutionary approach\u201d, respectively. This study affirms that each cluster has its own master algorithm with its unique properties and limitations. 6.1 Cluster 1 - symbolic approach This cluster groups algorithms whose master algorithm is identified as inverse deduction, also known as induction. The approaches in this cluster aim to reach specific conclusions based on preexisting knowledge that has been previously learned [254]. Due to the computational expense of inverse deduction, the application of these algorithms on massive datasets has been challenging to generalize. Some well-known algorithms in this cluster include Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Fuzzy Logic [256]. Several works propose the use of these algorithms, also referred to as symbolist algorithms, for fault detection in photovoltaic systems. The most cited article by Chen et al. (2018) [232], with 110 citations, addresses the issues of overfitting and limited performance in supervised fault classification algorithms trained on fault data samples. The authors focus is on identifying and diagnosing faults within photovoltaic panels, such as line-to-line faults, degradation, open circuits, and partial shading. They accomplish this by monitoring the real-time operating voltage and string currents of a laboratory photovoltaic system, and then comparing these values with data from a simulated photovoltaic system in Simulink. In their work, Chen et al. (2018) [232] introduce a classifier known as the Random Forest (RF) ensemble learning algorithm. They employ a grid search method to fine-tune the parameters of the RF model, with the goal of minimizing out-of-bag error estimation. This approach offers several advantages, including enhanced classifier performance and seamless integration with real-time monitoring systems. The method proposed in this study achieves a remarkable level of performance, with a 99.240% accuracy rate for fault detection and a 99.135% accuracy rate for fault classification. In a study conducted by Dhibi et al. (2020) [257], which has been cited 39 times, two enhanced Random Forest (RF) classifiers were introduced. These classifiers were designed to tackle issues like the lack of correlation between variables in RF. They are known as the Reduced Kernel RF based on Euclidean distance ( R K \u2212 R F E D ) and the Reduced Kernel RF based on K-means clustering ( R K \u2212 R F K m e a n s ). Both of these classifiers utilize real-system data, specifically static information from the process data. These methods follow a two-stage process: first, feature extraction and selection, followed by fault classification. R K \u2212 R F E D uses the Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity metric for feature extraction and selection, employing principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selection. This algorithm achieved a 100% precision rate in both the training and testing phases. On the other hand, R K \u2212 R F K m e a n s reduces the training data volume by applying K-means clustering and PCA. This method also demonstrated a precision rate of 100% in both training and testing phases. The primary focus of these approaches is to reduce the dimensionality of databases while preserving relevant information. These classifiers were assessed using data from an emulated grid-connected photovoltaic system, with the results showcasing high classification accuracy and efficient computation. Finally, a study by Madani et al. (2012) [258], cited 19 times, introduces an intelligent-based islanding detection algorithm for photovoltaic and Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) units. Initially, the Decision Tree algorithm is employed for islanding detection, thanks to its low computational cost and interpretability. The authors then introduce a boosting technique known as AdaBoost to enhance the performance of the Decision Tree classifier. AdaBoost iteratively trains weak or base classifiers, giving more importance to previously misclassified data to create a more robust classifier. This method was tested on a distribution system that includes photovoltaic, DFIG, and synchronous generators. For islanding detection features, a set of 16 first- and second-order derivatives of current and voltage signals is used. The results show a precision rate of 100% for AdaBoost and 92.5% for the Decision Tree algorithms. In Fig. 15 , the algorithms detected within this cluster 1 are displayed along with their respective occurrence counts. As depicted in Fig. 15, the Cluster 1 primarily employs decision tree and random forest algorithms, which are the most commonly utilized methods in this context. However, it is evident that due to the complexity of acquiring reliable fault labels, the usage of unsupervised algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering, is on the rise. 6.2 Cluster 2 - regression approach This paragraph discusses a cluster of algorithms that are categorized according to their data characteristics. These algorithms are not learning algorithms; instead, they are regressive algorithms that depend on past data [254]. Some well-known algorithms in this cluster include ARIMA, Linear Regression models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and statistical machine learning approaches [256]. Several studies suggest utilizing regression techniques for fault detection in photovoltaic systems within this particular group. The most cited article [259] in this context, with 33 references, combines machine learning with statistical hypothesis testing to enhance the detection of faults in photovoltaic systems. They employ Gaussian process regression (GPR) in conjunction with a generalized likelihood ratio test diagram. The study assesses the proposed method using both actual and simulated photovoltaic systems, taking into account parameters such as current, voltage, and power. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through an analysis of computation time, Missed Detection Rate (MDR = 7.14%), and False Alarm Rate (FAR = 6.83%) [259]. The second article, authored by Haiji et al. in 2021 [260], with 21 references, introduces a two-stage fault detection process that begins with feature extraction and selection as the initial step. They employ the PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and then input the resulting PCA data into six supervised machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree, Discriminant Analysis (DA), K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Random Forest (RF). The proposed method is assessed using data from a real grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV) system [260]. The author provides precision ranges for three algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with a range of 98.21% to 99.97%, Random Forest (RF) with a range of 99.61% to 100%, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a range of 97.73% to 99.97%. Finally, Hopwood et al. (2020) [261] also propose an article with 3 citations. This article proposes the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the size of the initial data set and generate uncorrelated variables, thus improving the interpretability. The study focuses on static current-voltage characteristics (IV) and uses a random forest classifier on the reduced data. The authors demonstrate that in the worst case presented, the use of PCA improves classification accuracy up to 99% compared to 98% without PCA. Additionally, the team explores different approaches to extract information from the IV curve, which aids in fault classification, especially for faults with subtle changes in the IV curves [261]. In general, these articles highlight the application of regression approaches, such as ARIMA, Linear Regression, PCA, and statistical machine learning, in fault detection for photovoltaic systems. They demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through various evaluation metrics and real-world data. In Fig. 16 , the algorithms detected within this cluster are shown along with their respective occurrence counts. As seen in Fig. 16, the algorithms found within this cluster can be grouped into two main categories without loss of generality: Dimensionality reducers and regressions. 6.3 Cluster 3 - Bayesian approach This cluster groups algorithms identified by the master algorithm tool as probabilistic inference algorithms. These algorithms share the common property of reducing uncertainty in new knowledge by utilizing the probabilistic event inference algorithm [255]. They are designed to recognize the inherent uncertainty and incompleteness present in all types of knowledge. In these algorithms, a probability is assigned to each known event. If the data supports a hypothesis, the hypothesis gains more weight. On the contrary, if the data contradict the hypothesis, less weight is assigned to it [254]. Some well-known methods used in this cluster include Na\u00efve Bayes and Monte Carlo [256]. Multiple works in this cluster propose the detection of faults in photovoltaic systems through the utilization of a Bayesian approach. One of the most frequently referenced articles in this field, authored by Zhao et al. in 2015 [59], and cited 186 times, offers an alternative solution to conventional fault detection methods that typically rely on supervised learning models trained with a substantial amount of labeled data representing various fault types. This study underscores three primary limitations of supervised fault detection techniques: i) obtaining labeled photovoltaic data is challenging and costly, especially for high-power photovoltaic installations, ii) the trained model is not easily updatable, and iii) the model is intricate to visualize and interpret. To tackle these challenges, Zhao et al. [59] puts forth a graph-based semi-supervised learning model that necessitates only a limited number of labeled training data. These training data are normalized beforehand to enhance visualization. This article marks an initial stride toward effective fault identification without the need for extensive data. Notably, the model proposed by Zhao et al. [59] possesses the capability to autonomously learn about photovoltaic systems over time, even under varying weather conditions. The author attests to a 100% accuracy for both line-to-line fault and open-circuit fault. The second article, presented by Momeni et al. in 2020 [262], with 23 citations, introduces a comprehensive approach to fault identification, classification, localization, and correction employing a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm and a substantial number of class labels. The system initially identifies the fault type and location, subsequently isolating it temporarily to ensure uninterrupted system operation until the fault is entirely corrected. Momeni et al. [262] proposes several normalization methods to enhance the differentiation between healthy and impacted panels. The results presented are exceptionally promising and arouse interest in the research community, as the methodology can be applied to photovoltaic systems of varying sizes due to a series of data normalization equations. The author demonstrates a 100% accuracy for both line-to-line fault and open circuit fault. Lastly, the third article, proposed by Niazi et al. in 2019 [263], with 4 citations, recommends a distributed fault diagnosis approach for photovoltaic arrays that revolves around fine-tuning the Naive Bayes (FTNB) model. This approach addresses faults such as open-circuit, short-circuit, shading, abnormal degradation, and abnormal bypass diode. The Naive Bayes classifier, grounded in Bayesian principles [264], is utilized to compute the probability that each sample belongs to each category based on the attribute value of the sample. The results obtained facilitate the identification of the category with the highest probability as the predicted category for the new sample. After the model is calibrated, a set of fault data is employed to train the system, and fault signatures are then extracted from the maximum power point signals of photovoltaic inverters and meteorological data. However, the results are solely validated using simulated data. The author attests to a 99.2% accuracy for Hotspot fault. In Fig. 17 , the algorithms detected within this cluster are displayed along with their respective occurrence counts. In Fig. 17, it is evident that there are more articles employing graph-based algorithms. This is because graph-based algorithms enable addressing semi-supervised problems, meaning they partially solve the issue of fault labeling in photovoltaic systems. 6.4 Cluster 4 - analogy-based approach This cluster comprises algorithms known as kernel machines, which are called by a master algorithm. These algorithms assess resemblances between previous and new data by employing nearest-neighbor kernel machine algorithms to scrutinize their surroundings and create generalizations founded on similarity. This group of algorithms produces results like neural networks [254]. However, a major drawback of these algorithms is their high dependence on the size of the dataset, calculation time, and the complexity of programming, which can quickly become significant. Among the most popular algorithms in this group are K-Nearest Neighbor and support vector machines algorithms [256]. Several studies in this category suggest utilizing analytical-based strategies for detecting faults in photovoltaic systems. The most referenced article in this regard, authored by Baghae et al. in 2020 [265] (with 46 citations), addresses the problem of islanding detection. The proposed technique involves the application of support vector machines (SVM) and acquires input data through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. These simulations are based on an electrical analogy model of the system, calibrated using experimentally measured parameters from a photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach assesses nondetection zones (NDZ) and detection time (DT) along two dimensions: the active power generated by the PV plant (ranging from 0% to 110% of the installed power capacity, P i n s t a l l e d ), and the voltage levels of the distribution network (\u00b110% of Nominal distribution network voltage U n ). The author demonstrates a 100% accuracy in detecting islanding and grid fault events. In another article presented by Harrou et al. in 2019 [266] (with 42 citations), a distinct fault classification approach is introduced, with a focus on anomaly detection. The authors propose a model-based anomaly detection method for monitoring the direct current (DC) side of photovoltaic systems. This method combines the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) technique with univariate monitoring methods. The study introduces kNN-based and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) Shewhart schemes with both parametric and nonparametric thresholds to effectively identify faults in photovoltaic systems. The kNN method is particularly highlighted for its strong performance in handling non-linear datasets, such as those found in photovoltaic systems. The EWMA approach is employed due to its sensitivity in detecting minor changes. The kNN model utilizes residuals between actual and simulated signals as input, and parametric thresholds are suggested for fault identification. The final model is validated using a real 9.54 kWp grid-connected photovoltaic plant in Algeria. The author reports precision ranges of 75.6% to 99.1% for detecting open circuits, shading faults and short circuits. Finally, a third article proposed by Ali et al. in 2020 [267] (with 28 citations) suggested a hybrid feature-based support vector machine (SVM) model that employs infrared thermography for the detection of hot spots in photovoltaic (PV) panels. This method introduces a novel hybrid feature vector that combines RGB, texture, the oriented gradient histogram (HOG), and the local binary pattern (LBP). The suggested approach categorizes panels into three groups: healthy, non-faulty hotspots, and faulty. The authors attain a training accuracy of 96.8% and a test accuracy of 92% using this approach. Moreover, this method exhibits lower computational complexity compared to other machine learning algorithms [267]. Lastly, a third article proposed by Ali et al. in 2020 [267] (28 citations) suggests a hybrid feature-based support vector machine (SVM) model that uses the infrared thermography technique for detecting hot spots in photovoltaic (PV) panels. This method introduces a novel hybrid feature vector that combines RGB, texture, the oriented gradient histogram (HOG), and the local binary pattern (LBP). The proposed approach classifies panels into three types: healthy, non-faulty hotspots, and faulty. The authors achieve a training accuracy of 96.8% and a test accuracy of 92% using this method. Additionally, this approach demonstrates lower computational complexity compared to other artificial intelligence algorithms [267]. In Fig. 18 , the algorithms detected within this cluster are shown along with their respective occurrence counts. As observed in Fig. 18, most of the documents within this cluster use classical support vector machines or their variants, together with K nearest neighbor algorithms. However, it is noteworthy that articles utilizing ensemble learning can also be found. In these cases, the authors connect multiple algorithms sequentially or in parallel to improve diagnostic fault efficiency. Equally interesting is the use of the local outlier factor, focusing primarily on anomaly detection and clustering algorithms (k-means [268]). The hypothesis of this study is that the growing adoption of these types of algorithms is once again linked to the complexity of accurately labeling faults for subsequent use in supervised algorithms. 6.5 Cluster 5 - connectionist approach This cluster covers algorithms with backpropagation as the master algorithm. These algorithms simulate brain functions by creating artificial neurons and connecting them in a neural network with input, hidden, and output layers. The input neurons transmit information to hidden neurons, which produce output that is readable by other neurons with the same function [254]. The most prominent algorithms in this category include extreme learning machines and artificial neural networks [256]. In this cluster, various studies focus on fault detection in photovoltaic systems using a connectionist approach. The most cited article, authored by Chen et al. in 2017 [231], addresses situations where fault diagnosis is severely limited by limited monitored information, hindering effective model training and updates. To address this, Chen et al. [231] propose extracting seven characteristics from monitored I-V characteristic curves under different environmental conditions. They use the kernel-based emerging extreme learning machine (KELM) for diagnosis due to its rapid learning and strong generalization. The Nelder-Mead Simplex (NMS) optimization method fine-tunes KELM parameters, improving the classification performance. Testing on a comprehensive data set from a photovoltaic modeling approach in Simulink and real data from a photovoltaic plant confirms the success of the optimized KELM-based fault diagnosis model, achieving high accuracy, reliability, and generalization for both real and simulated data, with precision ranging from 97.9% to 100% for short-circuit, temporary shading faults, and open-circuit. A second article, presented by Garoudja et al. in 2017 [269], with 78 citations, introduces a method to detect and diagnose faults on the direct current (DC) side using the probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier. This approach involves four stages: (i) parameter extraction of the photovoltaic module, (ii) simulation and experimental validation of the assembly, (iii) creation of a database of healthy and defective operations, and (iv) network construction, training, and testing. The unknown electrical parameters of the one-diode model (ODM) are precisely identified in the first stage using the best-so-far ABC algorithm based on the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. These parameters facilitate system simulation using PSIM/Matlab. The detection and diagnosis of faults are then carried out using the PNN network. Testing in a 9.54 kWp grid-connected photovoltaic system includes scenarios of a healthy system, three modules short-circuited in one string, ten modules short-circuited in one string, and a string disconnected from the array. Garoudja et al. [269] demonstrate improved accuracy of the PNN method compared to feedforward backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers, achieving 100% accuracy in detecting string disconnection and short-circuit faults. Lastly, the third article by Chen et al. in 2019 [270], with 75 citations, explores an alternative approach to fault diagnosis that eliminates the need for manual feature extraction or expert knowledge. This is a significant challenge in artificial intelligence-based fault diagnosis, as it can lead to inefficient or incomplete diagnosis models. The authors propose an intelligent fault detection and diagnosis method for photovoltaic arrays based on a deep residual network model trained with the adaptive moment estimation deep learning algorithm. This approach automatically extracts features from raw current-voltage curves, ambient irradiance, and temperature, enhancing performance with a deeper network. Results are validated with real and simulated data, demonstrating superiority over conventional neural network approaches in terms of accuracy, generalizability, reliability, and training efficiency, with precision ranging from 91.84% to 100% for short circuit, shading, open circuit, and degradation faults. In Fig. 19 , the algorithms detected within this cluster are shown along with their respective occurrence counts. As seen in Fig. 19, the current computational advancements have led to the testing of multiple neural network-based algorithms. It is noteworthy that deep learning is rapidly gaining ground. Additionally, the utilization of transfer learning, which involves using pre-trained models to decrease the training time for neural network-based algorithms, has started to gain traction. This development is of great significance, as one of the primary drawbacks of neural network-based algorithms used to be their training time; however, transfer learning has significantly mitigated this issue. 6.6 Cluster 6 - evolutionary approach These algorithms operate by simulating the evolutionary process observed in real genomes and DNA, adhering to Darwinian principles. In this methodology, performance is assessed through the measurement of offspring fitness [255]. These algorithms comprise a group of individuals that compete, undergo recombination and mutation, with only the most fit individuals retained, similar to natural selection in biology [254]. Genetic algorithms and genetic programming are two of the most popular methods falling within this category [256]. Numerous studies suggest applying these evolutionary approaches for detecting faults in photovoltaic systems. An influential work by Mohamed et al. in 2015 [271], with 19 citations, proposes utilizing a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize artificial neural network (ANN) topology for online diagnosis and repair of photovoltaic energy systems. Comparisons with traditional neural networks and fuzzy-based diagnosis methods reveal substantial enhancements in fault detection. The author reports precision ranging from 97.6% to 98.9% in identifying open circuits, degradation, short circuits, and shading faults. In another article by Lin et al. in 2015 [272], with 10 citations, a monitoring system is introduced for measuring parameters like output current, voltage, irradiation, ambient temperature, and irradiation per photovoltaic module. The use of a genetic algorithm as an optimizer for fault detection, coupled with a back-propagation neural network (BP) fault diagnosis model, yields improved diagnostic accuracy. The author reports precision levels between 78.69% and 100% for identifying short circuits, shadows, and aging faults. Lastly, Rodrigues et al. presented a comprehensive approach in 2020 [273], with 3 citations. This approach combines a fuzzy system with five distinct machine learning models: artificial neural networks, multigene genetic programming, regression tree, support vector machines for regression and Gaussian process. The goal was to evaluate at least one algorithm from each machine learning category proposed in [254]. Results indicate that the GA delivered the most favorable outcomes on 5 of the 16 days tested, underscoring its effectiveness in fault detection. The author reports precision levels ranging from 97.5% to 98.7% for string faults within these 5 combinations. In Fig. 20 , the algorithms detected within this cluster are shown along with their respective occurrence counts. As shown in Fig. 20, the utilization of genetic algorithms to attain optimal hyperparameters for fault detection algorithms in photovoltaic systems was extensively studied. However, due to advancements in computational capabilities of contemporary systems and the proliferation of hyperparameters within machine learning algorithms, the exploration of these optimization algorithms and others will constitute a pivotal aspect in the field of photovoltaics and beyond. The technical details of the machine learning approaches presented in the Clusters (1-6) are compared in Table 13 . As evident from Table 13, each cluster (1\u20136) has been explored for diagnosing faults in photovoltaic systems. However, not only the most cited articles set current trends, but it is also important to examine in detail the last few years of publications in the area. Therefore, as a complementary section, this study highlights recent research in this area over the past three years. 6.7 The most recent and significant articles The articles were chosen based on their popularity, level of innovation, and the number of views and downloads. In [274], a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is suggested for training with historical data, using variables like current, voltage, temperature, and irradiance across five categories. The study reports that the CNN model achieved 97.64% training accuracy and 95.20% testing accuracy. Likewise, in [275], authors propose a deep learning approach using a CNN for photovoltaic systems. This method automates feature extraction, reducing computational load while improving classification. They achieved an accuracy of 98.65% in classifying various issues under different atmospheric conditions using current, voltage, and power as input indicators. In [276], a CNN and a fine-tuned VGG-16 model are used to diagnose faults with infrared thermographic images of photovoltaic modules. They achieved a fault detection accuracy of 99.91% and a fault diagnosis accuracy of 99.80% using the VGG-16 model. The faults identified in that study are bypass diode malfunction, partially covered photovoltaic module, shading effect, short circuit, and dust deposition on the photovoltaic panel. In [277], a hybrid model combining CNN and machine learning is presented for various photovoltaic module issues. The hybrid model, implemented on a Raspberry Pi 4, achieved an accuracy level of 94% using a database collected from three different climatic regions. This study focuses on various photovoltaic module faults, including accumulated sand faults in photovoltaic modules, covered photovoltaic modules, cracked photovoltaic modules, degradation, dirty photovoltaic modules, short-circuited photovoltaic modules, and overheated bypass diodes. In [278], authors introduce a deep learning approach for identifying cracks in photovoltaic cells. They evaluate four deep learning models and apply an ensemble learning technique to achieve a precision of 97.93%. Their methodology involves training, evaluation, and comparison of four deep learning models: U-net, LinkNet, FPN, and attention U-net. Model performance is measured using different metrics, including Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1-Score. In [279], machine learning and deep learning techniques are assessed for detecting and diagnosing faults in photovoltaic modules. Deep learning-based methods exhibited a precision of 98.71% for both binary and multiclass detection and classification tasks. The authors compiled a dataset of infrared thermography images from normal and faulty photovoltaic modules such as bypass diode fault, shading effects, photovoltaic module short-circuiting, and accumulated dirt on the photovoltaic module. In [280], a hotspot detection system is proposed using thermographic images and a CNN. The conventional neural network achieved an accuracy of 95.05%, outperforming a short-term memory-based method. In [281], authors introduce a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with a 100% accuracy rate for analyzing historical datasets related to normal and faulty states of photovoltaic systems during the winter season. In [282], weightless neural networks (WNN) are used for detecting visual faults in photovoltaic modules. WNN uses random access memory (RAM) devices to simulate neuronal functionality. This approach achieved a 100% classification accuracy within 1.44 seconds of testing. This approach uses a pre-trained deep learning network (DenseNet-201) and to select the most significant features for classification, the authors used a decision tree algorithm (J48). In [283], Mellit et al. employ machine learning algorithms, decision tree, and random forest to identify and categorize faults based on voltage and current measurement data, achieving 98% accuracy for fault detection and 96% for classification. The faults studied were accumulation of dust, shading, module disconnection, and short-circuited bypass diode using voltage and current measurement data (I-V curves). In [284], an algorithm using logistic regression with cross-validation for fault detection on the DC side of photovoltaic systems shows an accuracy of 97.11%. This approach was applied to scenarios involving short-circuit, open-circuit, and mismatch faults. Lastly, in [78], an innovative cascading classifier method is proposed for predicting the health status of photovoltaic systems. The approach accurately predicts health states and quantifies panel degradation, demonstrating cost-effectiveness. This approach initially identifies severely affected photovoltaic panels by only analyzing the series-collected current data sampled at 1-minute intervals. This is one of the few studies that focused on the analysis of the fault called snail trails. A comprehensive review of these articles reveals the diverse research landscape in photovoltaic system fault detection using artificial intelligence. This comparison offers insights into the objectives pursued by different research teams. 7 Promising research topics This section provides a summary of the key areas of promising research. Firstly, it has been noted in various parts of the articles, particularly those outlined in Section 6, that utilizing hybrid machine learning methods is increasingly vital to enhance the accuracy of fault detection in photovoltaic systems. The authors suggest the fusion of two or more algorithms from different clusters to achieve synergistic advantages, resulting in improved precision in diagnostic and prognostic systems [78,256]. One highly cited article employing hybrid techniques is [221] with 131 citations, which introduces a novel fault detection algorithm for photovoltaic (PV) systems by combining the ANN radial basis function (RBF) network, Mamdani, and Sugeno fuzzy logic systems through a new interface. Another notable article with 42 citations is [285], focusing on DC arc fault detection, proposing a domain adaptation combined with deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DA-DCGAN) methodology implemented in an embedded system and validated with a real 1.5 kW rooftop photovoltaic grid-connected system following the UL-1699B standard. In summary, these hybrid techniques significantly enhance the precision and resilience of fault detection algorithms. As a result, researchers are encouraged to continue developing novel hybrid techniques that combine strengths to produce superior detection and classification outcomes. This is especially relevant given the recent advancements in software and hardware technologies, which expand the capabilities of systems for sampled measurements and real-world execution conditions. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to study hardware approaches for collecting high-quality data specifically designed for fault detection [286]. Upon analyzing the algorithms in Subsection 6.1, it is evident that random forest and decision tree algorithms are the most commonly used. The Symbolic approach generally produces good results. However, there are only a few experiments that use other algorithms less explored from the same cluster. Therefore, it is recommended to increase research on other algorithms such as the C.45 Decision Tree or the binary Tree Bagging. In Subsection 6.2, the main focus of the work focuses on using the PCA algorithm as a dimensionality reducer, followed by the treatment of the data with a classifier. However, there are other options, such as signal processing using ARIMA, SARIMA and SARIMAX models, that enable fault detection based on prediction. Prediction-based fault detection involves comparing predicted values to actual values and ascertaining fault presence by evaluating predefined limit parameters, which may include system damage levels or fault types. In Subsection 6.3, the results obtained from these algorithms, particularly the methods based on semi-supervised learning based on graphs, are very interesting. Researchers are encouraged to further research and apply these algorithms in combination with the data normalizations proposed in the referenced articles. Data normalization can expand the size of databases and contribute to the generalization of fault detection models applied to photovoltaic systems. Analyzing the results of Subsection 6.4, it can be concluded that both kNN and SVM are effectively applied. It is recommended to continue working with these algorithms due to their favorable results. Additionally, exploring other methods within this cluster, such as the local outlier factor or other clustering algorithms that allow anomaly detection such as Dyclee [287] and thus reduce the dependency of fault detection on having fault labels or some kernel modifications for SVM, is also advised. Subsection 6.5 records the most publications, aligning with the observations presented in Fig. 14, demonstrating the growth of research in neural networks. In general, these algorithms require substantial amounts of data, necessitating high computational power. However, with the rapid technological advancements, this limitation is no longer a concern. We strongly encourage the authors to further research these algorithms and explore alternatives such as the \u201cExtreme Learning Machine\u201d, which has shown promising and accurate results. Additionally, they should consider utilizing methods based on pre-trained neural networks to reduce training time such as transfer learning. Furthermore, we strongly encourage researchers to explore various algorithm configurations and methods of connection (such as Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Cascading) within the domain of ensemble learning algorithms. In Subsection 6.6, it becomes evident that only a limited number of articles use evolutionary algorithms. We encourage the authors to explore metaheuristic algorithms more broadly as they allow parameter estimation and model adjustment in fault detection systems. While genetic algorithms are commonly used in fault detection for photovoltaic systems, there are multiple algorithms that offer more accurate results with reduced computation time for the same purposes [288]. We encourage the exploration of alternative algorithms, such as those mentioned in [289]. Moreover, the precision of error detection algorithms correlates directly with the quality of the training data. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to pay more attention to the processes of signature extraction and selection, as discussed in the articles [78,257]. The current challenge goes beyond proposing new algorithms or modifying/combining existing ones to improve precision results. It involves extracting specific patterns (signatures) that accurately identify faults. Thus, this study strongly advocates the exploration of signal processing techniques such as signal filtering and time/frequency signal decomposition. The ability to extract relevant patterns not only facilitates corrective fault detection but also significantly improves preventive fault detection. Moreover, given the vast amounts of data that modern monitoring systems can accumulate, it is necessary to advance the development of novel algorithms for automated signature selection. These dimensionality reduction algorithms will significantly optimize the execution times of machine learning algorithms, as well as diminish the requirements for data storage, transmission, and processing, which is critical to ensure accurate fault detection. These factors become pivotal in scenarios where fault detection systems are embedded and therefore constrained by limited hardware resources. Given the complexity of generating labels to train systems for all types of faults, it is worth noting that an interesting approach is to focus on detecting anomalies where fault labels are unnecessary. This method, commonly referred to as outlier detection or novelty detection, focuses on recognizing uncommon items, events, or observations that greatly differ from the majority or seem inconsistent with the standard or baseline data. Several significant and well-cited works on anomaly detection in photovoltaic systems already exist [290\u2013294]. The primary role of outlier detection is to rapidly and unsupervised identify samples that begin to exhibit a significant performance loss. Outlier detection algorithms typically boast shorter computation times. Furthermore, the identification of atypical samples can significantly impact the accuracy of supervised machine learning models. Failing to appropriately detect and manage outlier values can lead to overfitting, inadequate, or biased results. Some well-known methods include Z-Score, Interquartile Range (IQR), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Therefore, we strongly advocate for the initial study of anomaly detection and outlier detection within the photovoltaic domain. Furthermore, this study identified a minimum of 26 occurrences of \u201canomaly detection\u201d and 15 occurrences of \u201coutlier detection\u201d, making it significant enough to initiate crucial research processes in this field. In recent developments, new algorithms have shown promising outcomes in detecting faults in photovoltaic systems. One notable algorithm, discussed in the article titled \u201cOnline Fault Diagnosis for Photovoltaic Arrays Based on Fisher Discrimination Dictionary Learning for Sparse Representation\u201d [295], deserves special mention. 8 Challenges and key elements in research and applications In this review, it is noted that despite the variety of machine learning techniques accessible, most studies use conventional methods. This study seeks to overcome this limitation by conducting a thorough analysis and highlighting crucial aspects and obstacles. The objective is to inspire new research initiatives that can enhance fault diagnosis in photovoltaic systems. The upcoming sections will elaborate on these important aspects and challenges. 8.1 Key elements The list of key elements identified in this study, necessary to advance the field of interest, is divided into three main aspects based on their affinity: i) AI for fault diagnosis in photovoltaic systems; ii) Monitoring focused on fault diagnosis; and iii) Formal fault dictionary. These three aspects are described in the following. 8.1.1 AI for fault diagnosis in photovoltaic systems To adequately address a problem of fault diagnosis in photovoltaic systems using artificial intelligence, it is necessary to first build relevant and robust databases. In other words, these databases should include at least the following eight key elements. First, it is essential to determine the data collection level . This involves specifying whether the algorithm will be applied at the level of individual photovoltaic panels, photovoltaic string aggregates, protection systems, and so on. Second, you need to define the nature of the input data for the algorithm . This entails deciding whether the algorithm will work with data types like characteristic curves, electrical signals including voltage, current, power, time-dependent meteorological data, images, etc. Third, you must establish the sampling rate . The sampling rate is crucial and depends on the type of fault to be detected. Some faults occur rapidly, within a minute or less (such as arc faults), while others might take as long as 15 minutes or even weeks to manifest (like degradation faults). Thus, a balance between sampling frequency and data storage and processing capacity is essential. Furthermore, a fourth consideration is generalizing photovoltaic models . The accuracy of machine learning diagnostic results is heavily influenced by the quality of the training data. In other words, if the algorithm is trained on a specific dataset A and then used to diagnose data from a completely different photovoltaic plant, even if the data types are similar, the diagnostic results are likely to be inaccurate. Therefore, it is important to develop data preprocessing algorithms that can standardize the data from the two plants for comparison. These algorithms help to generalize the input data for the machine learning algorithm, taking into account factors like the operating time of the photovoltaic plant, inclination, orientation, the number of photovoltaic panels per string, photovoltaic technology, and more. The fifth aspect is the diagnostic window . It is important to determine the time interval during which the diagnosis will be performed in order to avoid hiding specific behaviors of a fault type. For example, calculating the average signal over an entire day of data versus a minute can significantly change the diagnostic result. This selection should depend on the specific fault to be diagnosed. The sixth aspect is multi domain data fusion . Some faults in photovoltaic systems have a unique thermal signature (hotspot), while others have an electrical signature (premature aging). Therefore, in some cases, it is necessary to fuse data from multiple domains. This data fusion can significantly increase the range of detectable faults. It can even transition the diagnostic approach from corrective maintenance to preventive maintenance as proposed in [296]. The seventh aspect is feature engineering , which had around 48 occurrences within the documents analyzed in this study. As some faults exhibit thermal signatures and other electrical signatures, some faults may not be clearly visible in the time domain, requiring a set of signal processing techniques to extract those hidden behaviors. Treatments such as Fourier transforms, wavelet analysis, etc., can be explored. Finally, the eighth aspect is the execution architecture of the diagnostic algorithm . This aspect allows understanding the framework in which the algorithm will operate, such as limitations of the computational processor, memory, and storage, among others. 8.1.2 Monitoring focused on fault diagnosis As mentioned earlier in this study, the diagnostic outcome is directly proportional to the quality of training data. For this reason, this study presents a set of nine key elements that can improve photovoltaic system monitoring focused on fault diagnosis. Firstly, the diagnostic algorithm execution mechanism plays a crucial role. The way the diagnostic algorithm is executed directly defines the structure and constitution of the monitoring system. If the algorithm is embedded within the monitoring system, it is necessary to consider the storage capacity and processing capability . On the other hand, if the algorithm is hosted on a server, the monitoring system will only be responsible for data acquisition, and in that case the most important aspect is the data transmission protocol . This protocol must ensure the timely transmission of data without significant delays, discrepancies, or lost/aberrant data during the transfer. Furthermore, it should ensure the continuity of data transmission. Another crucial consideration regarding monitoring is the identification of measurable variables. This involves specifying the sensors to be used, while also considering the potential for combining data. This entails thinking about sensors for measuring electrical and meteorological parameters, and even thermal or electroluminescence imagery. International standards have been established to simplify the planning of photovoltaic (PV) monitoring systems and to assist in the choice of sensor types and quantities. These standards establish criteria for monitoring photovoltaic facilities. For instance, the British standard BS IEC 61724 [297], the recommendations of the European Joint Research Center [298], and the guidelines of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [299] provide comprehensive guidance for assessing the performance of photovoltaic systems. One more factor to consider is the operation environment of the monitoring system . In cases where the system is placed in a high-capacity solar power facility, it is important to be aware that certain plants might not have wireless networks like WiFi available for data transfer. Additionally, in some cases, there may not be electrical outlets available to power the monitoring system. Therefore, the system must be self-sufficient in terms of energy and adapt to the absence of electrical outlets. Consequently, the monitoring system should have an integrated power source capable of supplying the necessary power to ensure continuous data acquisition. The fourth aspect is noise robustness . Fault diagnosis algorithms using artificial intelligence are highly sensitive to noise. Hence, monitoring systems must be protected against electromagnetic interference from the environment (such as the presence of parasitic currents) that can disrupt the captured signals. The fifth aspect to take into account when addressing data management and data privacy is the necessity for a strong cybersecurity element within the system. This implies that the system should have the capability to encrypt the data collected at the photovoltaic station to safeguard it from being stolen. Lastly, the portability of the monitoring system must be defined. Taking into account the aforementioned aspects, it is necessary to determine whether the monitoring system will be continuously connected to the photovoltaic system or if it will only be connected for periodic diagnostic purposes. This aspect directly affects the dimensioning of both the internal elements of the monitoring system and the associated power supply. 8.1.3 Formal fault dictionary One of the significant challenges in fault diagnosis algorithms employing supervised artificial intelligence involves the need to label training data accurately and to achieve a deep understanding of occurring faults. These two aspects are closely intertwined, as comprehensive knowledge of fault behavior is essential for data labeling. Typically, this process relies on traditional fault identification methods conducted in a lab setting or with input from field experts. Nonetheless, numerous issues are associated with this approach, including disagreements regarding fault classification and disparities between lab-identified fault conditions and those encountered in the field. Using the information extracted from the articles reviewed in this study, this section proposes essential components to consider when establishing a formal fault dictionary for photovoltaic systems, with a primary focus on fault diagnosis and labeling. A label, in this context, refers to the specific designation for the operational state of a photovoltaic panel or string, such as \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201chot spot,\u201d or \u201cdelamination\u201d. The critical aspects that the fault dictionary should cover are described below. First, the dictionary should include the component where the fault occurs . In other words, it should define whether faults occur at the level of photovoltaic cells, photovoltaic panels, photovoltaic strings, photovoltaic arrays, protective systems, etc. Along the same lines, as a second key aspect, the dictionary should be capable of providing information about the origin of the fault . For example, differentiating between faults of structural, electrical, and thermal origins, among others. In addition, it should define whether the origin is related to external causes, material aging, or other factors. The third key aspect identified in this study that should be part of the dictionary is the relationship between faults . It is becoming increasingly evident that fault diagnosis systems need to be more powerful and computationally lighter. Therefore, the fault dictionary needs to group faults not only based on the component where they occur but also considering the cause-and-effect relationships between them. For example, if there are microcrack faults that can later lead to hot spots. This is crucial for the future of fault diagnosis in photovoltaic systems because it allows focusing efforts only on detecting the cause (microcracks) rather than the symptoms (hot spots), ensuring high diagnostic performance and maximizing the number of diagnosed faults. A fourth aspect that should be explored is the occurrence frequency . This aspect will help identify diagnostic windows. Defining the effects on fault occurrence based on factors such as the age of the power plant, the meteorological conditions under which the system is installed, or even the technology used. A fifth aspect to consider within the dictionary is an analysis of the priority level in terms of power loss and human safety. Understanding this priority allows corrective or preventive actions to be taken based on the level of risk for the photovoltaic plant or the personnel within the photovoltaic plant. Lastly, this study is considered a sixth key element to study conventional fault detection methods . The objective is for these methods to be used in a second phase to validate and refine the results of the fault diagnosis. 8.2 Challenges In this study, it has been noted that the diagnosis of faults in photovoltaic systems with the help of artificial intelligence must shift towards obtaining pertinent real-world data for fault monitoring and detection. This necessitates a departure from the traditional model-based training, which entails creating mathematical representations of systems, and instead embracing data-driven training systems or models built from actual data. This change ensures a more accurate representation of the system, leading to improved and more applicable responses from machine learning systems. Nonetheless, as previously stated, the key to obtaining reliable results that account for real-world disturbances caused by environmental factors and measurement device signal noise lies in prioritizing the acquisition of high-quality data. The use of pure algorithms is becoming progressively challenging. Hence, researchers are encouraged to explore hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of various algorithms, facilitated by the concept of the \u2018master algorithm\u2019. By bridging the gap between different algorithmic groups, researchers can extract the optimal outcomes from each approach. Furthermore, it is essential not only to develop a comprehensive fault detection algorithm capable of functioning in diverse conditions but also to conduct rigorous mathematical work. This mathematical understanding will facilitate a deeper understanding of the relationships between photovoltaic systems and weather conditions, such as temperature, irradiation, humidity, and others. Through this understanding, a set of equations can be derived, enabling comparison of performance and fault detection even when evaluating plants installed under variable conditions. In addition to these aspects, it is interesting to highlight that the Cluster (1-5) have been widely used for fault detection purposes. Meanwhile, Cluster 6 has been used as a complement to the other clusters, enhancing overall performance by optimizing the algorithm hyperparameters. However, it is important to note that within each cluster, supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches can be found. This underscores the necessity of careful attention to data labeling used for system training. The challenge of effectively labeling the data to diagnose faults in photovoltaic systems represents one of the main contemporary challenges. 9 Discussion and conclusions The proposed methodology in this study introduces, for the first time, a way to extract a set of conditions and trends from a considerable number of documents regarding fault detection in photovoltaic systems. This aspect had never been clearly established before using a methodology based on numerous bibliometric analyses. Consequently, the methodology applied to photovoltaic systems could serve as a valuable tool for researchers approaching scientific topics from a Big Data perspective. In this study, over 620 research papers on fault detection in photovoltaic systems that use artificial intelligence were identified and analyzed. Articles that only presented frameworks without including experimental research were excluded from consideration. This research introduces a method for performing a literature review that integrates bibliometric content analysis with expert qualitative content analysis. This method attempts to identify essential parameters, obstacles, and research perspectives to support and guide upcoming studies in the domain of fault detection in photovoltaic systems. Furthermore, it offers a comprehensive collection of algorithms and relevant papers grouped together to enhance understanding of the various categories of algorithms to be explored in future research. Multiple relevant aspects for future research were obtained. First, this study recommends the research of hybrid machine learning and comparative studies of these methods in fault detection in photovoltaic systems. Second, research on photovoltaic system forecasting should be encouraged to enable condition-based preventive maintenance and reduce investment recovery times. While industrial demands tend to focus on complete photovoltaic arrays, monitoring at the photovoltaic panel level still requires significant development and should progress alongside machine learning algorithms. Third, the current challenge is not only the construction of more robust photovoltaic systems but also ensuring their optimal production. In this regard, this study recommends diligent research on the construction of robust databases and specialized signal processing for early fault diagnosis. Additionally, this study, as demonstrated in Section 5.1, identifies highly interesting countries or target countries for establishing collaborative networks. For example, China, India, and the United States are countries that dominate most of the research in the field of study. Interestingly, this methodology also highlights France as a country of interest. With approximately 15% publications compared to China, India, or the United States, France surpasses India in terms of citations and achieves roughly half the citations of China or the United States. Therefore, this study encourages close monitoring of efforts on artificial intelligence and renewable energy topics within these four countries. This study also demonstrated the need for the design of photovoltaic monitoring systems to be adapted to the new requirements of Industry 4.0 and Big Data. This means constructing new monitoring systems capable of hosting artificial intelligence for forecasting, tracking, anomaly detection, and health state diagnostics, among other functions. Additionally, these systems should demonstrate high performance in terms of data transmission, processing speeds, storage, multi domain data, and other aspects outlined in the key elements section. The detailed analysis conducted in this study made it evident that there is no consensus on a general classification of faults in photovoltaic systems. Therefore, this study proposed a set of key aspects that would enable future fault diagnosis research to follow a unified path, accelerating progress and facilitating collaborative work and direct algorithm extrapolation. Finally, the research findings validate the importance of ongoing efforts by researchers to create novel algorithms and tools for fault detection in photovoltaic systems with the aid of artificial intelligence. This will help offer a comprehensive and objective perspective on the current state of sustainable AI research in the energy sector.

Considering the benefits of AI in today\u2019s world, businesses must move towards using Integrated AI tools and services. This paper introduces a business model based on AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS), which provides an integrated bundle of AI products and services. The strategic approach, roadmap, and heuristic pricing model provided in this paper can be considered as a benchmark for AIaaS companies.

The main reason behind this significant growth should be associated with the human need and desire to automate, optimize and increase the accuracy of activities that are generally performed by human labor. Therefore, the main problem of artificial intelligence is to build a machine that can think and behave like a human in performing one or more specific activities and thus achieve a degree of intelligence [1]. An intelligent machine can solve a problem with a specific purpose in mind using data received from its environment and its learning power built by an algorithm [2]. According to [3] the capabilities of artificial intelligence systems can be addressed by considering two important dimensions: reasoning\u2013behavior dimension and human performance\u2013rationality dimension. Accordingly, there are four types of artificial intelligence systems: (1) Systems that think like humans, (2) Systems that act like humans, (3) Systems that think rationally, (4) Systems that act rationally. Each of these types of intelligent systems can appear in different business applications and meet different industrial and commercial needs. The capabilities and opportunities of artificial intelligence have received much attention in the digital age and this branch of technology is considered as one of the main axes of digital evolution. It can be said that the advances made in artificial intelligence are the focal point in increasing the performance of other technologies and the evolution of the Industry 4.0 [4]. Various research works have shown that artificial intelligence technology provides new opportunities which can cause significant changes in business and greatly affect their economy [5\u20139]. Different fields such as manufacturing and construction, energy and utilities, sales, marketing, supply chain management, finance, education, health and entertainment use the tremendous capabilities of artificial intelligence to increase efficiency, automate processes, reduce labor costs and thus increase their return on investment (ROI). As shown in a study by [10], AI can even have an impact on human resources digitization in the Industry 4.0. On the other hand, the speedy growth of the Internet and cloud computing technologies has led to a dramatic change in various forms of business creating e-business, e-commerce, e-health, e-learning and similar forms. Therefore, essential elements and requirements such as e-signature, e-order, e-payment, mobile banking has been emerged to advance the goals and improve the performance of these areas [9,11]. Also, due to the speed of generation and dissemination of data and information, business environments must use big data technologies to be able to process and extract knowledge contained in them to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the business [12]. Predictive data analytics has become more prevalent, especially in financial sectors, banking processes and security fields. Artificial intelligence methods, especially machine learning and deep learning play a very crucial role in discovering hidden patterns in data and creating predictive capability from them [13,14]. The use of robots, especially in the aerospace, manufacturing, automotive, health, and process automation for different domains, has grown significantly and more businesses have begun to use robotic capabilities in their operations. Recently the explainable AI has shifted the area to even become more effective and transparent by providing explanations on AI or machine learning methods\u2019 interior design and how they come into a decision or predictions for human users [15]. Considering the benefits of artificial intelligence in today\u2019s world and the rapid growth of its functions, it seems necessary for any type of business to move towards the use of artificial intelligence tools to improve performance and quality, increase ROI, and reduce costs. In fact, artificial intelligence has grown so much that its impact is visible on all aspects of businesses, and avoiding its use leads to being left behind competitors and losing a lot of profits. As a result, the number of enterprises using AI in business grew by 270% between 2015 and 2019, according to Gartner [16]. Based on the implications of the recent surge in AI technologies and its opportunities and challenges in association with digital transformation, [17] introduced an AI readiness assessment framework by considering four key dimensions: technologies, activities, boundaries, and goals. Findings from McKinsey\u2019s 2021 survey indicate that AI adoption is continuing its steady growth: 56 percent of all respondents reported AI adoption in at least one function, up from 50 percent in 2020. The newest results suggest that AI adoption since last year has increased most at companies headquartered in emerging economies, including China, the Middle East and North Africa [18]. According to McKinsey\u2019s survey, AI adoption in the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s first year brought up to more than 20 percent reduction in business functions while revenue increases were above 10 percent. It is clear the successful companies\u2019 investments in AI will continue to increase over the next three years and more companies need to focus on integrating their business model with AI. While the global AI\u2019s market size was valued at USD 328.34 billion in 2021, the market is projected to grow from USD 387.45 billion in 2022 to USD 1,394.30 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 20.1% during the forecast period [19]. To take advantage of such a promising space created by artificial intelligence, companies can act in two ways: \u2022 Adopt and incorporate AI in business-related processes, operations, and services, \u2022 Use AI as the key component of their business model and provide AI products and services to other businesses. The first case is something that can be seen in most companies today and was mentioned in the statistics above. But the bottom line is that for a company to enjoy the benefits of artificial intelligence, it must receive artificial intelligence products and services from another company which specializes in AI modern technologies. There are few companies which can create AI applications with their development units. Therefore, according to the second case, there should be companies that can provide artificial intelligence services and products in accordance with the needs of businesses. In fact, in this case, the provision of artificial intelligence products and services can be included in a business model and the main profit of the provider company is created in this way [20,21]. Such a business model is called Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS). AIaaS is a new method that, like cloud services, provides artificial intelligence services and solutions according to the needs of companies and with subscription payment models or payment on demand [22]. Often these services are provided in the form of APIs and companies can receive any AI services such as machine learning models, natural language processing, image processing, etc. whenever the need. The advantages of this type of service for user companies are: (I) No need for specialized skills of artificial intelligence; (II) Tested and high-speed infrastructure; (III) Transparent payment models in terms of use; (IV) Usability; and (V) Scalability. This paper presents a case study to introduce a business model and plan based on the second case. The business plan is defined according to AIaaS model by providing an integrated package of artificial intelligence products and services to companies and organizations in need. Products and services in this package are defined using modern technologies and based on customer needs with the ability to be customized and adjusted according to other commercial needs as well. It is noteworthy that numerous studies have formerly scrutinized the commercialization and business modeling process of research-based products. Accordingly, [23] developed a notable framework to associate science and engineering research with commercial outcomes in terms of a seamless transition from research to business. From a more holistic viewpoint [24] performed a literature review of disruptive innovation. They developed a multilevel theoretical framework to examine its firm-level influence factors and aspects, particularly in the commercialization process. [25] explored the disruptors\u2019 business model innovation activities to evidence the relationships between dynamic capabilities and value proposition innovation. The business model here is outlined in terms of a case study in one of the leading Asian companies in the field of information technology. 1 1 FANAP Co., Pardis Technology Park, Tehran, Iran. https://fanap.ir. The company\u2019s software products and services are designed and ready to be used in order to take advantage of the capabilities of new technologies to improve the business environment. In designing these tools, the most up-to-date machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence have been used, and the design of the services has been done is such a way that they have the required flexibility to be adopted in monitoring, management, functional and customer relationship management systems. The commercialization package of AIaaS, has its contribution anchored in the integrated promotion of AI products and applications for exterior enterprises in terms of open innovation ecosystem. The strategic approach and systematic roadmap provided here can be considered as a potent tool and experience to pave the way for similar projects within the field of information and communication technology. Hence, the enterprises providing AIaaS are potentially considered as the specific audiences of this study. Our case study focuses on three important elements of the company\u2019s AIaaS business plan: Business roadmap to achieve main objectives, AIaaS package specifications, and the commercialization action plan and linchpin. The rest of paper is structured as follows: In the next section, related work on AIaaS is presented for the reader to better introduce this emerging field. In Section 3, the business model that is formed based on the package of AI services is described. Then the roadmap, strategy and the requirement behind this model is presented. In Section 4, the structure of the AI package, the included services and their relationships are described. Then a brief description of the features of the services and products in the three categories of machine vision, natural language processing, and data-driven systems is provided. We also present a summary of the applications of each individual service in the business domains. In Section 5, we describe the commercialization approach and the measures taken to facilitate the journey of the services to the market with standard methodologies. In Section 6, we conclude the paper with some suggestions on future works. 2 Related work Artificial Intelligence-as-a-Service (AIaaS) has emerged as a transformative business model that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to provide scalable and accessible AI solutions to various industries. In this section, we present some of the most recent advancements and trends in the field of AIaaS, highlighting its potential benefits, challenges, and implications. The following studies shed light on the current state of AIaaS and how it can be adopted in different domains. AIaaS refers to the provision of AI capabilities and resources as on-demand services through the cloud, enabling organizations to leverage AI technologies without the need for significant upfront investments in infrastructure and expertise [26]. In order to deepen the understanding of AIaaS, [27] published a catchword article to define AIaaS stack and its hierarchical software/developer/infrastructure layers, discuss its core characteristics, and elaborate on its open socio-technical challenges and future research directions. [28] provided a systematic review of the AIaaS space by proposing a taxonomy of AI services based on the levels of autonomy afforded to the user. They examined the different categories of AIaaS, outlining how these services can lead to biases or be otherwise harmful in the context of end-user applications. The importance of deploying on-premise AIaaS Service for small and medium size companies was studied by [29]. The authors investigated the AIaaS functionality and corresponding technology stack and analyzed possible realizations using open-source user friendly technologies that are suitable for on-premise setups allowing full control over their data, processes and costs, where this is needed, without any third-party dependence or vendor lock-in. Since some of the major concerns in migrating to AIaaS models are privacy, security and compression of the data, [30] proposed an optimized algorithm for providing Data Compression, Data Integrity and Data Confidentiality of the AIaaS deployments. AIaaS platforms usually have an online repository containing a bunch of ML services and tools where users can access and choose what satisfy their needs. The challenge is that selecting the optimal ML model or AI service is now always an easy task. In order to tackle this challenge, a dynamic approach was proposed by [31] for selecting the most appropriate ML model using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method in a specific use case of energy consumption forecasting. In order to highlight the importance of AIaaS in today\u2019s world, one must examine the emerging applications of this new business model. Various applications in different industries and businesses can be imagined for this model. One promising domain is autonomous driving. [32] designed and developed an AI-as-a-Service toolkit for an autonomous driving personalization system according to the output of an automatic driver\u2019s stress recognition algorithm in the context of a cyber physical system. They implemented a data-gathering subsystem to collect data from different sensors such as wearables and cameras, to automatize stress recognition. They also used different learning algorithm to provide proper functionality in the subsystems. AIaaS has also been applied for preventing the spread of immoral content in social networks [33]. AIaaS can use effective cloud computing and ML models for immoral content detection and eradication. It is highly adaptable, dynamic, and mostly effective for optimizing the outcomes based on big data training data samples. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to diagnose the disease from chest X-ray images has been expanded. But one of the basic challenges of this field is the need for special and powerful computing resources for image processing. Therefore, the model of AIaaS can be used to reduce costs and eliminate the need for special computing tools, and medical diagnosis can also be made from inexpensive tools such as mobile phones. [34] proposed a new AIaaS architecture to deliver AI models for embodiment on low-cost devices. They demonstrated the suitability of their architecture through a case study of COVID-19 diagnosis using a low-cost device. There are also some challenges related to deployment architecture, working mechanism design, and performance optimization challenges specific to AI as a Service (AIaaS) in edge computing environments. AIaaS, supported by edge computing, offers the advantage of delivering AI capabilities with guaranteed low latency. This enables the swift implementation of data-intensive and computation-intensive AI applications, while also reducing customer investment costs. To address the challenge, [35] proposed a configurable model deployment architecture for edge AIaaS and presented a flexible working mechanism by enabling the joint configuration of data quality ratios and model complexity ratios for the AI tasks. Along with commonly used resource allocation operations, they could improve the energy and delay performance of AI services with the desired quality of results. 3 Business roadmap for an AIaaS provider Business roadmap is a key element in the business strategy that every organization must design to create value enabling growth and development in a competitive environment. The company in our case study has proved itself as one of the top companies in the information and communication technology market in Asia. In order to achieve the strategic goals of the organization and create the top digital ecosystem in the country. this company has designed an AIaaS business model which provides a wide variety of products and services in respond to the ever-changing business requirements of the companies in different industries. The artificial intelligence services in the company, also known as AIFA, 2 2 Artificial Intelligence of Fanap. is the main unit in the company which is responsible for developing various AI software products and services with the support of high knowledge and experience of the company\u2019s software development unit. AIFA\u2019s software products and services are designed and ready to be used in order to take advantage of the capabilities of new technologies to improve the business environment. In line with the company\u2019s vision, which is defined as \u201cthe platform for creating the future\u201d, the AIFA team also has a vision that introduces it as the \u201cartificial intelligence momentum for business transformation\u201d in the region. When a business plan for AI services is to be defined on a large scale, it is necessary to design a clear roadmap for it to determine the objectives and direction of movements. For this purpose, a two-year roadmap for AIFA\u2019s services was determined, which its main objectives are displayed in Fig. 1. In Section 3.1 , each of the four AIFA\u2019s main objectives for the two proceeding years are described in detail from the perspective of \u201cMarketing and Business Model Design (MBMD)\u201d. Next, AIFA main objectives are explicated in terms of \u201cStakeholders\u2019 Responsiveness\u201d and \u201cSelling Products\u201d respectively in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 . 3.1 AIFA MBMD objectives 3.1.1 Using open innovation approaches to improve the performance of AI services Open innovation seems to be an appealing idea for companies seeking for competency in the growing markets. It can be defined as \u201cthe use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and to expand the markets for external use of innovation, respectively\u201d [36]. Therefore, the use of open innovation was regarded as a key factor to heighten the performance of AI services and make them more competent in the market. The organizational antecedents of a successful open business model in the ICT-based sectors were identified by [37] regarding the benefits of open innovation. In order to achieve this objective, solutions were developed in two categories: cognitive factors and physical factors. Cognitive factors include developing market knowledge through monitoring industry and competitors, evaluating the potential of the company and its intelligent macro platforms, participating in events, and networking with other ecosystem actors such as universities, research institutes, innovation centers, knowledge-based startups. In the category of physical factors, the justifiability of creating joint consortia was examined, a market research team was formed with the mission of receiving service feedback and increasing customer satisfaction, and RFPs for new needs of the company were developed based on existing markets. Activities such as correspondence with organizations, piloting services, preparing promotional and white papers, producing content on the website and social networks, and designing catalogs, videos, and infographics to market the developed services were on the agenda of the AIFA commercialization team. 3.1.2 Supplementation and implementation of performance improvement measures Developing AI services is at the heart of our business model. This is something that is adding value to the company. In this regard, previous experiences and environmental developments were put on the agenda in order to improve the movement in the direction of strategies, agility in providing responds, avoiding insist on implementing incorrect strategies, and avoiding blindly following competitors. Also, the implementation of AI services on a robot named Pepper was also on the agenda as a pilot to determine the feedback on the development of services and to further enhance the capabilities of services in the field of robotics. 3.1.3 Networking in order to brand AIFA services Networking for branding products and services is one of the critical measures that are considered in the early stages of start-up businesses. [38] analyzed how business networks and growth orientation effects on the novelty orientation value propositions for technology-based firms. Participating in conferences, exhibitions and invitations, holding business meetings, holding specialized webinars, and networking with planners through the publication of open problems were some of the activities for AIFA branding put on the agenda in this step. In order to accelerate the recognition and promotion of the brand of AIFA services, digital marketing activities in cyberspace, SEO implementation and producing specialized content, preparing promotional articles in magazines, and holding specialized events and webinars were other activities in this step of AIFA commercialization project. 3.1.4 Market penetration via business intelligence solutions Learning about the market and receiving feedback on the use of services is a vital matter in order to promote as many products as possible with the purpose of improving customer satisfaction. These measures were put on the agenda in the next step for the commercialization of AIFA services. Commercialization of AI services through the implementation of services on an interactive and social robot is another issue that is on the agenda to increase awareness of AIFA services in the market. In AIFA roadmap, two more perspectives other than MBMD are considered for the business including \u201cresponsiveness to stakeholders\u201d and \u201cselling products\u201d as discussed next. 3.2 AIFA objectives in terms of stakeholders\u2019 responsiveness One of the main roadmap perspectives of AIFA is to achieve the satisfaction of the stakeholders and shareholders. To satisfy this perspective, some important measures were taken in the business model such as creating revenue-generating services in the AI market, creating a branded business in the growing field of AI, developing the company\u2019s artificial intelligence brand, focusing on scalability in developing AIFA revenues, and focusing on creating value for all stakeholders. This perspective and the related activities are satisfiable in terms of the main four objectives in the AIFA roadmap for the two proceeding years, as depicted in Fig. 2. 3.3 AIFA objectives in terms of selling products By selling AIFA services via different solutions in terms of API-based approaches, startup studio, co-creation, B2B, B2G, B2B2C, and also by participating in organizational tenders, it is expected to generate a proper amount of revenue for the AIFA business to compensate for a percentage of costs. This is considered as a set of milestones in the spin-off process of the research center. Moreover, it is regarded as an objective in AIFA roadmap from the perspective of selling products. 4 AI services in the AIFA package AIFA artificial intelligence services are designed to meet a wide range of business needs in the Middle East region. In designing these services, state-of-the-art technologies, reliability, scalability and customizability have been considered to cover different customers with different degrees of concern and to be able to gain a competitive advantage in the market. An important consideration in the design and development of artificial intelligence services is that there must be a reasonable relationship between the services so that customers who use a specific service do not go to another vendor if they need any related or similar services. Therefore, customer loyalty can be shaped by providing diverse and related services. In this section, we describe the types of services provided and their application in businesses. Fig. 3 shows the high-level structure of the AIFA AI services. The coherence among the services plays an important role for satisfying customer needs and improving their business performance. Generally, the AIFA AI services and products are provided in three categories: data-driven systems, machine vision, and natural language processing. 4.1 AIFA\u2019s data-driven systems Data-driven systems can provide the analytics and detection capabilities based on real-time or history data related to a particular application. These systems receive large amounts of data and learn the interesting patterns that might be needed to detect something or predict an event. The detection systems can be used in Financial Services [39,40], Health Care [41], Information Security [42], and so forth. The data-driven systems provided by AIFA include three important services: \u2022 Crowd-sourcing-based Data Labeling system: The mission of this product is to create a suitable data feed to complete the time-consuming and expensive component of machine learning algorithms, namely data labeling. As a multi-sided platform, this system brings together two or more groups of users: intelligence experts who need tagged data, and non-expert taggers. Two different datasets are already deployed in this system: textual sentiment analysis dataset, and celebrities\u2019 image-labeling dataset. \u2022 Fraud Detection system: Using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, the system can identify abnormalities in patterns and help detect fraud in financial processes. \u2022 Path Planning: This service is developed with the aim of finding the shortest path in a network of defined nodes. 4.1.1 Data labeling service Data labeling is one of the fundamental steps in data collection and preparation aimed at defining and differentiating data. Generally, the data used in a particular application is enormous, but the belongness of data samples to a specific class may not be known beforehand. As an example, most automated systems designed to recognize and detect the sensation of images and sounds require a significant number of labeled instances of objects to be taught automatically using artificial intelligence models. Learning models designed by machine learning algorithms are properly trained if the input data is of high quality and accuracy. Since the data required for supervised learning algorithms requires sample data labeled with classes, their labeling must be determined before implementing any type of supervised algorithm. Determining labels and validating them manually is a tedious and time-consuming task. Therefore, one way to do that is to delegate it to the people through crowd-sourcing [43]. In this way, the accuracy of the input data is evaluated by human knowledge and then high-quality data is used as input for machine learning algorithms. Although the purpose of labeling is to validate input data, it varies depending on the type of data sets. The AIFA crowd-sourcing data labeling service was founded by the AIFA team with the mission of providing an efficient platform for completing this time-consuming and costly component of machine learning process. The main focus of this service is on the key role of humans in helping to improve the speed, accuracy and quality of data that is used as an input to artificial intelligence algorithms. The labeling service can provide labeling platforms for different use cases such as datasets for recognizing emotions in texts (sentiment analysis) [44], image processing (e.g., face emotion detection), object detection, cancer detection by CT-scans, etc. For example, in the sentiment analysis dataset, the reader\u2019s sense is captured when reading some pre-written sentences. In the celebrity datasets, the image of the celebrity whose name is asked in the question is selected by clickers. Finally, the accuracy of the labeled information is evaluated and used in machine learning algorithms. Fig. 4 shows an example of the questions posed for data tagging in the Celebrity Dataset. 4.1.2 Fraud detection service The rapid growth of e-commerce and the digitalization of financial processes have benefited human society in many ways. But this growth could be a breeding ground for fraud. With the COVID-19 epidemic, online shopping grew at an unprecedented rate, fueling the explosive growth of complex scams and fraudulent transactions. An overview of existing fraud detection and prevention frameworks from a customer-side point of view was presented by [45]. Due to the importance of this issue in business, the AIFA team developed an intelligent fraud detection system. Using big data infrastructure, this system allows for high distribution and scalability of large volumes of banking data. In designing the fraud detection system, various machine learning methods have been used, including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. This system can also detect anomalies in transaction data. On application of fraud detection system is for detecting fraud in transactions related to bank debit cards. In addition to the fixed rules of the central bank, including the time and place of transactions, the 32 rules of the company based on the number and volume of transactions and the account balance of the customer were used in the system. Also, a number of behavioral abnormalities of the card based on the profile of each card is examined. Then a score is calculated for each transaction showing the probability of being suspicious. The transaction processing infrastructure is designed to detect fragmented transactions in a distributed manner so that the service can support bulk data. This system has been developed in three layers: \u2022 Offline layer: Suspicious cases are detected based on the sum and average of deposits, withdrawals in daily, weekly, monthly, and multi-month time periods. \u2022 Semi-offline layer: The information which is available immediately after the final record of the transaction is analyzed. \u2022 Online layer: Abnormal behaviors are detected by investigating transactions based on data such as behavioral history. 4.1.3 Path planning service In intra-urban or extra-urban cargo transportation systems, if there is more than one destination, finding the optimal route between the destinations is important. In other words, how and in what order we choose destinations is very important. Momentary traffic in the routes as well as the existence of different routes between the destinations can be reasons for the importance of the order in which they are selected. In the simplest case, the cost can be considered as the length of the path, and the optimal path can actually be the shortest path. It means that the person responsible for transporting the goods would visit all the destinations and finally would travel the shortest possible distance. But today, with traffic, congestion, and other blockages in each route, the optimal route is not only obtained by the shortest paths, but also by the paths that can be traveled faster in terms of time. AIFA\u2019s Path Planning service is able to receive the information about the destinations and the route between them as well as the cost of each route and provide us with the optimal order of navigation through destinations. This service receives destination and route information in the form of a weighted graph and provides the optimal route in the form of a sequence of nodes and edges. 4.2 AIFA services in machine vision Machine vision is a rapidly growing branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables the extraction of valuable information from various visual inputs, including images and videos [46]. It relies heavily on algorithms that transform tacit information from visual data to knowledge and uses image analysis for any purposes that the user might have. What sets machine vision apart from computer vision is the heavy reliance on specific hardware such as processor, sensor, camera, and so on. Machine vision has wide applications in various industrial, financial and commercial sectors. In this section the AIFA services for responding the customer needs in this area are explained. 4.2.1 Digital authentication via face recognition Face recognition system is a technology capable of recognizing and verifying the face of a person in a digital photo or video, which is usually able to identify the face of people with high accuracy using deep learning algorithms. This technology has received a great deal of attention in recent years in areas such as banking and payment, information security, law enforcement, and sales and commerce. For face image recognition, the person in an input image is identified according to the information in the database. The database contains features of the faces of identified individuals that are used to better train the model. The added value in this section by the company is that AIFA\u2019s automatic and intelligent face recognition service can be used to localize people\u2019s faces, even in crowded images, and then authenticate them. In addition to face recognition, the intelligent authentication service can recognize the liveness of the received images and in the meantime compare with the images received from other databases such as the registry office. Image liveness detection in this system is done by receiving Motion Captcha from nodding and blinking movements. This method of recognizing liveness is completely superior to other existing methods such as detecting hand gestures or checking random sentences and words read by people. Because in terms of security, it is possible to detect movements only by the recognized face. The method is not dependent on other parts of the person\u2019s body, as it is not possible for other organs have any association with the face. One of the most important applications of this service is the process of online authentication for KYC (know your customer) activity in financial, banking and insurance systems. The hardware required for this system includes three CPU Servers for registering logs, receiving, and processing requests. Fig. 5 shows the authentication service process. 4.2.2 Intelligent attendance system via face recognition The AIFA\u2019s artificial intelligence team has designed an intelligent automatic detection service that can detect people\u2019s faces, even in very crowded images, and identify them. The system is able to detect images of people\u2019s faces among hundreds of millions of registered people, almost in real-time. To increase the accuracy and speed of this system, the best deep learning models and image processing technologies in the world have been used. The face recognition and verification service has the capability to record and save the entry and exit logs and the passage time of people in front of the camera in real-time, which can be used to draw the movement routes of people within an organization or considered area. This output can be provided and reported live in the instant-responding system and with a delay of about 15 min in the offline-responding system. This service requires receiving the personnel codes and photos and preferably a selfie video of them in a specified format. Images in the instant-responding system are constantly received as a stream, and for each frame of the identified people, it logs the entrance time of the people. The instant-responding system is capable of receiving images at a speed of 4 frames per second and a maximum of 4 people per frame. The number of frames, and the number of individuals who can pass in front of the camera in each frame can be increased by upgrading the hardware. The benefits of this service include tracking the movement of people and monitoring their traffic, as well as preventing large congestion of employees when entering or leaving the organization. In the future, this service can also be connected to other systems of organizations such as salary and payment system. This service can be connected to the camera online or offline. The other application of this service is monitoring the security of certain places. 4.2.3 Auto license plate reader Intelligent management of vehicle traffic is one important pillar of urban management, especially in metropolitan areas. It plays an important role in maintaining urban order and security. An intelligent transportation system (ITS) involves the use of information and communication technology to improve the performance of transportations. Its refers to a set of tools, facilities and expertise such as traffic engineering concepts, software, hardware and telecommunications technologies that are used in a coordinated and integrated manner to improve the efficiency and safety of the transportation system [47]. In intelligent traffic systems, different technologies are used, from basic systems such as car navigation and traffic light control systems, traffic signs, speedometers and automatic vehicle number identification systems to more advanced and sophisticated systems. They receive and integrate different information from different sources. Most information systems used for weather, traffic, road, and license plate images, can only observe the information and are not able to save or search information they receive. For license plate numbers, there is a need for an intelligent software that processes the images received from the license plate capturing camera and extracts the license plate text information from its image. AIFA license plate reader (LPR) software is an intelligent software whose task is to identify the numbers and letters in the license plates by the image received from a license plate capturing camera. Using advanced image processing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms, the license plate number is identified in a short time and converted into text with high accuracy. With this system, there is no need to manually enter or identify the license plate number. Some features of this service include the ability to detect the type of vehicle, vehicle speed, and location of reading the license plate. This system can be installed and use in parking systems, urban and freeway terminals, and traffic plans. Other features of the AIFA\u2019s license plate recognition system include 24-h use in all seasons. The license plate reader service detects any number of license plates in the image and returns its information along with its location. It can also detect numbers when the car moves in any of the four directions. Fig. 6 shows an example of a license plate recognition service output. 4.2.4 Smart meter-reading When issuing water, electricity and gas bills in the traditional way, first the meter reading officers go to the customer facility and register the number shown in the subscriber meter. This information is then uploaded to the regional company\u2019s billing systems and during a process, the company proceeds to issue the bill. These bills are then delivered to the subscribers by the bill distribution agents. This operation takes at least 3 to 4 days and creates overhead costs for the company, which includes on-site reading and in-person meeting or sending texts to distribute the bill. If the bill can reach out to the subscriber sooner, the subscriber will pay the bill faster. To solve this challenge, the AIFA team has developed an intelligent meter-reading service. In this service, the subscriber records the meter image through the application and send it to the server for processing. The meter image is then processed using an OCR method, machine vision technologies, and deep learning models, and the numbers related to the subscriber\u2019s energy consumption are returned to the associated company. These numbers are used to produce the consumption bill electronically. A unique feature of this service is its compatibility with more than 30 electricity meter models. In order to use this service, the image of the electricity meter must occupy 90% of the user\u2019s input image according to the standard designed in the software. Accordingly, the graphical environment of the application is displayed to the user in such a way that the user can adjust the image in a relevant box and edit it. When the physical meter surface is clean and the camera angle and the light is desirable, an excellent input is provided for the software. Therefore, adherence to technical standards in order to respond to the requests of all subscribers is very important. The AIFA intelligent meter-reading service can be used in two ways: (1) through a payment mobile application, (2) through an API called by the software of any destination business. This service requires a GPU server, a network platform, a camera, and a database system. 4.2.5 Optical character recognition For most of the organizational processes, identity information such as passport and ID card info is often written down manually. If this is done manually for a large population, it will be very time consuming. Therefore, to make this process more efficient, most organizations use optical character recognition (OCR) systems. Such systems are built using computer algorithms that can transform typed or handwritten text images to their corresponding text characters [48]. Due to the growing importance of digital authentication and its security in smart life, the AIFA team has developed an OCR service for two specific applications: \u2022 ID card OCR: Using efficient deep neural network algorithms, this service has provided a secure and efficient platform for virtual authentication based on national smart ID card. For identity verification, first a photo of the person and an image of the national card belonging to him or her are received. The person\u2019s photo on the national card is received through the authentication application. The OCR service then reads the barcode on the back of the national card, identifies the individual\u2019s national code, and detects the ten-digit code on the national card. AIFA ID Card OCR service is offered for use in mobile operating systems in order easily authenticate the user in banking services, governmental and non-governmental organizations, mobile operators, online businesses and in all diverse service areas where online user authentication is critical for providing services. By minimizing the entry of manual information by the user, this service will improve the customer experience. It should be noted that the national card reader service is a part of the digital authentication service that we explained in Section 4.2.1 . In fact, this service retrieves the extracted information through the web service that connects to the Civil Registration Organization by providing the national code and the ten-digit national card code of the photo stored in the database of the Civil Registration Organization. Then, using image processing algorithms, the image from the query will be matched to a photo taken of the person. If these two images match, the identity of the person will be verified and confirmed. \u2022 Debit/Credit card OCR: Electronic payment based on bank card information is usually a frequent and time-consuming task for bank customers. Of course, automating this process will be very pleasant and satisfactory for customers. It should be noted that the automation of such a process should be done with security concerns in mind to prevent fraud. To solve this problem, the AIFA team has provided a bank card reader service. This service is similar to the ID card reader service and provides OCR tools in a secure context for reading bank card information based on deep neural network algorithms. 4.2.6 Signature verification In today\u2019s world, signatures are usually considered as an identity proof. All documents created for movable or immovable property and identification documents need to be signed. But sometimes signatures are misused by forgers or fraudsters. Signature verification is a practice in order to determine the match between an individual\u2019s original signature and the signature placed in a document, examined by the relevant officers [49]. Many industries such as finance, insurance, forensics as well as public sector organizations use signature verification on a daily basis to verify the identity of individuals in various documents. In order to automate signature verification, advanced deep learning algorithms can be used to perform supervised learning on signature patterns. The company has developed an intelligent signature verification service to prevent counterfeiting and fraud facilitating electronic and in-person authentication. By receiving the link of incoming signatures, this service provides matching or non-matching of signatures as output. In the AIFA\u2019s signature verification system, state of the art methods in image processing and machine learning have been used in order to extract and identify the structural features of individuals\u2019 signatures. The details of the learning model and its architecture have been described by [50]. This system can be used in different platforms and can even be customized for different applications. The signature matching system is asynchronous. After calling the service the URL of two signature images that are to be matched is received. Another input to the system is a packet ID that acts as a tracker. Then, the signature images are downloaded and processed. The output of the service, which indicates the matching or non-matching of the two signatures, will be delivered. This service requires three CPU servers to set up logs, receive, and process requests. 4.2.7 Smart object cropping The dramatic growth of competition in the business world has led companies to use different advertising tools in order to overtake their competitors in the market. For designing digital images, one of the most important tools needed by graphic designers is the cropping tool, which helps them create an attractive and effective image. To this end, the AIFA team has designed a service called \u201cSmart Object Cropping\u201d that can be provided to graphic designers as an effective tool in the digital marketing industry. Using machine learning algorithms, this service detects the objects in the image when the user clicks on them in the image and then crops the selected objects [51]. The smart object cropping service is a practical tool for editing photos in online stores and social networks, so that with this product, designers can edit their desired photos faster and spend less time cutting and deleting unwanted objects. Currently, the designed service is available to customers as SDK and Web-based service. 4.2.8 Inappropriate visual content detection Given the increase in content generated in cyberspace and the spread of their sharing on social networks, it seems necessary to have a tool to detect inappropriate content that is exposed to the public and intelligently restrict access to shared images. The need to use such tools becomes more urgent due to the availability of social networks and Internet-based tools for young people in the age group of children and adolescents. Inappropriate content detection service provides a platform for intelligent and automated filtering of user-generated content on the Internet. Such implemented service by AIFA is called Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content detection which helps us to identify images that are not suitable for use in the workplace or public space. This service is able to analyze images received in different formats with the help of image processing algorithms. The probability that each image belongs to each of the 5 different classes is determined: two classes of healthy content (drawings and neutral) and three classes of inappropriate content (including hentai, porn and nudity). This service is asynchronous and receives a digital image link when called. Photos can be found in a cloud-based storage and then be used to call the service. Finally, after downloading the submitted images and processing them, an output will be ready and sent to the address mentioned in the callback. This service can be used in situations where the user uploads a new image to a web service. It can automatically verify that the image is safe and whether it can be displayed to other users. This service can facilitate the work of administrators in social networking platforms to prevent the submissions of inappropriate images, block inappropriate images for the user profile, and securing the visual media platform to avoid the dissemination of inappropriate content. 4.3 AIFA services in NLP Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that has wide applications in text analysis and knowledge extraction form text content [52] Therefore, it has expanded into various businesses. In this section, three important AIFA services in this field are introduced. 4.3.1 Intelligent Search (IntelliSerch) Most digital interactions today are based on electronic documents sharing. This has made a large number of documents available to people on a daily basis in various fields. In addition, documents are constantly being produced and added, while new documents are usually of greater importance. Thus, one is faced with a wealth of different information in web-based space to find the information he needs in a particular field. Accordingly, today, large companies and organizations use local search engines to improve intra-organizational performance and provide appropriate customer service. In fact, having a customized search engine can dramatically increase the speed and efficiency for finding the desired documents. In order to respond to this need, AIFA has developed the \u201cIntelliSearch\u201d, an intelligent search service, based on various text mining methods. This service provides users with an intelligent search engine with various capabilities. It can be used to easily obtain the desired Persian document in a storage and receive the required result. The service combines input text with other complementary data such as user information and search history to analyze and identify user\u2019s need for better search. One of the most important features of IntelliSearch is text standardization using various natural language processing methods including stemming, normalization, and tokenization. It can also identify the position of words in the text and give them a proportional importance by Term Weightier. The other features are identifying specific names (Name Entity Recognition), extracting keywords and phrases from the text, comprehending the recorded text based on the extracted language model, high speed and accuracy of the service, expandable database and support for Big Data, prioritizing new and relevant content to the user, text processing in various fields, the ability to customize search and display results, and adaptability based on user behavior. Intelligent search service has many use cases, including the ability to customize the search process in different areas of an organization by a centralized service, semantic search in organizational documents and letters, categorization and summarization of letters, intelligent and fast question answering in electronic systems, and search on demand in online stores. 4.3.2 Intelligent Questions Answering (QA) Nowadays, a very high number of users are referring to receive web services from organizations or businesses. This creates a huge number of repetitive questions about how to use online services from users. Thus, the use of organizational services is usually accompanied by various questions, and answering these questions is a time-consuming process for organizations. On the other hand, there are many similar questions and using a common answer for them can reduce the waiting time for an answer. Therefore, in organizations that must answer clients\u2019 frequent questions, an intelligent question answering service can be very helpful. In this regard, NLP methods along with efficient processing technologies can be useful in intelligent systematic answers to questions. These methods include sentiment analysis, word weighting, spell checking, keyword extraction, and word lemmatization. The AIFA intelligent Questions Answering (QA) service has been based built on top of the intelligent search system in order to meet the above needs. There are two main components for this service: The ChatBot service is an intelligent virtual robot that provides a question-and-answer process under a written interaction environment. Also, through the AudioBot service, the user can send his or her question to the system via voice message so that the virtual robot can provide a suitable answer. The QA service answers users\u2019 questions by receiving the subject set and its explanation text. The system can display one or more responses ranked by similarity according to the business needs of the output. In this service, questions are asked by voice or text, and the system automatically gives the best answers with the help of Intelligent Search and deep NLP technologies. By gathering the dataset of frequently asked questions from customers and with the ability to receive data on a large volume scale, this service can respond in real-time. 4.3.3 Inappropriate textual content recognition The pervasiveness and high availability of texts containing inappropriate and uncontrolled content on the web and social networks has created the need to monitor and control the content exposed to the view of children and adolescents. For example, in news websites and social networks, it is important for businesses to detect inappropriate content using filtering services due to the wide variety and scale of comments provided by users. In this way, it is possible to identify and refine texts containing racist, religious and gender-based insults, obscene and immoral words, norm-breaking, deconstructive and anti-value expressions. Inappropriate text content recognition service can provide a platform for intelligent and automated filtering of user-generated content on the Internet. For this purpose, the AIFA\u2019s intelligent detection and refinement service has been provided in the form of two main sub-services: I. inappropriate phrase recognition sub-service II. inappropriate phrase refinement sub-service These two subservices can receive inappropriate words or a combination of them and, while recognizing them, remove these words or phrases from the text. This service can be used in mobile applications, computer games, social networks, blogs, forums, news websites, online shopping websites and online stores, websites and applications for children and adolescents, and advertising networks. Intelligent filtering of comments and captions on social networks is another application of inappropriate text content recognition service. Key features and special advantages of this service include service response time in 10 ms, the ability to work with a dictionary of unconventional words, the ability to add words or phrases, non-dependence on the order of unusual words, the possibility of reviewing large volumes of comments in a short time, high speed of response and recognition of the status of comments and enriching the scope of recognizing unusual expressions using the API. The service is dictionary-based and works with n-grams. 5 AIFA services commercialization Once AIFA\u2019s AIaaS package has been designed, important steps need to be taken to bring them to market. In fact, this is where AI services move from the AIFA lab to the competitive AI market. In order to introduce AI services to the market and attract potential customers, many activities were carried out based on the principles of standard commercialization, which is summarized in this section. In general, the steps of commercialization of software services and products can be summarized as follows: I. Ideation: Meeting the needs of users, and reviewing the idea from the perspective of potential users II. Study the market situation III. Development of business plan IV. Absorb capital V. Software implementation: Planning, process design, solution design, configuration and customization, integration, reporting and documentation, testing, and training VI. Focus on customer retention and interaction: For this purpose, the following steps are taken: \u2022 Advertising: This step includes search engine optimization, email marketing, network marketing, article writing and reporting, preparation of advertising teasers, product introduction in reputable publications and magazines (especially publications in the field of information technology and software development), produce creative videos and motion pictures about the product, its functions and how to use it, use graphic design to show the benefits of the product \u2022 Production of textual content including technical features, capabilities, key product benefits (such as proposal, catalog, brochure, fact sheet, PowerPoint) In order to facilitate the introduction of AIFA services to organizations and create the opportunity to negotiate for sale, first, the documents related to product presentation were designed for product demos separately. These documents include fact sheet, product catalog, reportage and PowerPoint presentations. The posts sent on social networks were designed as short texts to introduce the product and their features along with motion graphics. It was also possible to participate in tenders for some products, which was very helpful in identifying and introducing products to customers and the market. To introduce AI services and features to customers and the market, networking was done with the target organizations. Then letters were prepared and sent to the relevant organizations. Depending on the needs identified in the organizations in question, one or more specific services were introduced to explain the use of the service for the needs of that organization. Therefore, measures were taken in accordance with the standards to introduce services to the market and attract potential customers in several areas. 5.1 Case-based correspondence (to introduce specific services) In this step, letters are sent to introduce a group of AI services to a large number of organizations and companies that can be potential customers of the services. These letters offer various services related to the type of business and processes of the organizations. Table 1 shows the type of businesses that were communicated with and the type of AI services that were introduced. 5.2 General correspondence to introduce the AIFA business In this step, in order to introduce the artificial intelligence group (AIFA) and the type of activities in this group, various private companies and government organizations whose problems can be solved using artificial intelligence are selected. AIFA services ware presented and described to them using various presentation methods such as catalogs and brochures. 5.3 Participation in tenders Taking advantage of the opportunity to participate in tenders in order to actively be identified as a start-up business is very important. Therefore, the products of the AIFA team participated in some selected tenders related to large economic companies which are active in the field of telecommunication and mobile services in order to provide the ground for the introduction of products and services. 5.4 Active presence in social networks In order to better familiarize AIFA services, social pages were created on popular social networks, such as LinkedIn and Instagram. These pages are currently very active, and several posts related to AIFA products have been provided. Various advertising and educational materials related to AIFA services are posted in these pages so that customers from different parts of the community can be informed and contact the company if necessary. 5.5 Pilot and permanent deployments Pilot deployment is a pivotal step in the commercialization of each developed software. In this regard, the AIFA team has managed to deploy the following projects: \u2022 The attendance service based on facial recognition in the company\u2019s premises as well as in the headquarters of banking service provider company \u2022 License plate reading service in the company\u2019s premises \u2022 Digital authentication, ID card OCR, and intelligent question answering services on a social robotic platform \u2022 Intelligent meter-reading service in the company\u2019s proprietary mobile wallet (PayPOD) \u2022 Path planning service for the company\u2019s smart transportation platform (PODRO) \u2022 Inappropriate content detection service in digital banking ecosystem It is noteworthy that AIFA deployment activities are not limited to the mentioned pilot activities. Actually, some AIFA services were deployed as permanent solutions for the customer businesses. these services include but not are limited to the following items: \u2022 Digital authentication via face recognition together with liveness detection in the company\u2019s mobile wallet and in modern banking platform \u2022 data labeling service for continues improvement \u2022 Real-time fraud detection service for banking transactions \u2022 Smart object cropping system in an e-commerce website builder \u2022 Inappropriate textual content recognition in children entertainment field \u2022 IntelliSearch in video-on-demand platforms (smart TV box) and an eCommerce website builder 5.6 Providing services in an API marketplace Starting, developing, and running a business require us to create relations with a large chain of businesses, usually in order to provide basic services, infrastructure and support. Many companies and institutions today offer their online services in the form of APIs to other businesses. This Form of service provision is an agile, secure, easy, and scalable method. Since most of the AIFA services are provided in the form of APIs, these services were provided in an API marketplace designed by the company\u2019s itself. In this marketplace, in addition to the possibility of comparing and reviewing various digital services, developers can receive the services they need and easily implement them using the available transparent documentation. One of the main sections of the API marketplace is artificial intelligence. Providing cost-effective artificial intelligence services helps businesses grow and develop in this area. Services provided in this area can be accessed from the service request section by creating a business account on the marketplace and calling the relevant API. Digital authentication is another section in the marketplace which is mainly supported by AI services and APIs. 5.7 Commercialization linchpin: Pricing policies Pricing policies of AIFA products are formulated with regard to two main approaches: on-premises and cloud (SaaS). Both approaches are explained in the following subsections. It is notable that both approaches are considered in parallel with a competition-based pricing approach as a supplementary strategy, characterized by market research. 5.7.1 AIFA on-premises pricing approach AIFA on-premises pricing approach is generally associated with the licensing situation in which no reselling permission is granted to the licensee. Technically, in this approach the licensor retains an interest in the property being assigned. This is different from the \u201cassignment\u201d approach which is used in some software agreements to transfer the assignor rights in the property being assigned. AIFA on-promises pricing approach is specified according to a \u201cportion (p)\u201d of the \u201csoftware production total man-hour value (SV)\u201d and is calculated based on annual tariffs of national ICT Guild Organization. This pricing policy is meaningful for customers who try to determine a feasible threshold to choose between insourcing or outsourcing production schemes. The mentioned \u201cportion\u201d is definable based on the number of selling licenses aimed to cover the production costs of a particular software in addition to the intended profit margin. The general template for calculating software production costs in AIFA is explained in the following based on the calculations of Table 2. (1) Product on-promises price = p \u00d7 S V , 0 < p \u2264 1 In Table 2, E(j) is calculatable based on the following equation: (2) E j = A j \u00d7 B j \u00d7 C j \u00d7 D j A(j): Required working weeks for role j B(j): Dedicated number of team members with role j C(j): Average dedicated capacity of role j (%) D(j): Average weekly working hours of role j Moreover, T(j) is the overall hourly wage calculated for employee j based on multiplying three factors (according to tariffs of national ICT Guild Organization). Factors include basic hourly wage (S), specialized profile of human resources ( f 1 (j)), and company profile ( f 2 ). (3) T j = S \u00d7 f 1 j \u00d7 f 2 Basic hourly wage (S) is calculated according to net hourly wage (nw) after applying waste (w), overhead (oh), and profit margin (pm) coefficients. Net hourly wage (nw) is calculated based on annual wage (aw) in terms of national wage directive after subtracting the costs of housing allowance (ha) and groceries allowance (ga), while applying the decremental effects of paid vacation time off ((v) and official holidays (h) on annual working hours (ah). (4) S = n w \u00d7 w \u00d7 o h \u00d7 p m (5) n w = a w \u2212 h a \u2212 g a / a h \u2212 v \u2212 h , w , o h , p m \u2265 100 % Specialized profile of human resources ( f 1 (j)) is calculated by multiplying coefficients of job category ( p 1 ), job rank ( p 2 ), educational degree ( p 3 ), work experience ( p 4 ), and certificate degrees ( p 5 ). (6) f 1 j = p 1 j \u00d7 p 2 j \u00d7 p 3 j \u00d7 p 4 j \u00d7 p 5 j Company profile ( f 2 ) is calculated by multiplying coefficients of company rank ( c 1 ), company field of activity ( c 2 ), and intangible assets ( c 3 ). (7) f 2 = c 1 \u00d7 c 2 \u00d7 c 3 In AIFA on-promises approach, the customer is responsible to provide the infrastructure, server clusters, the network, and other necessary hardware. Other costs might also apply in this approach for database standardization, or installation of extra servers to decrease the processing queue and improve the responding time. Another instance for applying extra costs occurs when extra cameras are required by customer in intelligent attendance system via face recognition. These types of costs are entitled generally as extra hardware installation fees. Maintenance and repair cost of AIFA on-promises approach is free in the first year, and 30% of licensing and setup fee applies for the second year. For proceeding years, the inflation rate is also considered in calculating the maintenance and repair cost. 5.7.2 AIaaS pricing approach SaaS (cloud) pricing approach is the second policy necessary for AIFA products. This approach is required to estimate the price of services per API call. Calculations of this approach are based on two factors: hardware equipment (hw) and software production man-hour value (sw). First, it is necessary to consider the standard response time (rt) to each SaaS request in terms of calling, processing, and responding activities. Then, the breakdown of both hardware and software costs are calculated regarding the standard response time as follows: (8) Product price per API call = h w r t + s w r t Hardware cost of each SaaS response is broken down from the overall hardware cost while considering an average useful life (ul) as follows: (9) h w r t = s p \u00d7 s n \u00d7 c n \u00d7 1 + o h \u00d7 u l \u00d7 i p / u l s \u00d7 s t \u00d7 r t \u2212 1 The variables used in Eq. (9) are explained next: sp: Server price sn: Server numbers in each cluster cn: Total number of clusters ul: Useful life of servers in years, calculatable via Eq. (11) ip: Average inflated price coefficient, calculatable via Eq. (10) ul s : Useful life of servers in seconds, calculatable according to ul rt: API response time in seconds oh: Overhead cost coefficient of server maintenance and network requirements (It is equal to 15% in this case study, based on expert judgment) st: Server busy time coefficient (It is equal to 75% in this case study, based on expert judgment, implying 18 daily hours of full-busy time, or 12 daily hours of full-busy plus 6 daily hours of half-busy time) From the above variables, average inflated price coefficient (ip) is calculatable based on annual inflation rate ((i) according to the following equation: (10) i p = 1 + 1 + i u l / 2 Based on expert judgments, approximate useful life is 5\u20137 (representatively 6) years for 70% of main server parts and 2\u20133 (2.5) years for the remaining 30% consumable parts. Hence, we estimate the hardware useful life as follows: (11) u l = 0 . 70 \u00d7 6 + 0 . 30 \u00d7 2 . 5 = 4 . 95 years Software cost, overhead, and profit margin of each SaaS response is broken down from the overall software production value (SV) while considering an average payback period in seconds ( pp s ) as follows: (12) s w r t = p \u00d7 S V \u00d7 i p / p p s \u00d7 s t \u00d7 r t \u2212 1 , 0 < p \u2264 1 5.8 Discussion The commercialization of AIFA services and systems was a rigorous process requiring accurate planning and implementation. In this regard, two types of professional activities for the commercialization of company\u2019s artificial intelligence systems were put on agenda. These activities are explicated below in terms of created value streams: \u2022 Direct commercialization activities: These activities mainly include testing and reviewing the readiness of products for commercialization, pricing products, managing the product release activities in an API marketplace, establishing pilot services and systems, managing the content creation process with the aid of open innovation, participating in specialized tenders and calls, and monitoring the competitors and potential customers for AI products. \u2022 Important additional measures: These activities chiefly comprise compilation of AI global market analysis report, market research of data labeling systems, designing the requirements for creating national search engine, investigating trends in the use of AI in industries (including mining, oil & gas, construction, and agriculture), compiling the AIFA roadmap document, articulation of a national AI roadmap requirements, the feasibility study of providing intelligent banking services in metaverse, proposing a plan for the development of an intelligent agent, documenting and publishing 4 technological requirements under the title of AI open issues and RFPs through the innovation support funds and other business networks of open innovation ecosystem, compiling the technical requirements of 2 robotic challenges in mechanized warehouses in the form of reverse pitch events, and selection of suppliers for technical requirements. As a result of the discussed activities, a managing dashboard to monitor the overall status of AI products is provided. Results of commercialization-readiness tests, the user interface, API status, and testability by users are the other items reported in this dashboard. The summary of dashboard elements besides main AIFA business model attributes are outlined in Fig. 7. In the future, it is intended to leverage the existing AI products together with the accomplished activities to launch new projects. These projects, which their charters are already published, include the following: \u2022 Intelligent agents for integrated provision of AI services and products \u2022 Customization of an interactive robot to present banking services via AIFA products \u2022 Fraud detection service for banking transactions \u2022 Outsourcing platform of interior and regional AI open projects 6 Conclusion In today\u2019s fast-paced and digitized era, artificial intelligence plays a vital role in increasing the efficiency, performance, and resiliency of businesses. There are few companies that can create AI applications by their development units. Therefore, there should be companies that can provide artificial intelligence services and products in accordance with the needs of businesses. In this paper we presented an AIaaS-based business plan which provides an integrated package of AI products and services for those companies who need AI to develop and improve their performance. A real case study in a company was provided to better reflect our business model as this company is one of the leaders in the field of information technology in Asia. The company\u2019s software products and services are designed with capabilities of new technologies to improve the business performance. We described the roadmap, strategy and the requirement behind our model, the structure of the AI package and its features, as well as the commercialization approach and the measures taken to facilitate the journey of the services to the market with standard methodologies. We described how open innovation approaches were used to improve the performance of AI services and how the new products and services were introduced to the market with an efficient and effective manner. The organization of AIFA AI services and products into three categories as machine vision, natural language processing, and data-driven systems helped better marketing activities and finding right customers. The commercialization package of AIaaS, has its contribution anchored in the integrated promotion of AI products and applications for exterior enterprises in terms of open innovation ecosystem. The strategic approach and systematic roadmap of the real-world case presented here is appliable as a practical tool to pave the way for similar commercialization projects within the field of information and communication technology. It is supposed that the present business model case study is advantageous for those companies and organizations who want to specialize in providing AIaaS or use AI services in their business in an effective manner. The two pricing policies, articulated in the present study in terms of heuristic on-premises and cloud (SaaS) approaches, are introduced as commercialization linchpin. As an implication for contributing to the present research area, it is recommended to investigate the efficiency of these policies in other real-world deployment cases. Simulation models such as Monte Carlo are included among the other validation and verification options in this regard. Moreover, another future research implication takes place in applying quantitative performance evaluation models to prioritize the roadmap, objectives, and action plan entries. Multicriteria decision-making methods are among the available models in this regard.

Artificial Intelligence and Smart Contracts are two cutting-edge technological achievements of the so-called 4th Industrial Revolution era. Both have already had a significant impact on various aspects of modern life, including transactions, and each one has already been under scientific investigation. Instead, their interaction has not become the subject of a debate, although it can further (positively) affect the transactions. This interconnection takes place through specific mechanisms, called Oracles, which can be, among others, highly sophisticated Artificial Intelligence systems (autonomous systems). The present article aims to present the role of the Artificial Intelligence Oracles throughout the \u2018smart contractual procedure\u2019, as well as to shed light on the potential (new) legal issues this interconnection may raise. The main result of this article is to indicate the appropriate legal directions in case of Artificial Intelligence Oracles\u2019 failures, based on the most prevalent current approaches to AI's (the user's) contractual and/or non-contractual liability. The major research's conclusion is that the Artificial Intelligence Oracle's failures may result in one of the following situations: (a) breach of a (smart) contract, (b) unjust enrichment, (c) conclusion of a (voidable) smart contract that should not have been concluded, or (d) non-conclusion of a smart contract that should have been concluded. The responsibility of each person participating in the \u2018smart contractual procedure\u2019, i.e. the contractual parties, the blockchain platform and the Artificial Intelligence user/owner (or even the Artificial Intelligence system itself), as well as the AI provider or designer, is examined in each of the afore-mentioned situations separately. Given that legislative initiatives have already begun, the present article aspires to contribute to the consistent address of the newly raised legal issues. Keywords Artificial intelligence Autonomous systems Smart contracts Blockchain Breach of contract Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction Artificial Intelligence (henceforth AI) 1 1 Henceforth \u201cAI\u201d. and Smart Contracts (henceforth SmC) 2 2 Henceforth \u201cSmC\u201d, used for both singular and plural Smart Contracts. are two cutting-edge technological achievements of the 4th Industrial Revolution era. 3 3 See more about the 4th Industrial Revolution Bra\u00fctigam & Klindt, \u201cIndustrie 4.0, das Internet der Dinge und das Recht\u201d (2015) NHW 1137; European Law Institute (ELI) Principles on Blockchain Technology, Smart Contracts and Consumer Protection (2022) <www.europeanlawinstitute.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/p_eli/Publications/ELI_Principles_on_Blockchain_Technology__Smart_Contracts_and_Consumer_Protection.pdf> accessed 15 Jan 2022 (p. 11). They both have a significant impact on various aspects of modern life, from daily activities (e.g., transportation and entertainment) to the job market, banking, finance, the medical sector, and transactions. A lot has been written in recent decades regarding each of these breakthroughs and their impact from a legal perspective. However, the \u2018cooperation\u2019 of these novel technologies has not become the subject of debate yet, although their interaction has already become apparent. 4 4 See one of the first approaches to both technologies in Taherdoost, \u201cBlockchain Technology and Artificial Intelligence Together: A Critical Review on Applications\u201d (2022) 12 Applied Science 1; Zou, \u201cWhen AI Meets Smart Contracts: The Regulation of Hyper-Autonomous Contracting Systems?\u201d in Contracting and Contract Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (Ebers, Poncibo & Zou (edt.)), (Hurt Publishing, 2022). Indeed, the use of AI applications on blockchain technology, and particularly on SmC, has proven to be a useful tool for bringing into touch the on-chain world, i.e., a SmC running on a blockchain platform, with the off-chain one, i.e. the \u2018real\u2019 world where the contractual outcomes occur. Such an interaction can further benefit transactions, enhancing their velocity, decreasing costs as well as the possibility of contractual non-performance, either by default or without default. Nonetheless, this interconnection poses some legal issues that have never been raised before. For instance, in the event of a malfunction attributed to an AI system that affects the operation of a SmC it is questionable as to whether the user-contractual party on-chain should be held liable and as to what rights they have, in comparison with a party in a \u2018traditional\u2019 contract concluded and executed entirely off-chain, if they can be released from their liability, etc. However, there is no specific legal framework regulating the interaction between AI and SmC, which poses a challenge for legal doctrine. The main points of interest are the fitness of classical legal doctrine and, especially, contract law, to successfully regulate the new transaction reality created by these technologies and the systemization of any new legislative enactment thereon. 5 5 See, inter alia, in the European Union the European Commission's recent Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Laying Down Harmonized Rules on Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act), COM (2021) 206 final; European Commission's Proposal of Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Liability of Defective Products, COM (2022) 495 final; European Commission's Proposal of Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Adapting Non-Contractual Civil Liability Rules to Artificial Intelligence (AI Liability Directive), COM (2022) 496 final. This paper aims to present the interconnection between AI and SmC, shed light on the potential legal issues this interconnection may raise, and suggest certain legal directions to be addressed. The paper consists of four parts: the first two parts seek to introduce the reader to the concept of AI and SmC accordingly, as well as to describe their role at modern transactions (2, 3). Of course, all technical aspects cannot be presented in this article. Apart from being extensively discussed in literature already, they are not necessary for understanding the legal concerns this interaction induces. For this reason, the article puts emphasis only on those technicalities which are significant from a legal point of view. In this framework, the paper also examines the legal treatment of AI, as well as of SmC. As far as AI is concerned, the analysis is restricted to the autonomous AI systems (or autonomous machines) for two reasons: first, because they constitute the most representative type of AI systems nowadays, with an extended usage in almost all sectors of modern life, including transactions; second, because they show great levels of autonomy that cast doubts on the appropriateness of the \u2018traditional\u2019 rules of law about human liability in the event of damage caused by autonomous AI systems. In the paper, the prevalent opinion about AI users\u2019 contractual (and non-contractual) liability is adopted, enhanced with further arguments. Respectively, the paper examines the various types of SmC and their legal nature, which is particularly important to understand in order to formulate the liability issues raised in case of damage caused by the interconnection between SmC and AI. The next part presents the oracles: the mechanisms which facilitate the interconnection between the SmC and the off-chain world (4). Although there are several types of oracles, the paper focuses on the autonomous AI oracles since they are the oracles that can enable an autonomous interaction with the SmC, revolutionizing the way people carry out transactions. In the fourth part, the various types of AI oracle failures, as well as their impact on SmC, are analyzed (5). This impact may vary depending on the underlying kind of SmC and can raise, inter allia, one of the following situations: (a) breach of a (smart) contract, (b) unjust enrichment, (c) conclusion of a (voidable) SmC that should not have been concluded, or (d) non-conclusion of a SmC that should have been concluded. Further, the analysis shows that all the persons taking part in the \u2018smart contractual procedure\u2019, i.e., the contractual parties, the blockchain platform, the AI user/owner, as well as the AI provider or designer, may be held liable based on different liability regimes (i.e. contractual, non-contractual liability regimes) in each of the afore-mentioned situations. In the last part the main conclusions regarding the interconnection of the two novel technologies from a legal point of view are presented (6). 2 The role of artificial intelligence in modern transactions: applications, limitations and legal treatment 2.1 Applications of AI and inherent limitations Over the past decades, AI has become a scientific field of primary importance on a global scale. 6 6 Although the term \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 is widely accepted, the scientific community does not fully agree about its specific content, see Rissland, \u201cArtificial Intelligence and Law: Stepping Stones to a Model of Legal Reasoning\u201d (1990) Yale L Rev 1957; Ertel, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (2nd edn., Springer 2017); UNESCO, Preliminary Study on the Ethics of AI (2019) <https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367823> accessed 20 Dec 2022 (pp. 7-9); M\u00fcller, \"Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2021) Zalta (ed.), <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2021/entries/ethics-ai/> accessed 20 Dec 2022.

Nonetheless, machine learning renders their function opaque, which although exceptional, is inexplicable for humans, even for their designers. This constitutes the so-called black box effect or black box problem, from which all autonomous systems suffer. 20 20 Wulf & Seizov, \u201cArtificial Intelligence and Transparency: A Blueprint for Improving the Regulation of AI Applications in the EU\u201d (2020) 31 Eur Bus L Rev 611 (p. 619); Papadouli, \u201cTransparency in Artificial Intelligence: A Legal Perspective\u201d (2022) 4 J of Ethics and Legal Tech 25.

Further, it sparks a hot debate in the literature about the appropriate legal treatment of autonomous AI systems, as analyzed immediately below. 2.2 Legal treatment Despite the extensive use of autonomous machines in transactions, there is no consensus in literature with regard to their legal treatment in the case of contractual 23 23 See an overview of various supported opinions at Solum, \u201cLegal Personhood for AI\u201d (1992) 70 North Carolina L Rev 1231; Karnow (1996); Allen & Widdison (1996); Fisher, \u201cComputer as Agents: A proposed Approach to Revised U.C.C.

(as well as in the case of non-contractual) liability. According to the most prevalent opinion, 24 24 Allen & Widdison (1996), p. 43 ff.; Mehrings (1998), p. 31; Brozek & Jakubiec, \u201cOn the Legal Responsibility of Autonomous Machines\u201d (2017) 25 Artificial Intelligence L 293 (pp. 293 and 303). the law as it now stands should consider autonomous machines as mere communication tools, like any other software system (e.g., email) or electronic devices (e.g., telephones and fax machines), or like a messenger (nuntius), 25 25 Wettig and Zehendner (2004), p. 125; Ke\u00dfler (2017), p. 592. whose role is merely to convey the declaration of intention (offer or acceptance) of its user-principal to the other contractual party, and/or like an agent, who performs the contractual obligations on behalf of the principal. Although AI systems show greater levels of autonomy, this approach adopts a legal fiction that anything issued by an autonomous AI system is actually issued by its user, 26 26 Allen & Widdison (1996), p. 46.

Highlighting the trait of autonomy, other opinions suggest that autonomous machines should be legally treated as representatives under the mutatis mutandis application of the law of disclosed agency; 28 28 Fisher (1997), p. 545; Chopra and White (2009), pp. 369-370 and 384.

Contra Lerouge (2000), p. 411. whose liability in the case of damage is limited accordingly. The basic advantage of these approaches is that they take into account that AI systems act autonomously. 35 35 Pagallo (2013), p. 58. Nevertheless, they fail, in fact, to provide practical solutions, while they \u201cexceed\u201d the current legal framework: the current rules of private law have not (yet) attributed legal personhood to the autonomous AI systems, 36 36 See also the recent proposal of the European Financial and Social Commission Com (2020) 65 final, which strongly recommends no legal personhood should be attributed to AI. while it cannot be held that they could have contractual capacity, even a restricted one, without legal capacity. Besides, in practice, no registry about AI systems has been established yet, 37 37 It is noteworthy that according to Art. 60 of Proposal of European Commission for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding harmonized rules on AI (\u2018AI Act\u2019 COM (2021) 206 final), a database for stand-alone high-risk AI systems is yet to be established. while the existence of a \u201clegal representative\u201d who bears no property does not facilitate in any way the third party-claimants. Therefore, the prevalent opinion, according to which the autonomous machines should be treated as communication tools and any contractual liability arising from their use should be attributable directly to their users, seems to be the most consistent one within the current legal framework. Further, this approach boosts the transaction security, since it clarifies the person who should be responsible in the case of non-performance: the AI user. It also provides the latter with a strong incentive to ensure that their \u201cemployed\u201d autonomous machine operates properly. Indeed, had the AI user not been considered legally bound regarding the contract concluded by their \u201cemployed\u201d autonomous machine, they would not have been cautious enough about their AI system's proper function. 38 38 See also regarding liability of autonomous vehicles Di, Cehn & Talley, \u201cLiability for Autonomous Vehicles and Human-Driven Vehicles: A Hierarchical Game-Theoretic Approach\u201d Transportation Research Part C\u201d (2020) 118 Emerging Technologies 1. Moreover, any AI user could rely on the system's alleged malfunction or opaque function (the aforementioned AI black box problem or black box effect) to avoid their engagement in the contract; as a result, the other contractual party would bear the risk of the AI system's (mal)function, without having any power over it and, most of the time, without even knowing that they transact with an autonomous machine and not with a human. This is a typical situation of information asymmetry between the contractual parties of a contract, where one of them has an incentive to increase their exposure to risk because their contractual partner will bear the cost in the case of loss (moral hazard). 39 39 Firstly, the concept of moral hazard appeared in assurances (see also Abraham & Rabin, \u201cAutomated Vehicles and Manufacturer Responsibility for Accidents: A New Legal Regime for a New Era\u201d 105 (2019) Virginia L Rev 127 (p. 134), but today one can encounter it in many other fields as well (see Dembe and Boden, \u201cMoral Hazzard: A Question of Morality?\u201d (2000) 10 New Solutions 257; Bannier, Vertragstheorie. Eine Einf\u00fchrung mit finanz\u00f6konomischen Beispielen und Anwendungen (Physica-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2005) (pp. 69-71)). In the case of autonomous machines, the problem of information asymmetry is exacerbated due to the black box effect. The prevalent opinion \"protects\" the counter contractual party from this risk, providing at the same time a certain element of justice: since the AI user is the one who opts to employ an autonomous machine and to involve it in trading, the assumption that they should bear the cost of any (mal)function of it sounds logical. 40 40 Allen & Widdison (1996), p. 46. See also Cornelius (2002), p. 355; Shavell, \u201cOn the Redesign of Accident Liability for the World of Autonomous Vehicles\u201d 49 J of L Studies 214. Given that in common law systems the contractual liability is non-fault based, while in the civil law ones the relevant fault is being presumed, this approach is also quite aligned with the prevalent opinion about the AI user's non-contractual liability, which endorses that the negligence-based liability regime, like the tort liability, should be put aside, and a strict liability regime be adopted. 41 41 Especially as far as car accidents and defected products are concerned, see Bertolini, \u201cRobots as Products: The Case for a Realistic Analysis of Robotic Applications and Liability Rules\u201d 5 (2013) L of Innovations and Economics 214; Abraham & Rabin (2019); De Chiara, Elizanlde, Manna & Segura-Moreiras, \u201cCar accidents in the age of robots\u201d 68 (2021) Inter Rev of L and Economics 1; see also the concerns of Shavell (2019), arguing about a new type of \u201cstrict liability with damages paid to the state\u201d, as well as the new liability regime \u201cwhich blends negligence-based rules and strict manufacturer liability rules\u201d, by Guerra, Parisi & Pi, \u201cLiability for robots II: legal challenges\u201d (2022) 18 J of Institutional Economics 553 (passim.).

The above analysis is crucial for handling damages raised in the case of SmC, when they cannot be self-concluded, self-performed and/or self-executed due to an AI oracle's failure, as it is analyzed thoroughly below. 3 The role of smart contracts in modern transactions: applications, limitations and legal treatment 3.1 SmC applications and inherent limitations Smart Contracts were first introduced in legal doctrine in the mid-1990s by Nick Szabo, a legal scholar and technologist, in a series of papers, 45 45 According to Szabo\u2019s \u2018definition\u2019, smart contracts are \u201ca set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises. The protocols are usually implemented with programs on a computer network, or in other forms of digital electronics\u201d.

According to Szabo, SmC are the technological evolution of classic vending machines 46 46 Their first appearance is placed in antiquity, described by the ancient Greek engineer and mathematician Hero Ctesibius (also referred to as Heron) and his work Pneumatika in 62 AD, where he refers to the function of a machine that dispensed holy water in Egyptian temples, when the practitioner inserted a coin, see Hero of Alexandria, The Pneumatics, section 21 translated from Greek and edited by Woodcroft <https://web.archive.org/web/20101208040820/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/hero/index.html> accessed 30 Dec 2022.

Szasbo's revolutionary concept did not become a reality until over 10 years later. Although some progress had been made in this direction, 47 47 Indeed, insurance companies offer passengers the possibility to purchase flight insurance from a \u2018vending machine\u2019 stationed in airports, usually at flight gates. To do this, the customer inputs their personal data and flight information on the machine's screen and makes payment, by inserting coins in the slot or using another form of payment. When the predefined conditions are met (provision of personal data, flight data, and payment), the machine issues an insurance policy and retains a duplicate for the company's records; see Cannarsa, \u201cInterpretation of Contracts and Smart Contracts: Smart Interpretation or Interpretation of Smart Contracts?\u201d (2018) 26 Eur Rev of Private L 773 (p. 784); Rohr, \u201cSmart Contracts and Traditional Contract Law, Or: The Law of the Vending Machine\u201d (2019) 67 Cleveland State L Rev 71 (p. 82).

However, the sectors where they have had the most valuable use up to now are the private insurance industry and crowdfunding projects. 71 71 See more detailed information about crowdfunding de Quesada, \u201cCrowdfunding in Europe\u201d in Grundmann (ed.) European Contract Law in the Digital Age (Springer, 2018) (p. 101 ff.). In these cases, a SmC usually facilitates the verification of certain events and the allocation of funds to claimers/beneficiaries in a direct and quick way: an insurance company creates a policy in the form of a SmC, which applies when specific conditions are met, e.g. when a natural disaster occurs (like a hurricane, earthquake or drought); once the relative data (e.g. wind speed, location, magnitude of earthquake) are inserted into the system, the compensation can automatically be released to the claimers. 72 72 Savelyev (2016), p. 122; Levi & Lipton, \u201cAn Introduction to Smart Contracts and their Potential and Inherent Limitations\u201d (2018) Harvard L School Forum for Corporate Governance <https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/05/26/an-introduction-to-smart-contracts-and-their-potential-and-inherent-limitations/> accessed 27 Dec 2022; Temte (2019), p. 101. 73 73 Similarly, SmC can be used to determine more efficiently insurance premiums: the higher the possibility of a person having an accident when driving a vehicle, the higher the insurance fee would cost, see Durovic & Jansen, \u201cFormation of Smart Contracts under Contract Law\u201d in DiMatteo, Cannarsa & Poncibo (ed.) Cambridge Handbook of Smart Contracts, Blockchain Technology and Digital Platforms (Cambridge U Press, 2020) (pp. 64-65). Accordingly, as an example, in a crowdfunding project, 74 74 Savelyev (2016), p. 122. once the amount exceeds the necessary total, it is automatically transferred to the beneficiary. 75 75 Accordingly, smart contracts can be used in the entertainment industry to fund the creation of new movies or TV series directly by the public, see Lingwall & Mogallapu (2019), p. 310. See also for further uses in the entertainment sector Temte (2019), p. 90. Apart from these two last cases, SmC can have an extended use in other transactions, facilitating contract performance and execution. 76 76 M\u00fcller & Seiler, \u201eSmart Contracts auf der Sicht des Vertragsrechts\u201c (2019) 3 AJP/PJA 317 (p. 320). For instance, in the stock market they can be used for stock purchase and stock sales, when prices reach a certain level. 77 77 Temte (2019), p. 100. Moreover, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), SmC are expected to gain even more importance, allocating obligations, duties and rights to connected devices. 78 78 \u0397eckmann & Schmidt (2017), p. 8; Stazi (2021), p. 82. Their role should not necessarily be limited only to quite rudimentary transactions, such as cryptocurrency transfer from A's wallet to B's when specific conditions occur, 79 79 Levi & Lipton (2018). or imposing penalties when the set conditions are not met. Since an economic asset (movable, immovable or data/information) can be digitally represented and controlled by digital means, 80 80 Szabo (1997); Durovic & Janssen, \u201cThe formation of Blockchain-based Contracts in the Light of Contract Law\u201d (2019) Eur Rev of Private L 753 (p. 757). it can be the subject of a SmC. 81 81 Savelyev (2016), p. 119; Woebbeking, \u201cThe Impact of Smart Contracts on Traditional Concepts of Contract Law\u201d (2019) 10 J of Intellectual Property, Info Tech and Electronic Comm L 105 (p. 107); Lingwall & Mogalappu (2019), pp. 287-288. See also Levi & Lipton (2018), highlighting that the scientific community is distanced from this because of the difficulty in \u201ctranslating\u201d legal criteria to computer code. Instead when contract performance requires effort or expertise, as in service contracts (e.g., in teaching and caring), 82 82 Savelyev (2016), p. 123; Jiang (2018), p. 143. the contractual object cannot be digitally represented and, thus, it cannot be supported by a SmC. Similarly, transactions which entail non-operational clauses, such as legal concepts of \u2018good faith\u2019, \u2018undertake best endeavors in\u2019, or \u2018reasonable standard\u2019, which demand qualitative judgment, cannot be part of a SmC. 83 83 Syllaba, \u201cInternet Smart Contracts: Are They Really Smart?\u201d (2020) 19 Common L Rev 19 (p. 20). Contra Raskin (2017), p. 314. See also Blemus, \u201cLaw and Blockchain: A Legal Perspective on current regulatory trends worldwide\u201d (2017) 4 Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Financier (Corporate Finance and Capital Markets L Rev) RTDF 14. Further, SmC are inflexible, 84 84 Hsiao (2017), pp. 691-692; Cannarsa (2019), pp. 780-781; Temte (2019), p. 98-99. i.e., unmodifiable in case the circumstances or the legal landscape change: once put in motion, they are executed according to their predefined smart code, and no one can inhibit or influence the expected and fully foreseeable transactional outcome. This rigid 85 85 Temte (2019), p. 98. character may sometimes contradict good faith and business practices or even legislation that demands more flexibility in transactions. For instance, in the event of an unexpected strike or bad weather conditions that affect transportation, any delay in product delivery or money deposit may be justifiable; or in case the legislation changes (e.g., high interest rates), the amount of money that must be deposited may vary. However, the SmC will be executed anyway, according to its predefined instructions, although contractual parties may act differently off-chain, e.g., accepting delayed performance, 86 86 Levi & Lipton (2018). Cf. Low & Mik, \u201cPause the Blockchain Legal Revolution\u201d (2020) 69 Inter and Comparative L Quarterly 135. or a partial one. This constitutes another inherent limitation of SmC which can be overcome only if they have direct interaction with the off-chain world. Such an interaction can be realized through specific mechanisms, called oracles. Should they be AI systems, particularly autonomous ones, the potential of SmC will be unleashed, given the endless capabilities these AI systems have, 87 87 Rohr (2019), p. 7. as analyzed thoroughly below (see under 4). 3.2 Legal treatment The legal nature of SmC has been the subject of an extended debate. 88 88 See an overview at Dimitrieva & Scmidt-Kessen (2019), 69. On the one hand, a great part of legal scholars claims that SmC do not constitute any legal contract, but rather they are mere computer protocols that execute an already concluded contract. On the other hand, others accept their legally binding character, claiming that they are able even to fully replace traditional legal contracts. In fact, both approaches seem to be incomplete, insofar as they highlight only some of SmC's features (the technical or the legal ones, respectively) belittling others (the legal or the technical ones, respectively). Thus, they only partially capture their dynamic concept, which in fact can have different forms in transactions. Indeed, a SmC can appear in transactions in one of the following forms: 89 89 See also de Filippi & Wright (2018), p. 74 ff. Cf. Werbach, \u201cTrust but Verify: Why The Blockchain Needs the Law\u201d (2018) 33 Berkeley Tech L 439 (p. 535); de Graaf, \u201cFrom Old to New: From Internet to Smart Contracts and from People to Smart Contracts\u201d (2019) 35 Computer L & Security Rev 1. (a) as a tool for self-performance and self-execution of an already concluded contract; (b) as a specific part of a contract (hybrid contract), 90 90 Idem. (2018), p. 76 ff. with a typical example the Ricardian contracts; 91 91 Grigg, \u201cRicardian Contracts\u201d (1995) <https://iang.org/papers/ricardian_contract.html> accessed 29 Jan 2023. and (c) as a stand-alone SmC. More specifically for each of these types: (a) The first type of SmC is the most common one in practice so far. With this type, the contractual parties have already communicated in the real (off-chain) world, 92 92 i.e., located and run outside the blockchain platform. negotiated the contractual terms, and concluded the contract entirely off-chain, orally or in prose, if required. After having concluded and formed the contract, they choose to encode (part of) the contractual content in the blockchain platform 93 93 De Graaf (2019), p. 10. to take advantage of the benefits this technology entails, i.e. the automatic contract's self-performance and self-execution. 94 94 Raskin (2017), p. 309; van Adrichem, \u201cEnforceability of Smart Contracts under the Statute of Frauds\u201d 2018 Science & Tech L Rev 1; Bilski, Blockchain-Technologie, \u201cSmart Contracts und selbstvollziehende Vertrage\u201d, Gutachten Universit\u00e4t Leipzig (2019) < https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3425805> accessed 4 Jul 2023 (p. 53); Lingwall and Mogallapu (2019), p. 298; Woebbeking (2021), p. 108. To that end, the contract must be expressed in a programming language, namely be \u2018translated\u2019 from a natural language to a computer programming one 95 95 Dimitrieva & Schmidt-Kessen (2019), p. 71, 75. (e.g. to Solidity or to another computer language based on Boolean logic), and, subsequently, be embedded in the blockchain platform (smart code). The contractual content translated and embedded into the blockchain platform constitutes the so-called contractware. 96 96 Contractware is called the procedure of \u2018translation\u2019 and implementation of the contractual terms in the blockchain platform, see Raskin (2017), p. 307, 312. The contractware is not a contract from a legal point of view; 97 97 See also Meyer (2020), p. 19 arguing that smart contracts are \u2018apps\u2019 that both reflect the parties\u2019 agreement, like the contract document, and initiate its performance. For these reasons, smart contracts cannot be held void or be terminated, unlike legal contracts; Cuccuru, \u201cBeyond Bitcoin: an early overview on smart contracts\u201d (2017) 25 Inter J of L and Info Tech 179. it is rather a computer program that serves as a technical tool for facilitating the automatic self-performance and self-execution of an already off-chain concluded and formed contract. 98 98 See also Principle 2 par. A (2) of the ELI Principles on Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. For this reason, the contractware does not have any legal binding character, i.e. it does not pose itself any legal obligations to the contractual parties. Instead, it is the off-chain contract that poses them and deals with all the pertinent legal issues. 99 99 Jiang (2018), p. 140-141. (b) In the second type of SmC, the hybrid contract, the contractual parties have also communicated in the real off-chain world and negotiated the contractual terms. But they have decided to form the contract partially off-chain and partially on-chain, i.e., a part of the contract is formed in the real world in a natural language, orally or in prose, while the rest part of the contract is directly embedded in the smart code. 100 100 See also Principle 2 par. A (4) of the ELI Principles on Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. These two parts complement one another 101 101 Lingawall & Mogallapu (2019), p. 299. and altogether constitute the one and only contractual content. A typical representative of a hybrid contract would be the Rircardian Contracts. 102 102 Grigg, \u201cRicardian Contracts\u201d (1996), according to whom a Ricardian contract constitutes \u201ca single document that is a) a contract offered by an issuer to holders, b) for a valuable right held by holders, and managed by the issuer, c) easily readable by people (like a contract on paper), d) readable by programs (parsable like a database), e) digitally signed, f) carries the keys and server information, and g) allied with a unique and secure identifier\u201d. Their main feature is that they are readable by a human and a computer program at the same time, as they are written in both a natural and a computer language. 103 103 Chohan, \u201cWhat is a Ricardian Contract?, Discussion Paper Series: Notes on the 21st Century\u201d, (2017) <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3085682> accessed 17 May 2023; de Graaf (2019), p. 10. See also Werbach (2018), p. 544. From a practical point of view, a Ricardian contract is a digital document that, after applying special software, automatically converts the natural language, in which it is written by the parties, into a computer language; any change made to the contractual text in natural language is automatically \"reflected\" in the computer code. The hybrid SmC serves not only as a means for the contract's self-performance and self-execution, like the previous type, but also as a means for the contract's formation, while its conclusion is conducted entirely off-chain. (c) The third type of SmC, the stand-alone one, exists entirely on-chain. 104 104 i.e. located and run exclusively inside the blockchain platform. , 105 105 Savelyev (2017), p. 124; Jaccard, \u201cSmart Contracts and the Law\u201d (2017) 23 Jusletter IT 1 (p. 22); van Adrichem (2018); Lingwall & Mogallapu (2019), p. 298-299 (\u201ccode-only contract\u201d), Dimitrieva & Schmidt-Kessen (2019), p. 71. This type is the most uncommon so far, but in fact it constitutes the most revolutionary type of SmC since it can alter for good the way people are used to transacting. The parties usually select this type either because they cannot, or it is difficult to, have any communication in the real off-chain world (e.g. because they live in different countries), or because they do not want to have any. This way they are able to capture their entire contractual agreement in the blockchain platform, from its beginning until its execution. Indeed, contrary to the previous types of SmC, the stand-alone SmC is concluded entirely on-chain through the blockchain platform with the use of the smart contract code as the contractual language. 106 106 Lingawall & Mogallapu (2019), p.299. Usually there are no prior negotiations between the contractual parties in the real off-chain world, 107 107 Tjong Tjin Tai (2018), p. 804. neither any legal document entailing the parties\u2019 declarations of intention. Therefore, in the stand-alone SmC the contractual parties use the smart code not only to automatically perform their legal obligations, but also to form their declarations of intention and communicate them with each other via the blockchain platform; 108 108 See also Principle 2 par. A (3) of the ELI Principles on Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. i.e. the blockchain serves not only as a tool for the contract's self-performance, self-execution, and formation, but also as a means for the contract's conclusion, 109 109 See also Lingwall & Mogallapu (2019), p. 299. facilitating the exchange of the parties\u2019 declarations of intention and the meeting of their minds. As a result, given that the contractual elements of a contract exist, i.e. the parties\u2019 declarations of intentions (offer and acceptance), the meeting of their minds (on certain definite contractual terms), their intentions to create legal relations as well as the consideration in the common law jurisdictions, or, respectively, a valid causa in the civil law ones, the stand-alone SmC constitutes a legal contract under the \u2018traditional\u2019 rules of contract law. 110 110 See also Giancaspro, \u201cIs a \u2018Smart Contract\u2019 Really a Smart Idea? Insights from a Legal Perspective\u201d (2017) 33 Computer L & Security Rev 825; Papantoniou, \u201cSmart Contracts in the New Era of Contract Law\u201d (2020) 4 Digital L J 8. Therefore, it is the one which poses the legal obligations to the parties and is subject to (all) rules of law about contracts (e.g. invalidity). 111 111 Dimitrieva & Schmidt-Kessen (2019), p. 76, 83 ff. Its legally binding character is also supported by the principle of the freedom of contract 112 112 Durovic and Janssen (2019), p. 764; Bilski (2019), p. 53. and the principle of informality of contracts as well. 113 113 Jaccard (2017), p. 22. According to the first one, everyone is free to decide whether to enter a contract, to select the face of their contractual party, and to form the contractual content, under the condition that the law and the morality (bonos mores) are not violated, while according to the second one, no formality is required for the conclusion of a contract, unless otherwise it is provided by law. Specific manifestation thereof is the freedom of the contractual parties to choose the contractual language in which they want to form the contractual content; this language can be a spoken one (e.g., English, German, French, etc.) or a written one (e.g., Latin or Ancient Greek). Accordingly, manifestation of the private autonomy should be: first, the selection of a (high-level) programming language like Solidity (used by the public blockchain platform Ethereum) 114 114 Bilski (2019), p. 54. See also Principle 8 of the ELI Principles on Blockchain Technology and Smart Contract. Cf. Savelyev 123. as the contractual language, as far as there are no special provisions-restrictions regarding the comprehensibility of the language by the contractual parties; 115 115 Such a restriction is provided, for instance, in the case of business to consumer relationships where the contractual language should be deemed natural, plain and intelligible by the consumers, otherwise the contract is considered not concluded (Directive 93/13 Art. 5), see Bilski (2019), p. 54, 72. second, the use of the blockchain platform by the contractual parties, as an electronic channel to communicate their declarations of intention to each other (like a fax or an email). Each of these types of SmC may interconnect with AI systems through specific mechanisms called oracles, as they are analyzed immediately below. 4 Oracles 4.1 Introduction An 116 116 Cohn, West & Parker, \u201cSmart After All: Blockchain, Smart Contracts, Parametric Insurances, and Smart Energy Grids\u201d (2017) Georgetown L Tech Rev 273 (p. 283); de Filippi & Wright (2018), p. 75; Temte (2019), p. 96; Tjong Tjin Tai (2018), p. 791; M\u00fcller & Seiler (2019), p. 322; McDonald, \u201cSmart Contracts\u201d (2021) Columbia Bus L Rev; Beniiche, \u201cA Study of Blockchain Oracles\u201d (2020) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07140.pdf> accessed 5 Jan 2023; Durovic & Jansen, (2020), p. 66; Meyer (2020), p. 18; de Caria (2020), p. 29; Kipker et al. (2020), p. 509. Oracle is any mechanism that extracts data, information or expert knowledge from external sources and provides them to a \u2018closed\u2019 system, i.e. a system that has no access to these sources on its own; or vice versa, any mechanism that conveys data from a closed system to the external \u2018world\u2019. 117 117 Temte (2019), p. 96; Poblet et al. (2020), p. 2; Greenspan (2016). Cf. Stazi (2021), p. 81. In the case of SmC, oracles serve as a communication channel linking the physical (off-chain) world to blockchain infrastructure (on-chain), thus, mitigating the rigid character of SmC and allowing them to become more flexible and dynamic. Oracles can provide a blockchain platform with any information about outcomes of events (such as elections or sports), financial data (such as exchange rates or stock prices), or supply chain information (such as temperature, location, and delivery), and vice versa. For instance, in the case of private insurance provided through SmC, according to which compensation must be given to beneficiaries (e.g. farmers) when bad weather conditions occur (such as a hurricane or extended drought), an oracle can provide the blockchain platform with information about the speed of the wind or the total amount of water. 118 118 Cohn et al. (2017), p. 293 ff. See also the paradigm of AXA and Etherisc, insurance companies which offer compensation to travelers experiencing delays or airline cancellations. Once the information about a flight delay or cancelation is acquired, it is automatically provided to the blockchain and compensation is automatically paid to the claimers, see Kipker et al. (2020), p. 510; Stazi (2021), p. 81, footn. 62. Furthermore, in the case of a \u2018smart lock\u2019, when the predefined fee is received, the oracle can transmit the information off-chain, so that the door can automatically open. There are a lot of types of oracles. One of the most prevalent ones is software oracles. 119 119 Also known as deterministic oracles, see Beniiche (2020) p. 5. These oracles can interact with any sources of information available online, such as databases, servers, and websites, and convey data to the blockchain platform in real time. For instance, a software oracle can transmit information regarding stock prices to the blockchain platform, so that the SmC can buy or sell them. On the other hand, there are also hardware oracles. 120 120 Beniiche (2020), p. 2; Poblet et al. (2020), p. 5. These ones interact with the physical world and convey the necessary information to the blockchain platform, or vice versa. A hardware oracle is usually installed in physical objects with electronic sensors, like robots, or relates to objects with QR codes/barcodes. Upon receiving the necessary information, a hardware oracle \u2018transforms\u2019 it to digital value that can be \u2018understood\u2019 by SmC and releases it to the blockchain platform. For instance, upon receiving the information that a transporting product has arrived at a loading day, a hardware oracle relays the information to the blockchain platform which then executes decisions based on this information. These oracles have great usage in the supply chain sector. Both software and hardware oracles can convey information from external sources to the SmC, and vice versa. The ones that transmit data/information/knowledge from external sources to the blockchain platform are called inbound oracles, while the ones which send them from the blockchain platform to the physical world are called outbound oracles. An example of an inbound oracle is one that informs the blockchain platform about the external temperature; this oracle can be either software (receiving the relevant information from the web), or hardware (receiving it by use of sensors). On the other hand, an example of an outbound oracle is a smart lock: when the necessary funds are deposited to a specified account, the oracle then transmits the information to the physical world and allows a mechanism to unlock the smart lock; or, vice versa, should the agreed funds not be deposited on time, the outbound oracle conveys the information to the physical world and activates the mechanism for inhibiting or interrupting, for example, a vehicle's function. Further, there are also oracles which can be used not only for transmitting information from the off-chain world to the on-chain one or vice versa (also known as data carried or automated oracles), 121 121 Beniiche (2020), p. 2. but ones that can perform computation off-chain and subsequently transmit the outcome on-chain (computation oracles). 122 122 Id.. For example, a computation oracle can perform a computationally intensive regression calculation off-chain and release this information to the blockchain technology; or assess the creditworthiness of a loan-applicant and release the information to the blockchain platform. These oracles are quite useful because SmC demand high computational power to be executed and their costs are high. Since oracles can directly affect SmC operation, only a trusted third party (known as TTP or TP) should be an oracle. 123 123 Id.; Durovic & Jansen (2020), p. 66; Stazi (2021), p. 81. Such third trusted parties can be humans or legal entities or other systems. 124 124 Such systems include Oraclize or Provable Things, see Beniiche (2020), p. 2. For instance, an oracle can be a courier or an agent 125 125 Cieplak & Leefatt (2017), p. 424; Tjong Tjin Tai (2018), p. 791. who certifies to their tablet that a product has been delivered; 126 126 Meyer (2020), p. 18. or a bank which certifies the conformity of products prior to releasing any amount of money to the beneficiary in the case of a letter of credit; or a system installed in a car, which can send signals to the police, when the car is involved in a car accident. 127 127 Cf. Tjong Tjin Tai (2018), p. 791. Such a system can use AI, i.e. it can be an autonomous AI system. In this case the oracle does not only serve as a \u2018bridge\u2019 between the on-chain and the off-chain world, 128 128 Its ancestor is deemed the Turing o-machine, see Turing, Systems of Logics Based on Ordinals (Phd thesis, Princeton U 1938). See more about Turing's o-machines Soare, \u201cOracle Turing Machines, Online Computing, and three Displacements in Computability Theory\u201d (2009) 160 Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 370; Poblet et al. (2020), p. 3. but also as a medium for bringing into contact two novel technologies, AI and blockchain, thus, maximizing their potentials. 4.2 AI oracles\u2019 applications on SmC and inherent limitations AI oracles can have a lot of uses throughout the SmC procedure, from its formation and conclusion to its modification. First, as already implied, AI oracles can be used for triggering (smart) contractual conditions in the form of \u201cif X occurs, then Y is executed\u201d. 129 129 Poblet et al. (2020), p. 4. All the above-described paradigms, e.g., information about temperature and weather conditions, money deposits, prices\u2019 height, inflation, and exchange rates, are of this type. But apart from this (expected) use, AI oracles can have more sophisticated applications, 130 130 See also Sartor (2018), p. 269. such as at the formation of (smart) contractual content. 131 131 Herian, \u201cSmart Contracts: A Remedial Analysis\u201d (2021) 30 Info and Communications Tech L 17 (p. 28). Production of speech constitutes a common subject matter of AI, 132 132 Searle, The Construction of Social Reality (Free Press, 1995) (p. 208); Sartor (2018), p. 265. particularly of autonomous AI systems. When contractual parties have already entered negotiations off-chain, AI oracles can facilitate the formation of SmC by \u2018translating\u2019 natural language to a computer language (e.g. Solidity,), and vice versa. 133 133 See O'Shields, \u201cSmart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain\u201d (2017) 21 North Carolina Banking Institute 177 (p. 189); Clack, \u201cSmart Contract Templates: Legal Semantics and Code Validation\u201d (2018) 2 J of Digital Banking 338. Of course, this can take place so far only for simple orders, not for sophisticated ones, like those including abstract legal notions (e.g. good faith) or demanding cognitive judgment (e.g. reasonable efforts). Nonetheless, AI systems are showing significant progress in the fields of legal ontology and legal interpretation, 134 134 Idelberger (2018), pp. 221-222. Contra Mik, \u201cSmart Contracts: Terminology, Technical Limitations and Real World Complexity\u201d (2017) 9 L, Innovation and Tech 269; Hasting (2020), p. 375; Syllaba (2020), p. 21. thus, more legally sophisticated AI applications are expected to develop soon. Further, AI oracles can be used for controlling proper contract performance, identifying the cause of non-performance and whether it is attributable to the debtor. 135 135 Tjong Tjin Tai (2018), p. 798. For instance, should a product not be delivered on time, an AI oracle can examine the reason for the delay and identify if it is attributable to the debtor's default or to force majeure (e.g. bad weather conditions or a pandemic that results in disruption and delays), releasing the information to the blockchain platform; in the first case, the information will trigger the predefined penalties (already implemented in smart code) against the debtor, while in the second case the system will refrain from it. Determining the cause of non-performance demands sometimes sophisticated legal analysis, but since scientific research shows significant progress in this field, 136 136 See Surden, \u201cComputable Contracts\u201d (2012) 46 U of California-Davis L Rev 629; Spyropoulos, Kornilakis, Makris, Bratsas, Tsiantos & Antoniou, \u201cSemantic Representation of the Intersection of Crime Law and Civil Tort (2022) 7 Data 176; also Tjong Tjin Tai, Formalizing Contract Law for Smart Contracts, Tilburg Private L Working Paper 2017 < http://www.ssrn.com/link/Tilburg-Private-Law.html> accessed 30 Jan 2023. AI oracles are expected to soon be able to perform well at legal reasoning and argumentation. 137 137 See Idelberger (2018), p. 222. Contra Tjong Tjin Tai (2019), pp. 799-800. Accordingly, an AI oracle can mitigate the rigid character of SmC, allowing them to be modified 138 138 See also potentials of undoing/modifying SmC from a technical perspective at Marino & Juels, \u201cSetting Standards for Altering and Undoing Smart Contracts\u201d (2016) Lecture Notes in Computer Science <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304480352_Setting_Standards_for_Altering_and_Undoing_Smart_Contracts> accessed 30 Dec 202; Temte (2019), 99; Chen, Xia, Lo & Grundy, \u201cWhy Do Smart Contracts Self-Destruct? Investigating the Self-destruct Function on Ethereum\u201d (2021) 31 ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology 1; Herian, (2021), pp. 30-31. when needed. For instance, in the event of an unpredictable change of circumstances or force majeure that demands SmC be modified, the AI oracle can release the information to the blockchain platform, thus, enabling SmC modification prior to being executed. 139 139 Stazi (2021), pp. 134, 137-138. See also about \u2018adaptive systems\u2019 Sartor (2018), p. 269. Moreover, AI oracles can facilitate the procedure of the undoing of SmC. For instance, in the case of an already executed transaction through SmC that needs to be voided, AI oracles can provide the blockchain platform with information about the judicial process's outcome, in order the transaction to be reserved on-chain. Similarly, AI dispute resolution mechanisms, which are able to apply their existing encoded legal rules, 140 140 Temte (2019), p. 105. can be installed in SmC, providing judgment when a dispute arises. 141 141 Cf. Tjong Tjin Tai (2019), p. 791. However, the role of AI oracles is going to become even more constructive, should they be used at the stage of the conclusion of the SmC. For instance, AI oracles could be used for identifying the age of contractual parties using biometric data 142 142 See about restrictions of the recent European Commission Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Laying Down Harmonized Rules on Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act), COM (2021) 206 final, Art. 5. prior to the conclusion of the SmC; or, similarly, for checking the contractual content for any illegality or immorality, especially the standard unfair contract terms which are typical in transactions (e.g., typical terms in consumer contracts, according to EU Directive 93/13/EEC). 143 143 Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 2013 on unfair terms in consumer contracts OJ L095 21.04.1993, 0029. See also ELI Principles on Blockchain Technology, Smart Contracts and Consumer Protection, (2022), p. 47 ff. This way, the possibility of a void SmC being incorrectly concluded will be significantly reduced. Further, as already mentioned above, autonomous AI systems can dynamically interfere with a contractual procedure, fully replacing human agents, i.e., they can select whether or not to enter a contract, choose the face of the other contractual party and define the contractual content. 144 144 Rizos, \u201cA Contract Law Approach for The Treatment of Smart Contracts \u2018Bugs\u2019\u201d (2022) 5 Eur Rev of Private L 775 (p. 792). In a blockchain environment, AI systems can replace human agents both in posting the SmC onto the platform and accepting it. More specifically, when a user wants a SmC to be concluded and executed, they must render it available on the blockchain platform; namely they must implement it in the smart code using a programming language and \u2018post\u2019 the identification number of the SmC on the blockchain platform. Subsequently, another user of the platform \u2018accepts\u2019 the contract by communicating their acceptance to the other contractual party by paying a certain amount of money and combining the payment with SmC identification number. 145 145 Tjong Tjin Tai (2019), pp. 790-791; Durovic & Jansen (2020), p. 65. See also Cieplak & Leefatt (2017), p. 422. These actions (post and acceptance) could be done autonomously (not just automatically) by oracles using AI. 146 146 Kipker et al. (2020), p. 511; Durovic & Jansen (2020), p. 66. Contra Hasting (2020), p. 375 and Syllaba (2020), p. 19, who characterize SmC's operation autonomous (not automatic). For instance, AI systems can conclude a sale contract on-chain after assessing and comparing counterparties\u2019 offers and reliability; or sell/purchase stocks on-chain after comparing the profitability of various choices; or, similarly, conclude loan contracts on-chain after estimating the creditworthiness of loan applicants. 147 147 See also Sartor (2018), p. 270. This use of AI oracles is expected to be the most revolutionary one since it introduces a new reality for transactions: the \u2018real\u2019 smart contract procedure. This is the contractual procedure carried out by blockchain platforms interacting with AI systems, where a contract's formation/conclusion is going to be autonomous and its performance/execution (at least) automatic, on behalf of its user(s). Nonetheless, despite the positive influence AI oracles can have on SmC, they may also decelerate their operation, 148 148 Meyer (2020), p. 18. while the unknown and maybe inaccurate source of their data/information/knowledge may negatively affect the produced outcome, and the whole procedure as well. Indeed, there is always the possibility an oracle, particularly a software type, could convey false or inaccurate data/information. Although this is a common problem of all oracles (also referred to, in literature, as the oracle problem), 149 149 \u201cThere is no infallible oracle,\u201d Turing (1939). the situation becomes even more difficult for AI oracles due to the inherent opacity they suffer from, i.e., their black box. 150 150 Stazi (2021), p. 81. A typically proposed solution to the oracle problem are the so-called consensus oracles. 151 151 Poblet et al. (2020), p. 5. This is a decentralized network of oracles, which work collectively for the same purpose: before any data is uploaded to the blockchain platform, each oracle renders its outcomes. After considering the outcomes of most of them, or an average amount, the system releases it to the blockchain. 152 152 Cf. Cieplak & Leefatt (2017), p. 424. Such a type of oracle could be useful, e.g., as a rating system within a prediction market. 153 153 Beniiche (2020), p. 2. Nonetheless, the potential of oracle malfunction remains, leading to systematic risks for SmC. For this reason, legal doctrine is called upon to decide what the appropriate legal treatment is, in case the AI oracle negatively affects the SmC operation, namely who should bear any raised civil liability. 5 Legal assessment of AI oracles\u2019 impact upon SmC As already stated, oracles serve as service providers conveying data/information/knowledge from the off-chain world to a blockchain platform, or vice versa (obligation of result). 154 154 Cieplak & Leefatt (2017), p. 423. Any system's malfunction, or transmission of inaccurate data/information/knowledge (henceforth failure) affects SmC and may result, inter allia, in the following situations: (a) in SmC non-performance, although it should have been self-performed (e.g. when an AI oracle conveys inaccurate data about weather conditions, so that the SmC is not self-performed, and the money is not transferred from the insurance company's portfolio to the claimer's one on time); (b) in SmC self-performance, although it should not have been self-performed (e.g. when an AI oracle transmits inaccurate data about weather conditions and the SmC is self-performed, when in fact money should not be released to the claimer; (c) a SmC was concluded, although it should not have been concluded (e.g. a loan-SmC is concluded because the AI oracle transmitted inaccurate information about the creditworthiness of a loan applicant; had it conveyed accurate information thereof, the SmC would have never been concluded; or (d) a SmC was not concluded, although it should have been concluded (e.g. a sales SmC was not concluded because the AI oracle conveyed incorrect data about the stock's price; had it transmitted accurate information thereof, the SmC would have been concluded). The first two types of failures (a, b) apply to any kind of SmC, i.e. to the SmC as a tool for a contract's self-performance and self-execution, to a hybrid contract, as well as to a stand-alone SmC, while the last ones (c, d) apply only to the stand-alone SmC since it is the only kind that is concluded entirely on-chain through the blockchain platform. These situations raise the following issues: first, which person should be held liable in the case of damage; the parties (if so, which of them) or the blockchain platform? Second, if one of the contractual parties, or the platform accordingly, is held liable, can they claim compensation from the AI oracle user and/or producer (provider/designer), or against the AI oracle itself, accordingly? Further, as far as the third situation is concerned, is the contact valid and legally binding upon the contractual parties, or can they be released by their contractual obligations? Accordingly, in the last case, who should be held liable for the SmC non-conclusion and bear the cost of damage? These questions are going to be answered immediately below. 5.1 SmC non-performance due to AI oracles\u2019 failure From a legal perspective, when a SmC is not performed due to the AI oracle's failure, there is a breach of (smart) contract. 155 155 Cf. Rizos (2022), p. 799 ff. The person bearing the raised liability depends, primarily, on who requested the involvement of the AI oracle in the blockchain platform: the contractual parties or the blockchain platform? 5.1.1. Should the AI oracle become involved upon a party's command, this party should bear any contractual liability. 156 156 Cf. Casey & Niblet, \u201cSelf-Driving Contracts\u201d (2017) 43 J of Corporation L (p. 26 ff.). For example, like in case of an off-chain tool that does not function appropriately and negatively affects the transactional outcome, contractual parties should bear the liability in case the AI oracles they use are defective or convey inaccurate data. For instance, in the case of a defective computational oracle, which releases a wrong outcome onto the platform, the party which uses the AI oracle bears the liability. One would reach the same conclusion, even if they do not accept the role of AI autonomous systems as mere tools, but rather as \u2018independent parties\u2019 endowed with \u2018legal personhood\u2019, 157 157 See Solum (1992); Karnow (1996). or as \u2018electronic slaves\u2019 or \u2018hybrid persons\u2019: like in the case of experts that the contractual parties consult in the off-chain world before executing their contractual obligations, the risk of inaccurate knowledge is upon the contractual party who asked for it. Of course, a differentiated liability allocation can result from an agreement between the contractual parties, 158 158 Temte (2019), p. 110; Tjong Tjin Tai (2019), p. 796-797. under general legal conditions, while the platform itself can also predict and manage the issue. Indeed, it will be beneficial for both contractual parties, should they agree in advance which AI oracle is going to be used, namely which AI oracle they both trust, and what will happen in the case of an AI oracle's failure. For instance, they can agree that none of them will be held liable and that the SmC should be performed anyway, retrospectively. As far as the liability of the AI oracle is concerned, the prevalent opinion 159 159 See Allen & Widdison (1996), p. 44; Mehrings (1998), p. 31; Cornelius (2002), p. 355; Boden, Bryson, Caldwell, Dautenhahn, Edwards, Kember et al., (2011), passim. holds the AI user accountable, 160 160 Although the term \u2018user\u2019 is more appropriate to describe the person who exploits an AI system, in the present paper the term \u2018owner\u2019 is adopted because the term \u2018user\u2019 is used to refer to the contractual parties of a SmC. as has already discussed (see above, Section 2.2.). Between the AI user/owner and the on-chain contractual party who asks for the AI oracle's assistance, a service agreement 161 161 See also Ebers, \u201cArtificial Intelligence, Contacting and Contract Law: An Introduction\u201d in Contracting and Contract Law in the age of Artificial Intelligence (Ebers, Poncibo & Zou (eds.)), (Hart Publishing, 2022), p. 20.

See also the Sein, \u201cLegal Tech Solutions as Digital Services under the Digital Content Directive and E-Commerce Directive\u201d in Contracting and Contract Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (Ebers, Poncibo & Zou (eds.)), (Hart Publishing, 2022), p. 135 ff. is concluded but breached due to the AI system's failure, so the latter can claim compensation against the former for non-performance of the (service) contract. 163 163 The same conclusion applies also for the supporters of the mutatis mutandis application of the rules of law about representative (see above, Section 2.2.) as well as for the proponents of the theories of the \u201cAI legal personhood\u201d, \u201celectronic slaves\u201d and \u201ce-person\u201d (see also above, Section 2.2) with the difference that in the last three cases the service contract will have been concluded between the contractual party and the AI system itself. Further, the AI provider or designer can be held liable for the AI oracle's failure as producer or manufacturer of a defective product. In civil law jurisdictions, which are member-states of the European Union, this is a strict liability regime based on the European Directive 84/374 for product liability, 164 164 See also Bertolini (2013), 214; Chatzipanagiotis, \u201cProduct Liability Directive and Software Updates of Automated Vehicles\u201d Proceedings of SETN 2020 <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3759910> accessed 27.6.2023. which is due to be amended soon. 165 165 See European Commission Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Liability of Defected Products COM (2022) 495 final. Accordingly, in common law jurisdictions, it is based, de lege ferenda, inter allia, on the Consumer Protection Act 1987 in the UK, and on section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts in the USA, which are strict liability regimes, too. 166 166 See an extended analysis at Abraham & Rabin (2019), p. 129 ff.; Talley, \u201cAutomatorts: How Should Accident Law Adapt to Autonomous Vehicles?\u201d 2019 Lessons from Law and Economics 10 <https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/ip2-19002-paper.pdf> accessed 17.6.2023. Otherwise, compensation claims against the AI provider or designer can be based on \u2018traditional\u2019 rules of law, like the fault-based tort liability, or, de lege ferenda, vicarious liability, as well as liability for parents and animal keepers. 167 167 The European Commission has already proposed special rules of law regarding the alleviation of the burden of proof in favor of the claimants in cases of fault-based non-contractual civil liability, see European Commission Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on AI liability COM (2022) 496 final. 5.1.2. On the other hand, when the involvement of AI oracles takes place upon the platform's command, it is questionable whether the contractual parties should bear any contractual liability, since they seem to have no default for the produced outcome: even when they know that the uploaded information is inaccurate, they cannot intervene in smart code and inhibit its automatic execution, or trigger it, respectively. For instance, in the afore-mentioned example, the private insurance company holds no responsibility for the fact that the money was not transferred to the claimer's portfolio and could not alter the predefined outcome. This is crucial for civil law systems, where contractual liability is based on the debtor's default, contrary to common law ones where contractual liability is strict, i.e., irrespective of the debtor's default, but for frustration; in this case, it is essential that force majeure clauses be agreed between contractual parties. Further, given that the AI oracle has intervened upon the platform's command, the liability of the blockchain platform should also be investigated. 168 168 See also Savelyev (2017), p. 131. Platforms\u2019 liability depends on the following: first, on its role as a provider of information society services, according to the relevant definition of the European Directive 2000/31 on Electronic Commerce, 169 169 See Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (\u201cDirective on electronic commerce\u201d) OJ L178 17.7.2000, 001, as being recently amended by the Regulation 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (\u201cDigital Service Act (DSA)\u201d). See also thereof de Graaf (2019), passim. or of autonomous ones, i.e. whether they act as mere intermediaries, just facilitating the transaction on-chain, or have a more crucial role in the transaction; 170 170 Cf. Case C-320/16 Uber France SAS v. Nabil Bensalem (2018); Case C-390/18 Airbnb Ireland (2019). second, on its legal nature as a public or private (permissioned) network. 171 171 See an overview Dimitrieva & Schmidt-Kessen (2019), 72, where they discribe the operation of public, consortium and permissioned blockchain platforms. In the latter case, it is reasonably expected that the platform will be responsible for (smart) contract non-performance, so it could be held liable (at least jointly with any liable contractual party) for the breach of (smart) contract. Should the blockchain platform be held liable for (smart) contract non-performance, it can claim compensation against the AI owner for breach of the service contract (or the digital service contract), which has been concluded between them, according to the prevalent opinion (see above, Section 2.2). Moreover, in the case of defective AI design, the AI providers or designers could also be held liable, according to the afore-mentioned rules of law (i.e., the European Directive 85/374, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, and the section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts). In case these legal enactments do not apply, their liability can be based on tort law, or, de lege ferenda, on vicarious liability, or, accordingly, on the rules of law about parents\u2019 or animal keepers\u2019 liability. 5.2 SmC performance due to AI oracles\u2019 failure On the other hand, it is also possible that a SmC is self-performed due to an AI oracle's failure, although it should not have been performed. In this case, there is no breach of contract, but rather a situation of unjust enrichment: 172 172 Cf. Rizos (2022), p. 784, 795. one party (e.g., the insurance claimer) receives a certain benefit at the expense of another (e.g., of the insurance company) via the blockchain platform without justification. Indeed, in the above-mentioned paradigm, there is no valid legal basis for the insurance claimer's enrichment, because the insured risk (e.g., a hurricane or an earthquake) has not occurred and it was the AI system's failure that enabled the unduly payment to be made. Accordingly, because the AI oracle released inaccurate data about stock prices in the blockchain platform, the SmC was self-performed, and the stocks were sold at the wrong price. The remedy for unjust enrichment is restitution, i.e., the restoration of what was conferred to the claimant. Regarding SmC, restitution means that the SmC must be deleted from the ledger retrospectively, or that another SmC with the adverse outcome must be concluded and performed. Further, also in this case, the AI oracle's failure constitutes a breach of the service contract, which has been concluded between the contractual party, or the blockchain platform accordingly, and the AI owner. 173 173 Or with the AI oracle itself, should it be treated as a legal person or an electronic slave or as a hybrid person. What has already been written above in relation to the liability of the AI owner as well as the AI provider or designer applies also in this case (see above, Section 5.1). 5.3 SmC conclusion due to AI oracles\u2019 failure Further, when an AI oracle is used at the conclusion stage of a (stand-alone) SmC, its failure can result in the conclusion of a (stand-alone) SmC that should not have been concluded. For instance, because an AI oracle wrongfully assesses the creditworthiness of a loan applicant and releases this inaccurate information to the blockchain platform, a loan-SmC is concluded between the platform users, i.e. the applicant and the credit institution, that otherwise would never have been concluded. In this case, it is questionable whether the contractual party (e.g. the credit institution) can be released from their contractual obligations. Taking into account the above analysis, one should accept that, when the AI oracle becomes involved in the blockchain platform, upon a contractual party's command, then this party should be held legally bound by the concluded (stand-alone) SmC; that is to say, the (stand-alone) SmC is held valid, and the contractual party who commanded the AI oracle's involvement should perform - in fact, accept the self-performance of - their contractual obligations. The only way to be released from their contractual obligations is by invoking the rules of law about mistake, 174 174 See also Ebers (2022), p. 31 ff.; Poncibo, \u201cRemedies for Artificial Intelligence\u201d in Contracting and Contract Law in the age of Artificial Intelligence (Ebers, Poncibo & Zou (eds.)), (Hart Publishing, 2022), p. 205 ff. if it is so important, i.e. to contend that they would never have entered the (stand-alone smart) contract, had they known the true situation, according to the relevant provisions of each jurisdiction. 175 175 Giancaspro (2017), (passim.). In the above paradigm, where the AI oracle conveyed inaccurate information about the creditworthiness of the loan-applicant, the importance of the mistake is obvious. However, in other paradigms the contractual parties may face great difficulty in proving their mistake. Where they do not rescind the (stand-alone) SmC, they could claim compensation against the AI owner for a breach of contract that they have concluded, as well as against the AI provider or designer for defective design, based on the above analysis (see above, Section 5.1.1). Further, should the AI oracles take part in a contractual procedure upon the blockchain platform's command, the SmC is valid, but the parties are entitled to the right to rescind it on the grounds of it being a mistake. In such a case, it will be easier for the contractual parties to prove their mistake. In addition, they can claim compensation against the blockchain platform, especially if the latter is a private network, and provides the services, i.e. the infrastructure of the platform and the rest of the operations, with a fee (see also above, Section 5.1.2). 5.4 SmC non-conclusion due to AI oracles\u2019 failure An AI oracle's failure can also result in the non-conclusion of a (stand-alone) SmC, even when it was supposed to have been concluded. For instance, if an AI oracle transmitted incorrect information about a stock price (e.g. if it states it is higher or lower than its actual value), then the SmC would not be concluded, because, according to its predefined conditions, the contract can only be concluded when the stock price's value reaches a certain level. On the one hand, should the AI oracle intervene in the contractual procedure upon the parties\u2019 command, the latter bears the risk, i.e. they lose the opportunity to conclude a profitable contract. Nonetheless, they can submit compensation claims (especially loss of profit) against the AI owner for breaching the contract that has been agreed between them. Accordingly, the AI provider or designer can be held liable, either as the producer of a defective product, or according to any of the other legal bases already discussed above (i.e. law of torts, vicarious liability, and parents\u2019 or animal keepers\u2019 liability) (see above, Section 5.1.1). On the other hand, if the AI oracle took part in the contractual procedure upon the blockchain platform's command, the contractual parties could submit compensation claims against the blockchain platform for breach of contract because of the improper function of the platform. However, as already mentioned above (see above Section 5.1.b), the liability of the blockchain platforms depends on various factors: first, on their role as intermediaries (provider of information society services) or as crucial-structural parties of the transaction; second, on their legal nature as public or private (permissioned) networks; third, on the agreement between them and the platforms\u2019 users. Usually when the service (i.e. the infrastructure of the platform and the operations it performs) is offered by a private blockchain network for a fee, it would be agreed, or would be reasonably expected, that the platform bears the liability for the proper operation of its services; so, any improper operation of the platform constitutes a breach of contract that establishes their contractual liability for non-performance. Subsequently, if the blockchain platform is held liable, then it can claim compensation against the AI owner for breach of the contract that has been agreed between them, as well as against the AI provider or designer, in accordance with the above legal analysis (see above Section 5.1.2). 6 Conclusions The interconnection of AI and blockchain technology is expected to bring significant advantages to transactions, altering for good the way people carry out them. Since the invention of the Internet, the interaction of this cutting-edge technology is going to be the next real \u2018big thing\u2019 in the trade industry. However, it also poses significant legal concerns that will only increase in future, as both fields make rapid progress. The present paper constitutes a preliminary study of the interconnection of these novel technologies, putting emphasis on the mechanisms this interconnection is achieved through, the oracles. Should these mechanisms be AI systems, particularly an autonomous one, they can have extended use in transactions carried out through blockchain technology, from the formation and conclusion of a SmC to its performance, execution, and undoing, thus, maximizing SmC potential. However, the use of AI oracles may also raise several legal issues in the event of failure. The present paper focused especially on the contractual liability issues in the case of potential AI oracles\u2019 failures, although non-contractual liability may also exist. The above analysis has shown that any oracle's failure can result, inter allia, in these legal situations: in a SmC non-performance, i.e., a breach of a (smart) contract (see 5.1); in a SmC performance which in fact constitutes an unjust enrichment (see 5.2); in the conclusion of an undesirable SmC (see 5.3); or in the non-conclusion of a desirable one (see 5.4). Moreover, all persons participating in the \u2018smart contractual procedure\u2019, i.e. the contractual parties, as well as the blockchain platform and the AI owner (or the AI system itself), can be held liable, depending on who requested the AI oracle's intervention in the transaction and who is responsible for its proper operation; should the AI oracle intervene in the \u201csmart contract procedure\u201d upon the contractual parties\u2019 command, then the latter bear the most risk, based on the afore-mentioned situations, i.e. they bear the contractual liability (see 5.1.1), or they are obliged to restitute the unjust enrichment (see 5.2), or they are legally bound by a smart (voidable) contract (see 5.3), or, lastly, they lose the opportunity to conclude a profitable (smart) contract. In all these cases, the contractual parties are entitled to the right to claim compensation against: (a) the AI user/owner for non-performance, and/or (b) the AI provider or designer. The latter (i.e. the AI provider or designer) can be held liable, either as the producer of a defected product, or based on the tort liability regime or, de lege ferenda, on vicarious liability, or parents\u2019 or animal keepers\u2019 liability. Accordingly, should the AI oracle intervene in the \u2018smart contractual procedure\u2019 upon the blockchain platform's command, especially when the latter is a private (permissioned) one that plays a crucial role in the transaction and offers its infrastructure for a fee, then it is the platform itself that will bear any increased risk, i.e. they compensate the contractual parties for the non-performance of the SmC (see 5.1.2), or for a performance that should not have happened (see 5.2), or for the conclusion of the stand-alone SmC that should not have been concluded (see 5.3), or for the non-conclusion of the stand-alone SmC that should not have been concluded (see 5.4). Third parties, like the AI providers or designers, may also bear liability in the case of defective AI as the producers of a defective product, 176 176 See also Raskin (2017), 9. 328; Rizos (2022), p. 800. Heading in this direction is the recent proposal of the European Commission for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Liability of Defective Products COM (2022) 495 final. or according to the tort law liability regime, or the vicarious liability, or parents\u2019 or animal keepers\u2019 liability, de lege ferenda. Given that a legislative initiative has already begun, at least regarding AI, and a new legal framework is going to be enacted soon, the legal doctrine should focus on the transactions carried out through blockchain platforms, with the aid of AI systems, and address the newly raised legal issues consistently. The present paper aspires to provide some appropriate legal directions for handling the legal issues raised by the interconnection of SmC and AI.

In the era disruptive technology the emergence of artificial intelligence has fundamentally improved banking operations. The execution of artificial intelligence is no longer discretionary for financial institutions and now it is considered an essential tool to meet customer expectations. Although artificial intelligence enabled digital banking is faster efficient and effective however user acceptance of digital banking driven by artificial intelligence is in its initial stages. Therefore, current study develops and integrated research framework with expectation confirmation model and examines digital banking user satisfaction and acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. Data were collected from digital banking user through structured questionnaire. Overall, 320 respondents were approached and requested to participate in digital banking survey. In return 251 valid responses were received and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings of the structural model indicate that satisfaction is jointly determined by expectation confirmation, perceived performance, trendiness, visual attractiveness, problem solving, customization, communication quality and revealed substantial variance R^2 51.1% in digital banking user satisfaction. Therefore, satisfaction and corporate reputation have shown considerable variance R^2 48.3 in user acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. Moreover, the research framework has revealed substantial predictive power Q^2 0.449 to predict digital banking user satisfaction and Q^2 0.493 user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. Concerning with hypotheses relationships exogenous factors have shown positive and significant impact user satisfaction except trendiness and customization. Practically, this research has suggested that policy makers should pay attention in improving user expectation confirmation, perceived performance, visual attractiveness, communication quality and corporate reputation which in turn enhance satisfaction and boost digital banking user's confidence to accept artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. This study is original as it integrates expectation confirmation model with the antecedents of artificial intelligence and examines user behavior towards acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. Keywords Artificial intelligence Consumer expectations Corporate reputation Trendiness Customization Visual attractiveness Problem solving Communication quality Acceptance of AI enabled banking 1 Introduction The evolution of diverse and disruptive technologies in banking sector has touched heights of digital innovation. For instance in digital banking landscape artificial intelligence enabled digital banking has gained large attention. The modern artificial intelligence driven digital banking services are included facial recognition, conversational bots, voice recognition, machine learning to detect fraud, atomization of cyber security detection, biometrics authentication and humanoid robot [1]. In banking context artificial intelligence enabled banking is defined as application ability to collect data from digital or physical sources, interpret and learn from data and use that data to solve customer queries and complex problems [2,3]. It is established that innovation in digital banking is no longer discretionary and being accepted widely by financial institution to achieve distinct and discern customer experiences [4\u20137]. Although artificial intelligence is studied in e-health Mahdi, Battineni [8] and education setting however little research is found that talked about artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. Therefore, current study has established an amalgamated model with the determinants of artificial intelligence and expectation confirmation model and investigates digital banking user satisfaction and digital banking driven by artificial intelligence. The acceptance of artificial intelligence among fin-tech institutions is still in its initial stages [4]. For instance Ransbotham, Kiron [9] revealed that 39% executives have no strategic plan to execute artificial intelligence enabled technologies in their organizations. On the flip side institutions with artificial intelligence have achieved firm overall performance [10\u201312]. In banking domain Mogaji, Balakrishnan [13] postulated that artificial intelligence could promote customer engagement and therefore theoretical knowledge on this subject must be enhanced. Another study conducted by Omoge, Gala [4] has disclosed that artificial enabled digital banking enhance consumer experience and positively impact consumer buying behavior. In addition to that artificial intelligence in banking has been studied in chatbot adoption context [14]. Although above studies have established basic understanding about artificial intelligence enabled digital banking however these studies lack detail of the artificial intelligence determinants. The current research is unique in this context as it has schematized five core determinants of artificial intelligence which impact digital banking user satisfaction and acceptance of artificial intelligence. This study adds value in information system literature as it integrates expectation confirmation model with artificial intelligence and hence enhance body of knowledge on this subject. The reminder of this paper is followed by literature review, methodology, data analysis, discussion, research contribution and conclusion. 2 Literature review 2.1 Expectation confirmation and user satisfaction The expectation confirmation theory has been remained popular in measuring customer satisfaction while using internet technology [15,16]. The expectation theory was established by Oliver [17] and evaluates user pre-behavioral expectation confirmation/disconfirmation, performance and satisfaction. According to Eren [16] satisfaction is the foundation of user behavior and could be assessed through user expectation confirmation/disconfirmation and service performance. The term customer expectation is defined as what customers expect and what they will receive in return to avail that service [15,18,19]. Therefore, perceived performance represents to customer perception about service attributes, benefits and outcomes [15,18]. This indicates that users first have expectation confirmation or disconfirmation about artificial intelligence enabled banking. If user expectation towards AI based banking meets with user needs and boosts customer satisfaction. Nevertheless, expectation disconfirmation develops negative behavior towards AI based banking [20\u201322]. On the flip side positive confirmation boost perceived performance resulting higher user satisfaction towards acceptance of artificial intelligence [23,24]. Prior studies have used expectation confirmation theory as theoretical lens to understand user expectation confirmation/disconfirmation and perceived usefulness towards technology services [16,20,23,25,26]. Therefore, following hypotheses are postulated. H1 Expectation confirmation positively relates to user satisfaction. H2 Expectation confirmation positively relates to user perceived performance. H3 Perceived performance positively relates to user satisfaction. 2.2 Artificial intelligence features and user satisfaction The artificial intelligence features like trendiness, attractiveness and problem solving have made banking operations more attractive, appealing and innovative. For instance author like Chung, Ko [27] stated that customer prefer to use trendy services instead of conventional services. Another dynamic change in business world is that salesperson importance has been reduced and now customers are relying on online system to uplift their life style [28]. Earlier studies have revealed that artificial intelligence based digital banking meet with customers need and their trendy life style which in turn enhance user satisfaction [27\u201329]. Aside of trendiness digital banking services should be attractive and appealing [30\u201332]. The term visual attractiveness is seen as individual perception that online interface is colorful, bright, clean, clear, creative, expressive and attract user [33]. In banking context author like Kuo [34] has asserted that visual attractiveness leads to a feeling of arousal and excitement and reduces banking user switching intention. Similarly extensive literature has confirmed that good aesthetic design influence e-user satisfaction and boost customer experiences [30,35\u201337]. Another important aspect of technology is that it should be problem solving [38]. Therefore, artificial intelligence in digital banking enabled services provider to handle customer problems round the clock resulting higher customer satisfaction [27,38]. Thus, following hypotheses are assumed. H4 Trendiness of AI positively relates to user satisfaction. H5 Visual attractiveness of AI positively relates to user satisfaction. H6 Problem solving of AI positively relates to user satisfaction. Measuring e-commerce user's need with a single parameter is critical and therefore customization is essential in e-services [39]. The term customization is the degree wherein e-service can be modified, personalized, and adaptable to satisfy customer needs and preferences. According to Perna, Runfola [40] customization in e-service develops strong association between service provider and customers resulting high satisfaction and loyalty towards product. Prior studies have confirmed that artificial intelligence based applications assist customers to avail customized services through chatbot and satisfy their needs [27,41]. Similarly, in digital banking scenario it is found that artificial intelligence enabled banking comprises customization features to assist banking user and enhance digital banking user satisfaction. Communication quality is another essential feature of artificial intelligence based banking. Communication quality is the degree wherein service agent provides accurate, credible, efficient, problem solving and time saving information to customers [41,42]. According to Chakrabarty, Widing [43] rich contents and relevant information reduces uncertainty and enhance customer satisfaction. Moreover, studies have established that e-service agents provide efficient information about product/service, build positive relationship and boost customer satisfaction towards digital banking service [13,43,44]. It is also found that if consumers perceive adequate quality communication through e-service agent, they will enjoy artificial intelligence based digital banking [27,28,44]. In light of above discussion and supported by Mogaji, Balakrishnan [13], Chung, Ko [27], De Andrade and Tumelero [41] following hypotheses are proposed. H7 Customization feature of AI positively relates to user satisfaction. H8 Communication quality feature of AI positively relates to user satisfaction. 2.3 Corporate reputation The corporate reputation is an essential element in e-commerce and contributes to firm value. There is strong evidence that corporate reputation positively influence user attitude, reduce anxiety and uncertainty towards digital banking products [45]. Therefore, corporate reputation is outlined research framework as shown in Fig. 1 . In this study corporate reputation is defined as user overall evaluation of digital banking service, interaction with stake holders, communication activities, credibility, reliability, trustworthiness and ongoing corporate activities with service provider [45]. Author like Eren [16] has asserted that corporate reputation is a collective representation of a firms services. It is argued that when customers have less information about e-service they rely on corporate reputation [46,47]. Prior studies have confirmed that corporate reputation enhance e-banking user satisfaction boost user confidence [46,47]. In the context of artificial intelligence author like Eren [16] has confirmed that corporate reputation enhance user satisfaction. Therefore, this study extends the body of knowledge and test causal relationship between user satisfaction and acceptance of artificial intelligence based digital banking and hence formulate following hypothesis. H9 User satisfaction positively relates to user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled banking. H10 Corporate reputation positively relates to user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled banking. 3 Research methodology 3.1 Instrument development The research model of this study is empirically investigated through survey questionnaire. Consistent with positivism research paradigm survey questionnaire is designed and comprise respondents demographic characteristics and scale items. In first section of the questionnaires respondents\u2019 age, gender, education and occupation were asked. Therefore, in second part of survey questionnaire scale items were adopted from prior research studies. The current study model comprises ten latent construct that were measured through scale items. Constructs item for expectation confirmation and perceived performance were adopted from Rahi, Othman Mansour [48]. Instrument for trendiness, problem solving and customization were adopted from Lee and Choi [49] and Chung, Ko [27]. Similarly, satisfaction and communication items were adopted from Chung, Ko [27] and Joosten, Bloemer [50]. Next to this visual attractiveness items were adopted from Lee and Pan [33]. Scale for the construct acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled banking were adopted from Rodrigues, Costa [51]. Therefore, corporate reputation items were adopted from Ageeva, Melewar [52]. Concerning with Likert scale extensive literature has established that five-point Likert scale is more favorable when comparing with seven-point Liker scale [53\u201355]. Therefore, construct items were measured on five-point Likert scale wherein 1 stands for strongly disagree and 5 indicate to strongly agree. Scale items are exhibited in Table 1 . 3.2 Sampling and data collection This study investigates factors that impact customer intention to accept artificial intelligence in digital banking. Gauging technology user's behavior is a complex phenomenon and hence caution should be paid in selecting relevant respondents [15]. Therefore, in current research setting digital banking user were identified appropriate respondents when comparing with non-digital banking customers. Consequently the population of this study is digital banking users from all commercial and Islamic banks located in Pakistan. The nature of this study is cross sectional and collects data at one point in time. The priori power analysis is employed for sample size computation [53,56,57]. Result as shown in appendix 1 indicate that sample size of 172 respondents was enough for empirical investigation. Nevertheless, earlier studies have argued that sampling error could be reduced if sample size is higher. Consistently, researcher target is to collect maximum responses using survey questionnaires. Data were collected through convenience sampling approach that has substantial support from literature and seems appropriate in business studies [48,53,58]. Overall, 320 respondents were requested to fill digital banking survey questionnaire. Research survey was started in 2nd week of December 2022 and ended in 1st week of January 2023. In research survey participation was voluntarily with promise that personal information will not be revealed. Among 320 respondents 254 respondents have shown interest to participate in digital banking survey. However, questionnaires were further screened out and 3 questionnaires were discarded due to inappropriate and blank answers. Therefore, 251 responses were used in structural model assessment. 4 Data analysis Data were analyzed with structural equation modeling approach. The structural equation modeling is a multivariate data analysis technique that evaluate complex model. Moreover variance based (VB-SEM) approach is taken for path estimation. According to Rahi [59] variance based structural equation molding is favorable when research framework is less developed. Therefore, partial least square based SEM is taken for data calculation. Data were estimated with SmartPLS4 software [60]. 4.1 Structural equation modeling (SEM) The structural equation modeling is two-stage approach comprising measurement model and structural model [59,61]. In first stage factors reliability, items reliability, convergent and discriminant validity of the measures were established. Table 1 depicts indicators reliability as factor loading is satisfactory i.e. \u22650.60. Likewise, factors reliability is achieved following threshold value \u2265 0.70 of cronbach alpha and composite reliability [59,61]. Convergent validity was confirmed following threshold value of AVE \u22650.50 average variance extracted [57,59]. Thus, measurement model has confirmed factors reliability, items reliability and convergent validity of the measure. To get accurate estimation it is mandatory that construct should be discriminant and measure distinct concepts. Therefore, discriminant validity is established with cross loading method [56,62]. The cross loading comparison indicate that loadings of the indicators were higher when comparing with other indicators loading and hence confirming discriminant validity. Table 2 exhibits results of the cross loading analysis. The Heterotrait monotrait ratio analysis is incorporated to confirm discriminant validity of the factors. The HTMT analysis is the latest statistical approach to measure discriminant validity of the factors [57,63,64]. To confirm discriminant validity researcher has followed guidelines provided by Kline [64] and Gold, Malhotra [63]. It is recommended that threshold values of heterotrait monotrait ratios must be \u2264 0.85 or \u2264 0.90 demonstrating adequate discriminant validity of the factors. Results revealed that none of the HTMT value was higher than 0.85 and hence establishing discriminant validity of the factors. Results of the HTMT analysis are shown in Table 3 . Another method to measure discriminant validity is known as fornell and larcker criterion [65]. This method estimates factors discriminant validity through square root of average variance extracted [65]. Results of the PLS algorithm had disclosed that values of AVE were higher than other factors and hence confirming discriminant validity of the constructs. Table 4 depicts findings of the Fornell & Larcker analysis. 4.2 Predictor-criterion lateral multicollineraity The multicollinearity issue can lead towards skewness resulting inaccurate or misleading findings [62,66]. Therefore, lateral multicollineraity is assessed with variance inflation factor. According to Rahi, Ghani [62] when measuring predictor and criterion variables the values of variance inflation factor should not be greater than 3.3 [53,67]. Results of the variance inflation factor revealed that VIF values were less than threshold value 3.3 and hence establishing data validity. Findings of the VIF analysis are shown in Table 5 . 4.3 Hypotheses testing Research hypotheses were tested in second stage of SEM namely structural model assessment. Data were bootstrapped with sample of 5000 consistent with prior studies [68,69]. According to Rahi [69] bootstrapping method mitigate data normality issue and must be incorporated in structural model assessment. Results of the structural model had revealed beta values, t-values, standard errors and p-value to accept or reject hypotheses. Results of the hypotheses analysis are exhibited in Table 6 . The causal relationship among hypotheses is tested through structural model assessment. Results revealed significant impact of expectation confirmation towards user satisfaction and confirmed with \u03b2 = 0.204 path, STD-error 0.074, t-statistics 2.776 and significance p 0.003 and confirmed H1. Similarly, expectation confirmation has shown positive impact perceived performance and supported by \u03b2 = 0.489 path, STD-error 0.061, t-statistics 7.962 and significance p 0.000 hence confirming H2. Therefore, the perceived performance has shown positive impact in determining user satisfaction and confirmed H3: \u03b2 = 0.178 path, STD-error 0.084, t-statistics 2.115 and significance p 0.018. Concerning with artificial intelligence factors results indicate that trendiness had insignificant impact user satisfaction and therefore H4 was rejected \u03b2 = 0.099 path, STD-error 0.067, t-statistics 1.490 and significance p 0.070. The visual attractiveness has shown significant impact user satisfaction and statistically supported by \u03b2 = 0.133 path, STD-error 0.064, t-statistics 2.084 and significance p 0.020 thus accepting H5. Next to this problem solving factors of artificial intelligence has confirmed positive impact user satisfaction and supported by H6: \u03b2 = 0.148 path, STD-error 0.083, t-statistics 1.782 and significance p 0.039. Moving further customization has shown insignificant impact user satisfaction and thus rejected H7: \u03b2 = 0.013 path, STD-error 0.064, t-statistics 0.208 and significance p 0.418. Communication is another essential factor of artificial intelligence and has shown positive impact user satisfaction and statistically confirmed by H8: \u03b2 = 0.123path, STD-error 0.068, t-statistics 1.812and significance p 0.036. User satisfaction has revealed positive impact in determining user acceptance of artificial enabled banking and statistically confirmed by H9: \u03b2 = 0.194 path, STD-error 0.050, t-statistics 3.903 and significance p 0.000. Similarly, corporate reputation has revealed positive impact user satisfaction and confirmed by H10: \u03b2 = 0.556 path, STD-error 0.044, t-statistics 12.601 and significance p 0.000. Results of the hypotheses can be seen in Appendix 2. The overall impact of exogenous factors is measured with coefficient of determination. It is found that digital banking user satisfaction is jointly determined by expectation confirmation, perceived performance, trendiness, visual attractiveness, problem solving, customization, communication quality and revealed substantial variance R 2 51.1% in digital banking user satisfaction. Therefore, user satisfaction and corporate reputation have shown considerable variance R 2 0.483 in user acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. In addition to that predictive power Q 2 of the research model is assessed. Results had revealed that model has substantial predictive power Q 2 0.449 to measure digital banking user satisfaction and Q 2 0.493 user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. 4.4 Factors effect size analysis The research model is further scrutinized with effect size analysis f 2 [59]. According to Rahi [69] f-square values reveal actual impact of factors and therefore must be incorporated in data analysis. The threshold values of f 2 are considered large at 0.35, medium effect at 0.15 and 0.02 represent to small effect size [59]. Results as depicted in Table 7 indicate that customization has zero effect size this is due the fact that the relationship between customization and user satisfaction was also insignificant. Therefore, all other factors have shown small effect in measuring digital banking user satisfaction. On the flip side corporate reputation has revealed large effect size in measuring user acceptance of artificial enabled digital banking. Within integration the expectation confirmation has shown large effect size in determining perceived performance. 4.5 Importance performance analysis The importance and performance of the outlined factors were established with importance performance matrix. The importance and performance of the factors assist managers and policy makers to understand actual strength of the factors within integrated research framework [59,69]. To calculate IPMA analysis it is mandatory to select an outcome variable. Therefore, research has selected user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled banking as an outcome variable. Data were estimated using SmartPLS4. Results as depicted in Table 8 have shown that corporate reputation is the most important factor in measuring user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled banking. Therefore, user satisfaction is the second most important factor in determining user acceptance of artificial intelligence based digital banking. Therefore, the importance of customization is not attractive when comparing corresponding factors like communication quality, expectation confirmation, perceived performance, problem solving, trendiness and visual attractiveness. Data were further explored with importance-performance map as given in Fig. 2 . The vertical side of the map is showing performance level therefore importance of the factors can be found in horizontal gradient. For managerial point of view factors like corporate reputation, user satisfaction, expectation, problem solving and visual attractiveness are important to be taken into consideration. 5 Discussion In the era of technology advancement and innovative disruption, the artificial intelligence enabled banking has appeared an alternative technology to manage online banking channel, services and solutions. Although advent of artificial intelligence in digital banking has enriched digital banking services however acceptance of AI enabled digital banking and meeting digital banking user expectation are still ongoing issues. Therefore, the present study develops an amalgamated framework to investigate user satisfaction and acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. The research framework has integrated expectation confirmation model with artificial intelligence factors and investigated customer satisfaction towards AI enabled digital banking. Research framework was empirically tested with observation retrieved from digital banking users. The empirical findings of this study have established that expectation confirmation is significantly related to user satisfaction, perceived performance and consistent with prior studies Rahi, Alghizzawi [15], Eren [16]. Similarly, perceived performance has shown positive impact in determining user satisfaction and consistent with Brill, Munoz [23]. Thus, empirical findings have confirmed that digital banking led by artificial intelligence meet customer expectation and boost satisfaction. Concerning with artificial intelligence factors results indicate that trendiness had insignificant impact user satisfaction and hence rejecting argument developed by Chung, Ko [27]. Therefore, visual attractiveness has shown positive impact user satisfaction and consistent with prior studies Bhandari, Chang [30], Gupta, Gaurav [31], Ho, Le [32]. Moving further problem solving and communication quality have shown positive influence user satisfaction and in line with prior researchers findings [13,43,44]. Contrary to research expectation relationship between customization and satisfaction was found insignificant and hence rejected arguments developed by Perna, Runfola [40]. This is happened because Artificial intelligence is disruptive technology and users had felt difficulty in customization resulting negative feedback. This study has also confirmed that satisfaction and corporate reputation positively impact user behavior to accept digital banking and consistent with Narteh and Braimah [46], \u00d6zkan, S\u00fcer [47]. Collectively results have shown that expectation confirmation, perceived performance, visual attractiveness, problem solving, communication trendiness and customization explained substantial variance R 2 51.1% in digital banking user satisfaction. Likewise, satisfaction and corporate reputation have shown considerable variance R 2 0.483 in user acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. The predicative power of the research framework was found substantial Q 2 0.449 and Q 2 0.493 for satisfaction and user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. In following section research contributions are given in detail. 6 Research contribution to theory, method and practice In terms of contributions this study has several contributions to theory, method and practice. Theoretically, this study has examined impact of expectation confirmation model towards customer satisfaction and acceptance of artificial enabled digital banking and contributes to information system literature. Similarly, this study has confirmed that factors such as visual attractiveness, problem solving and communication quality are essential artificial intelligence factor and enhance user satisfaction and acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. Another theoretical contribution of this study is the integration of expectation confirmation model with artificial intelligence factors. For instance this study integrates factors underpinned expectation confirmation model with visual attractiveness, problem solving, communication quality, corporate reputation, trendiness and customization and investigate user satisfaction and acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. Pointing to methodological contribution this study has analyzed data with multivariate data analysis approach namely structural equation Modeling. In addition to that sample size is computed with priori power analysis and hence strengthens research methods. Another contribution to methods is to test research model predictive power with predictive power Q 2 analysis. Concerning with practical contributions it is found that user expectation confirmation has large effect in determining perceived performance. Therefore, factor like corporate reputation has shown large effect in measuring user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled banking. In order to reduce model complexity and for clear managerial directions researcher has analyzed data with importance performance matrix. Results revealed that corporate reputation and user satisfaction are key factors which boost digital banking user confidence towards acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled banking. Similarly, the importance of expectation confirmation, perceived performance, visual attractiveness and communication quality was found considerable. These findings clearly indicate that managers and policy makers should pay attention in improving user expectation confirmation, perceived performance, visual attractiveness, communication quality and corporate reputation which in turn enhance user satisfaction and encourage digital banking user to accept and use of artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. 6.1 Research limitations and future directions Although this study has disclosed several useful findings for researcher and practitioners however, it is important acknowledge research limitations for future research directions. First, this study has schematized five core factors of artificial intelligence namely trendiness, customization, communication quality, problem solving and visual attractiveness. Nevertheless, future researcher should not be restricted to these AI factors and hence suggested to add more factors comprising artificial intelligence characteristics. Second, this study has examined user satisfaction and acceptance of artificial intelligence in digital banking. Nonetheless, it is suggested that future researchers should analyze underpinned factors in determining user continuance intention instead of initial acceptance. Third, the research model comprise multiple factors with several assumption and hence complex in nature. Therefore, mediating effect of user satisfaction between user AI acceptance and expectation confirmation was not tested. Thus, future researchers may explore mediating and moderating relationship of artificial intelligence factors and expectation confirmation model towards acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. Fourth, this study is cross sectional and collects user observation at one point in time. Nevertheless, longitudinal research is suggested to reveal interesting findings that how user behavior changes at different stages starting from initial acceptance to continuance use of AI intelligence enabled banking. Finally, this study is conducted in developing country context and therefore replicating current research model in developed region could reveal interesting findings. 7 Conclusion Disruptive technology like artificial intelligence in banking sector is becoming essential to encounter customer expectation and satisfaction. In digital banking landscape artificial intelligence is across the board and could find in facial recognition, conversational bots, voice recognition, machine learning to detect fraud, cyber security detection, biometrics authentication and humanoid robot. Although artificial intelligence enabled banking brings efficiency in data interpretation and have capability to solve customer queries and complex problems the acceptance of AI enabled digital banking is still in its initial stages. Therefore, current study develops and integrated research framework with expectation confirmation model and examines user behavior towards acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. For research design the positivism research paradigm is opted. Data were collected from digital banking user through structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed with structural equation modeling. Results indicate that satisfaction is jointly determined by expectation confirmation, perceived performance, trendiness, visual attractiveness, problem solving, customization, communication quality and revealed substantial variance R 2 51.1% in digital banking user satisfaction. Therefore, satisfaction and corporate reputation have shown considerable variance R 2 48.3 in user acceptance of AI enabled digital banking. Moreover, the research framework has revealed substantial predictive power Q 2 0.449 to predict digital banking user satisfaction and Q 2 0.493 user acceptance of artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. Although all exogenous factors have shown positive impact user satisfaction nevertheless the impact of trendiness and customization was found insignificant in determining digital banking user satisfaction. This study contributes to theory and practice in several ways. For instance this study has integrated expectation confirmation model with antecedents of artificial intelligence namely visual attractiveness, customization, problem solving, communication quality and trendiness and examine digital banking user satisfaction. Therefore, integration of expectation confirmation model with antecedents of artificial intelligence contributes to formation system literature. Moving further this research has concluded that managers should pay attention in improving user expectation confirmation, perceived performance, visual attractiveness, communication quality and corporate reputation to boost digital banking user's confidence to accept artificial intelligence enabled digital banking. This study is unique as it has identified core antecedents of artificial intelligence namely trendiness, communication quality, problem solving, customization and visual attractiveness and examine digital banking user satisfaction.

Azerbaijan State Economic University Hasan Aliyev 135 Narimanov Baku AZ1072 Azerbaijan This study examines the effect of artificial intelligence on unemployment in high-tech developed countries. While artificial intelligence is more discussed in futuristic aspects, comprehensive empirical studies are limited in the literature. Therefore, this study uses the dataset, which includes 24 high-tech developed countries from 2005 to 2021 and examines the relationship between a country's Google Trend Index related to AI and the unemployment rate. In the empirical approach, we control the dynamic effect of unemployment by using dynamic panel data and GMM-system estimation to determine the effect of AI on unemployment. The main results show that artificial intelligence decreases the level of unemployment, and the \u2018displacement effect\u2019 of AI is validated. Keywords Artificial intelligence Unemployment Dynamic panel data JEL Classification F22 C23 O17 1 Introduction In the past decades, the evolution and widespread diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation have led to considerable inspiration and significant transformation in different industries, from medical diagnosis and autopilot transportation to advanced manufacturing. Francis Gurry notes that \u201cartificial intelligence is a new digital frontier that will have a profound impact on the world, transforming the way we live and work.\u201d (WIPO, 2019) The exponential growth in digitalized data and breakthrough computational power (Moore's Law) have enabled artificial intelligence to generate a revolutionary influence (Moore, 2006). Modern information technologies and the advent of cognitive machines powered by artificial intelligence (AI) have powerfully transformed people's lives and work. While artificial intelligence can amplify productivity in some industries, there are instances where it can take over human work and revolutionize occupations. Machine learning, computer vision, neural networks, and others related to AI have simplified daily tasks and even shaped humans' regular practice. On the other hand, a core component of the next generation of AI is natural language understanding (NLU), and a breakthrough in its core technology is of great scientific significance and industrial value. Language modeling includes performing abstract and mathematical modeling of natural language using computers, which is one of the principal scientific challenges of NLU. In the era of deep learning, pre-trained language models (represented by ELMo, BERT, and GPT) have profoundly impacted the field of natural language processing (NLP) and are regarded as a milestone in NLP (Chowdhary & Chowdhary, 2020). The most common example of this today is Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI (Taecharungroj, 2023). The emergence of GPT-4-based applications in recent days has made artificial intelligence a phenomenon and has also created a broad debate about the role of humans in the job market. Hence, advances in artificial intelligence technologies have sparked discussions about the future of jobs and, more importantly, whether humans will have any jobs in the future. The impact of AI on employment has aroused widespread interest (Goos et al., 2009; David, 2017; Oschinski & Wyonch, 2017; Acemoglu et al., 2022). These discussions are not new, and they have always existed in the fluctuations of work automation (Jenkins & Sherman, 1979). However, despite all the fluctuations, most job losses did not happen (Whitley & Wilson, 1982). However, the present day is different because artificial intelligence, linked with increased data accessibility and managing power, allows supercomputers to operate on much more assignments than the previous effects of digitalization (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014). \u201cFuture strategic advantage depends on the ability to leverage artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, computer vision, and autonomous systems, and integrate it with the workforce to create symbiotic human\u2013machine teams,\u201d according to Rahwan et al. (2019). On the other hand, the relationship between AI and unemployment is simple in economic theory, and it is referred to as a \u201cpass-through\u201d to labor productivity. According to Stevenson (2019), AI improves GDP growth by increasing productivity and future earnings. In this respect, AI is like other new technologies, similarly increasing productivity and economic growth and decreasing unemployment. Separate phases of structural unemployment can be recorded, but they are only temporary because they disappear once the labor market returns to stability. In the literature, descriptive and comparative analyses are used while examining the relationships between artificial intelligence and unemployment, and no comprehensive econometric model is suggested to determine this relationship. One of the main reasons for this is the need for systematic data to measure the use of artificial intelligence. Hence, alternative data sources such as Google Trends (trends.google.com) can improve unemployment modeling. The Google Trends Index (GTI) tracks word or phrase patterns entered by the Google search engine. Attempts to integrate GTIs into the predictive model have been successful up to the present (Nagao et al., 2019; Mihaela, 2020; Simionescu & Cifuentes-Faura, 2022). From this perspective, this study uses GTIs related to AI in 24 high-tech developed countries to determine the relationship between AI and the unemployment rate. First, this study proposes a comprehensive analysis focusing on 24 high-tech developed countries compared to current studies. Second, this study is one of the first to use a dynamic panel data estimation method to examine the impact of artificial intelligence on unemployment. 2 Literature review In the most recent few years, the literature on the topic of the effect of AI on unemployment has notably expanded (Ernst et al., 2019; Martens & Tolan, 2018), while various contributions consider AI as a component of a more complicated automation procedure (Wang & Siau, 2019). Generally, two-fold approaches can be discovered. The initial part of the scholars supports a \u2018replacement effect' of jobs by AI, and the next part of the scholars supports a \u2018displacement effect\u2019 of jobs. The first part of the literature validates the \u2018\u2018replacement effect\u2019\u2019, which consists of various aspects. In this part, the application of artificial intelligence negatively impacts the labor market, causing unemployment because of being without a job as an outcome of replacement. Some of the first academic studies about the negative impact of AI on employment belong to Leontief (1983). He highlights that nearly the entire workforce would be replaced by AI in future decades, expanding unemployment as an outcome. Ngo et al. (2014) discovered that 48% of specialists in the technology field believe robots may possibly perform the most standardized and automated labor. Consequently, in the age of AI, except for a few highly skilled employees in related industries, traditional jobs will be at risk of unemployment. Susskind and Susskind (2016) consider that in the age of artificial intelligence, high-tech unemployment will be additionally increased, and the work in traditional industries will be processed into routine labor, which technologies will replace. Frey and Osborne (2017) constructed a model, and the study found that 47% of 700 occupations are at risk of being replaced in the next two decades. David (2017) pointed out that the jobs with high substitution risk and no gender difference are as high as 55% with AI. Graetz and Michaels (2018) discovered that robots decreased responsibilities more for low-skilled labor than for medium-skilled and high-skilled labor. In addition, Felten et al. (2018) and Fossen and Sorgner (2019) found that a high computerization risk is associated with an increasing likelihood of changing occupations or being unemployed. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) used a task-based theoretical framework to analyze the effect of robot density on local labor markets in the US, and they found that one additional robot per thousand workers is associated with a drop of 0.2 percent in the employment-to-population ratio and it decreases in wages of 0.37 percent. They also emphasized the heterogeneity of the effects by showing that the lower the workers\u2019 level of education, the stronger the negative impact on jobs and hourly wages. Georgieff and Milanez (2021) analyze whether jobs considered at high risk of automation in 2012 experienced a net loss of workers seven years later. They found that these occupations saw weaker employment growth than other jobs and even sometimes a modest decline in employment levels. Ma et al. (2022) show that the development of artificial intelligence will significantly affect the structure of employment skills, and regional innovation has a significant mediating effect. With the improvement of innovation, industrial upgrading, and technological progress, the influence of artificial intelligence on middle-skill employment has gradually weakened. Under the influence of an innovative environment and technological progress, high-skilled employment shows a U-shaped change. The second part of the literature proposes the \u2018\u2018displacement effect\u2019\u2019. In this respect, AI positively impacts the labor market, decreasing the unemployment level because of its job-creating effect. Scholars believe that although artificial intelligence will have an impact on the job market in the short term, due to the substantial increase in production efficiency, the expansion of production will create more jobs and employment opportunities in the long term. Boden (1987), the Nobel Prize winner in economics, claims that AI development is replicable. According to him, \u201cthere will be all sorts of problems in the transition period, but finally, there will be many more jobs created\u2014different perhaps, but many more jobs than there were before\u2014so we do not need to worry about the unemployment issue in the long term''. According to the McKinsey Global Institute Research (2016) study group, which strengthens this theory, there will be a demand for 250,000 data scientists by 2024. Along the same lines, Dauth et al. (2018) looked at the effects of robot adoption on the German labor market and found that it has changed the job distribution across industries without decreasing the aggregate level of employment. On the other hand, Gries and Naud\u00e9 (2018) integrate artificial intelligence into an economic growth model with limitations on total demand. They claimed that artificial intelligence did not directly lead to an increase in unemployment. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018), who investigate the relationship between artificial intelligence, automation, and work, have come to some interesting results. AI and automation, they claim, improve productivity, which is then supported by additional capital accumulation. By way of additional capital, current work will be technically advanced using a more skilled worker, which creates new jobs. Chang-jun et al. (2019) believe that universities are more effective in improving professional skills and guiding good personality characteristics, which can help graduates reduce the risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence. Webb (2019), who found that jobs with high exposure to automation technologies experienced a decline in employment and wages, Aghion et al. (2020) used French data and found that automation positively impacts employment at the firm and industry levels. Koch et al. (2021) analyzed a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms. They pointed out that robot adoption led to a net increase in jobs of 10%, while firms that did not invest in robots suffered job losses over the period. On the other hand, the authors point out that, at the aggregate level, automation does not result in net job destruction and creation. Felten et al. (2019) proposed an \u201cAI Occupational Impact\u201d measure and found that, while artificial intelligence has a small positive effect on wages, it has no impact on employment. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) used data on online vacancies and found no correlation between AI exposure and employment or wages. Although artificial intelligence and unemployment are discussed in various aspects in the literature, empirical studies are limited. Hence, this study fills the three most important research gaps. The first is associated with the lack of empirical papers concentrating on artificial intelligence and unemployment. While previous research has discussed AI's futuristic aspects, this study develops an empirical econometric model. The second gap is associated with the lack of large datasets. In addition to previous studies, this study uses a 17-year (2005\u20132021) dataset covering panel data from 24 high-tech developed countries. This increases the validity and reliability of the model results. The third gap is the lack of a systematic dataset of AI used for discovering the relationship between AI and unemployment. Therefore, this study uses GTI, which will be a proxy variable for the use of AI. 3 Methodology This section decides on the econometric method to investigate the relationship between AI and unemployment. Unemployment measures the number of people currently without a job over a particular period, such as a month, quarter, or year. It is a measure of the current state of the labor market and reflects the number of people who are actively seeking employment but are unable to find work at a given point in time. The dynamic lag effect is essential for unemployment because economic conditions and policies may take some time to impact the labor market. For example, a government stimulus program may take several months to be implemented and for its effects to be felt in terms of job creation or retention. Similarly, a recession may take some time to affect the unemployment rate, as businesses may initially try to avoid layoffs by reducing hours or wages. In addition, even after the economy has recovered from a recession, it may take some time for the labor market to fully recover and for the unemployment rate to return to pre-recession levels. This is because some workers may have left the labor force or become discouraged from seeking employment during the recession and may take some time to re-enter the labor market. Overall, considering the dynamic effect when analyzing changes in the labor market can provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of unemployment and the factors that contribute to it. As a result, we use a dynamic panel data (DPD) model to focus on the dynamic effect of unemployment in this study. Several different econometric methods have been proposed to estimate DPD models. The DPD model allows for the endogeneity of explanatory variables and accounts for unobservable, time-invariant country effects (Baek, 2016; Yerdelen Tato\u011flu, 2018). To address the concern of endogeneity with explanatory variables, Arellano and Bond (1991) first suggested using the difference generalized method of moments (difference GMM), whereby instrumental variables are used for deriving the GMM of corresponding moment conditions. The basic principle is that this method takes the first difference of the regression equation to eliminate the individual fixed effects and then uses the lagged variable as the instrumental variable of endogenous variables in the difference equation. While it is an effective method for mitigating the endogeneity issue, it suffers from the concern of \u201cweak instruments\u201d in the case of finite samples and results in low precision (Bond et al., 2001). A solution to this problem is proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998), who suggested using the system GMM estimator that employs lagged variables as instruments in both the difference and the level equations. (1) y it = \u2211 j = 1 p \u03b1 j y i , t - j + x it \u03b2 1 + w it \u03b2 2 + \u03bd i + \u2208 it i = 1 , \u2026 , N t = 1 , \u2026 , T Where the \u03b1 j are p parameters to be estimated, x it is a 1 \u00d7 k 1 vector of strictly exogenous covariates, \u03b2 1 is a k 1 \u00d7 1 vector of parameters to be estimated, w it is a 1 \u00d7 k 2 vector of predetermined or endogenous covariates, \u03b2 2 is a k 2 \u00d7 1 vector of parameters to be estimated, \u03bd i are the panel-level effects (which may be correlated with the covariates), and \u220a it are i.i.d. over the whole sample with variance \u03c3 \u2208 2 . The \u03bd i and the \u2208 it are assumed to be independent for each i overall t . This method involves a system of two equations: an equation for differences with lagged levels as instrumental variables and an equation for levels with lagged differences as instrumental variables. In addition to addressing the endogeneity concern, system GMM can take care of omitted variable bias, multicollinearity concerns, unobserved country heterogeneity issues, and measurement errors that are common in pooled ordinary least squares and fixed effect regression methods (Bond et al., 2001). It can also give better results than the different GMM estimators, which may generate biased and imprecise estimates (Arellano & Bover, 1995; Blundell & Bond, 1998). Therefore, this study relies on the system GMM estimation method for the dynamic panel data analysis. Although system GMM results are considered advantageous, it is vital to assess the consistency of its estimation, which is determined by the validity of the instruments and the absence of second-order serial correlation in the first-differenced residuals. Instrumental variables are considered valid when there is no correlation between the error term and the instruments, as tested by Sargan and Hansen tests (Akay, 2015; Baek, 2016; Yerdelen Tato\u011flu, 2018). And the second-order serial correlation is tested by Arellano-Bond tests (Teixeira & Queir\u00f3s, 2016). There are two variants of system GMM, namely, one-step and two-step estimation methods, depending on whether the weight matrix is homoscedastic or heteroscedastic. Two-step estimators are widely acknowledged to be more efficient because, with limited samples, this method reduces bias from the standard errors of the estimation values (Bond et al., 2001). However, system GMM may produce many instrumental variables as the number of periods increases, which, in turn, can overfit the model and result in low model specification (Roodman, 2009). Hence, using a one-step system GMM is recommended for a model with a small number of countries and a more extended period of time, and a two-step system GMM is encouraged for a model with a large number of countries and a shorter period (Teixeira & Queir\u00f3s, 2016). Therefore, given that our analysis involves data from 24 high-tech developed countries over 17 years, we preferred the findings of the two-step system GMM over the one-step system GMM. 4 Empirical findings 4.1 Dataset, Variables, and descriptive statistics This empirical study is conducted using panel data from 24 high-tech and developed countries (i.e., Austria, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, China, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel, Iceland, Japan, the Korea Republic, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, Singapore, and the United States) and 17 years (i.e., 2005\u20132021). This follows two essential criteria: first, the countries are developed ones, having complex economies; and second, all of them occupied the first part of the Global Innovation 2022 rankings (Dutta et al., 2022), exhibiting outstanding performances in innovation. The time period covers precisely the years when interest in artificial intelligence \u201cblew up\u201d worldwide. The dependent variable as a percentage of the total labor force represents the unemployment rate, which denotes the unemployed labor force that is available for and seeking work. The interest variables capture the volume of the Google Trend Index related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Although the literature on measuring artificial intelligence is limited, GTIs could be considered a proxy for AI use. Hence, we investigate the three most popular search terms for artificial intelligence: artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. We estimate the model in three different scenarios because of the multicollinearity between these search terms: Scenario 1 - Artificial Intelligence and Unemployment; Scenario 2 - Machine Learning and Unemployment; and Scenario 3 - Data Science and Unemployment. A set of control variables is considered to isolate the effects of interest variables. They are inspired by both the theoretical model and the literature: the inflation rate, economic growth, and government spending. The economy's annual proportion of price fluctuations is reflected in the inflation rate, calculated using the consumer price index. In the theoretical literature, a negative relationship was found between inflation and unemployment (Phillips, 1958). The Phillips curve upholds stable relations for inflation and unemployment dynamics and asserts that inflation growth creates more jobs and decreases unemployment (Wulandari et al., 2019). The next control variable is GDP growth. Economic growth and the unemployment rate are the key indicators that are simultaneously monitored by both policymakers and the public, as they create a clear picture of the economic development of a country. Moreover, the linkage between the unemployment rate and economic growth as a relevant macroeconomic issue covers a wide area of theoretical and empirical research. It is a widely accepted view in economics that a higher growth rate of the GDP of an economy increases employment and reduces unemployment. This theoretical proposition relating output and unemployment is known as \u201cOkun's Law.\u201d This relationship is among the most prominent in macroeconomic theory and is held for several countries and regions, mainly in developed countries (Lee, 2000; Farsio & Quade, 2003). Government spending, which is another control variable expressed as a percentage of GDP, is cash payments for operating activities in supplying goods and services. Fiscal actions can increase labor supply and unemployment, even if output grows. Alternatively, if cuts in government purchases induce higher private-sector output and higher productivity in the private sector, GDP may grow even if unemployment increases. This ambiguity is reflected in recent research: While Monacelli et al. (2010), Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012), Ramey (2012), Holden and Sparrman (2018) conclude that an increase in government purchases leads to lower unemployment, a string of empirical studies indicates that enormous government spending will likely increase unemployment. Abrams (1999), Christopoulos et al. (2005), Feldmann (2006), Br\u00fcckner and Pappa (2012) find that increased government purchases lead to higher unemployment. As a result, the variables and their predicted signs are described in Table 1 based on empirical studies and economic literature. We investigate the rise of the Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence Google Trend Index in 24 high-tech developed countries in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 represents the trendline of GTI volumes for Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI in high-tech developed countries between 2005 and 2021. AI has an upward trend through 2018 and a slight descending trend after that, while machine learning and data science are rising from 2005 to 2019 and a slight down after that. According to GTI volumes, Machine Learning generally takes the most attention in high-tech developed countries. Artificial Intelligence and Data Science have received more searches since 2014; Machine Learning since 2012. In addition, Fig. 2 shows the share of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI GTI in high-tech developed countries in 2005\u20132021. Fig. 2(a) shows that in the 24 high-tech developed countries in 2005\u20132021, the volume of GTI for Artificial Intelligence is highest in Australia (11.2%), the US (9.8%), Canada (9.3%), the UK (9.2%), and Japan (8.4%). Fig. 2(b) shows that the volume of Data Science GTI volume is highest in the US (12.7%), Australia (11.5%), the UK (10.0%), Canada (8.8%), and Switzerland (6.3 %). In addition, according to the Machine Learning GTI, the top 5 countries are Japan (10.5%), the US (7.9%), China (7.6%), Canada (7.2%), and Switzerland (6.9%). Fig. 3 shows the correlation heatmap between all variables. Fig. 3 calculates Pearson's correlation coefficients between variables and visualizes the correlation heatmap. Especially the first column shows correlation coefficients among the dependent variable (UN), control, and interest variables. However, the other columns indicate correlation coefficients between control and interest variables. Fig. 3 shows that unemployment (UN) has a negative correlation with Inflation Rate (IR), Economic Growth (GDPGW), and the GTI volume of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science (DS), and Machine Learning(ML). Conversely, unemployment has a positive correlation with Government Size (GS). Generally, correlation heatmap indicates that the correlation between the control variables is weak, but the correlation between the GTIs is high. Hence, to improve the quality of the model and avoid multicollinearity, we include each AI, DS, and ML GTIs in the model as different scenarios, not in the same model (G\u00fcri\u015f & \u00c7a\u011flayan, 2018; Yerdelen Tato\u011flu, 2020). 4.2 Econometric model and estimation The present study investigates the artificial intelligence-unemployment nexus in high-tech developed countries. To address the research question, the dynamic panel data model is developed as in Equation (2): (2) UN i , t = \u03b1 i + \u03b2 1 UN i , t - 1 + \u03b2 2 IR i , t + \u03b2 3 GDPGW i , t + \u03b2 4 GS i , t + \u03b2 5 GTI i , t + \u03b5 i , t Where UN i , t is the unemployment rate, UN i , t - 1 is the unemployment rate for the previous year. IR i , t , GDPGW i , t , and GS i , t are control variables, and the GTI i , t is Google Trend Index with different scenarios such as Scenario 1-Artificial Intelligence, Scenario 2- Machine Learning (ML) and Scenario 3- Data Science (DS). Furthermore, 24 high-tech developed countries denote (i), 2005\u20132021 years denotes (t), constant (\u03b1i) is heterogenous across countries, coefficients (\u03b21 to \u03b25) and error term (\u03b5i,t). We adapt our econometric framework keeping in view the goal of the study and the type of data that is accessible. We use a dynamic panel model because the unemployment variable is more affected by its historical values, and we estimate the model using Blundell\u2013Bond's (1998) GMM-system two-step estimator in Table 2 . The last part of Table 2 shows diagnostic test results for the dynamic panel data model. The Sargan (1958) test of overidentifying restrictions p-values (p > 0.10) indicates that the instruments are well-identified, and overidentifying restrictions are valid in all scenarios. Arellano\u2013Bond's (1991) test for autocorrelation in first-differenced AR(2) errors p-values (p > 0.10) indicate that the residuals have no autocorrelation in order 2. The results of the Xie and Pesaran (2022) CD* cross-sectional dependence test, which is robust in weak or strong forms of cross-sectional dependency and is valid for N > T panel data, confirm that no cross-sectional dependence exists in all scenarios. As a result of diagnostic tests, all scenarios' models which use Blundell\u2013Bond's (1998) two-step GMM-system estimator are valid. In Table 2, we use Windmeijer's (2005) robust standard errors that resist finite sample correction for the variance of efficient linear two-step GMM estimators. The control and interest variables we include in the model are statistically significant, at least at the 5% level. In scenario 1, the 1% increase in unemployment in the previous year has an increasing effect on the current year's unemployment rate of 0.877%. On the other hand, a rise of 1% in the ratio of government expenditures to GDP is observed to increase unemployment by 0.08%. In contrast, a 1% increase in inflation and economic growth reduces unemployment by 0.145% and 0.159%, respectively. Scenarios 2 and 3 also yield the same outcomes with slight coefficient differences. Generally, results consider the unemployment process with \u201cmemory\u201d of the unemployment (UNi,t-1) and indicate that the process of unemployment adjustment is still rigid, with current unemployment being positively associated with the previous year's unemployment. Government Spending (GSi,t) increases the unemployment rate in all scenarios, whereas inflation rate (IRi,t) and economic growth (GDPGWi,t) decrease unemployment in 24 high-tech developed countries. Hence, Phillips's (1958) curve and Okun's (1963) law are valid in 24 high-tech developed countries. The main findings about interest variables indicate a significant negative relationship between artificial intelligence (AIi,t), Machine Learning (MLi,t), Data Science(DSi,t), and unemployment. The unemployment rate reduces by 0.003 percent as the search volume (GTIi,t) related to artificial intelligence increases in 24 high-tech developed countries (Scenario 1). In addition, the unemployment rate decreases by 0.002% when the Machine Learning (Scenario 2) and Data Science (Scenario 3) GTIs are upward. As a result, all scenarios ultimately validate the \u2018displacement effect.' New technologies such as AI, DS, and ML do not increase unemployment. On the contrary, they create new job opportunities and decrease unemployment. 5 Conclusion This study analyzes the effect of artificial intelligence on unemployment in the 24 high-tech developed countries in 2005\u20132021 using dynamic panel data estimation, which considers the dynamic lag effect of unemployment. The dynamic panel data model consists of control variables for unemployment, such as inflation, economic growth, and government spending, and interested variables, such as GTIs related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. This study tested the relationship between artificial intelligence and unemployment in three scenarios. Scenarios 1\u20133 involve GTIs associated with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. We decided to use the Blundell-Bond (1998) system's two-step GMM estimator to test all scenarios, which gives robust results when the lag of the dependent variable is contained in the dynamic panel data model. All diagnostic tests prove that the econometric model is valid, and all variables involved in the model are statistically significant at a 5% level. The negative effect of the inflation rate on unemployment is consistent with Phillips's (1958) curve in all scenarios. Okun's law also favors the inverse relationship between economic growth and unemployment in high-tech developed countries. In all scenarios, government spending is significant and negatively correlated with unemployment and results are all fully supported by Feldmann (2006), Br\u00fcckner and Pappa (2012). Our most important findings suggest a negative relationship between AI, machine learning, data science, and unemployment. As a result, the \u201cdisplacement effect\u201d is validated for artificial intelligence. Hence, AI has the potential to revolutionize the workforce by creating new job roles, automating routine tasks, and increasing productivity. AI-enabled technologies can free employees to focus on more complex and creative work requiring human skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. This can lead to a more fulfilling work experience and increased job satisfaction. Furthermore, AI can help businesses make better decisions by providing data-driven business model insights and analytics, resulting in increased profitability and growth and it can lead to the creation of new job roles and the expansion of existing ones, resulting in job creation. Ultimately, the positive impact of AI on employment is creating a more efficient, productive, and fulfilling work environment with new jobs. Regarding policy implications, if other developed and developing countries effectively provide for the application of artificial intelligence technologies and applications in economic procedures, they could decrease the unemployment rate. On the other hand, new jobs created due to AI will control the unemployment rate and help drive economic growth and competitiveness by improving efficiency. Future research can examine the relationship between artificial intelligence and unemployment using GTIs in developing countries. In addition, new control variables such as interest rates and wage rates could be added to the model and alternative econometric frameworks could be used for estimation.

Entrepreneurship and Innovation Lule\u00e5 University of Technology Sweden Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a substantial impact on firms in virtually all industries. Without guidance on how to implement and scale AI, companies will be outcompeted by the next generation of highly innovative and competitive companies that manage to incorporate AI into their operations. Research shows that competition is fierce and that there is a lack of frameworks to implement and scale AI successfully. This study begins to address this gap by providing a systematic review and analysis of different approaches by companies to using AI in their organizations. Based on these experiences, we identify key components of implementing and scaling AI in organizations and propose phases of implementing and scaling AI in firms.

For several years now, experts have expected AI to have a far-reaching impact on virtually all industries (Berg et al., 2018; Chui et al., 2018). However, this new type of AI \u2013 generative AI \u2013 is supercharging these predictions (Chui et al., 2022). Generative AI includes large language models (e.g., LLaMA, see Meta AI, 2023; GPT-3, see OpenAI and Pilipiszyn, 2021; Bard, see Pichai, 2023), image-based systems (e.g., Midjourney, see Midjourney, 2022; DALL-E, see OpenAI, 2022b; Stable Diffusion, see Stability AI, 2022), and multimodal systems that combine different types of input (e.g., GPT-4, see OpenAI, 2023) as well as application-specific systems, such as AlphaFold for protein structure prediction (Hassabis, 2022). Anyone who has experimented with these systems can quickly see that they will enable more than just efficiency and efficacy improvements for businesses; they will create the basis for powerful new capabilities for firms (Chui et al., 2022). The largest tech firms, which are pushing the development of these foundation models (The Economist, 2022), are already integrating the technology into the core of their value propositions (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2020). Many firms, however, clearly struggle to successfully implement AI. Recent surveys show that the vast majority of AI initiatives fail to take off (Browder et al., 2022; Ransbotham et al., 2020). Why is this? And how can firms gain traction with AI? To take full advantage of the potential benefits of AI technologies, firms must be able to successfully implement and ultimately scale AI in their organization. This requires going through a process of implementing and scaling AI. Firms must create the necessary prerequisites to successfully use AI technologies \u2013 that is to say, improve operational efficiency or build new value-creation capabilities based on AI technology. Without adapting to and adopting AI technologies, it will be difficult for many firms to remain competitive. Given that implementing AI technologies is a necessity to stay competitive in the long run and that most firms continue to struggle with successfully deploying AI in their organizations, a detailed analysis of how firms can approach the implementation and scaling of AI in organizations is vital. Conversely, the implementation and scaling of AI in organizations has not been studied extensively thus far (Makarius et al., 2020). Moreover, companies lack guidance in managing these processes. Specifically, companies require frameworks to support the implementation and scaling of AI (Kanioura and Lucini, 2020). This study begins to address this gap by providing a systematic analysis of firms' explanations of their approaches to using AI in their organizations. Based on these experiences, we identify the key components of AI systems in organizations, and we pinpoint the phases that firms need to go through to implement and scale AI. 2 Theoretical background 2.1 Understanding AI adoption AI, defined as \u201cthe science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs\u201d (McCarthy, 2007, p. 2), is gaining increasing relevance for firms. In particular, it is the relatively recent developments in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning \u2013 approaches \u201cconcerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience\u201d (Mitchell, 1997, p. xv) \u2013 that are driving substantial change for companies (Chui et al., 2018; Lakshmi and Bahli, 2020). Various authors have argued that the transformation toward the general use of AI in almost all company functions and areas is one of the most significant change drivers facing firms today (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020; Chalmers et al., 2021; Obschonka and Audretsch, 2020; Ransbotham et al., 2017; Zeba et al., 2021). The changes are expected to be far-reaching, touching virtually all aspects of firms' business including decision making, manufacturing, marketing, supply chain management, logistics, recruiting, and more (Holmstr\u00f6m, 2022; Makarius et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2022; Murray et al., 2021; Pachidi et al., 2021; van den Broek et al., 2021; Wang and Su, 2021). Therefore, the potential from, and perhaps even the necessity of, adopting AI technologies are, for the most part, apparent to companies. However, as with past phases when new technologies were introduced into organizations (Boothby et al., 2010), adopting AI is not as straightforward as many would hope. Very many companies struggle greatly to gain traction with AI (Browder et al., 2022; Ransbotham et al., 2020; Zolas et al., 2020). Part of the reason why firms struggle to implement AI is due to the fact that it \u201c[differs] from other advanced technologies in [its] capacity to make determinations by [itself], as well as evolve [its] determinations over time once [it is] deployed in an organization\u201d (Murray et al., 2021). This means that firms must be able to organize appropriately to ensure that the AI system can independently contribute to firm value creation as well as track and maintain these systems and their contributions to firm processes. Furthermore, other authors have pointed out that AI's myopia (Balasubramanian et al., 2022) and inability to perceive interdependencies within the firm (Raisch and Krakowski, 2021) indicate that firms will likely encounter considerable difficulty in improving firm efficiency and expanding firm value creation using AI (Kemp, 2023). Consequently, it is very important to better understand how AI implementation, and ultimately scaling, can be advanced in firms so that the considerable benefits inherent in the technology can be reaped. Research on technology adoption has pointed out that successful adoption hinges on the firm completing a transformation where it learns to both use the new technology and create the appropriate organizational setting. For instance, early studies on information technology (IT) adoption have shown that there is a \u201ccomplementarity between computer investment and organizational investment\u201d (Brynjolfsson et al., 2002, p. 138). More generally, the adoption of technology necessitates both changes in the firm's technology use itself and in its organization (Boothby et al., 2010). AI technology is often discussed as an element in digital technologies more generally. The current wave of technological changes is significantly different from previous waves of technological development. Hanelt et al. (2021) note that current technologies are in and of themselves different from past technologies, such as IT. Current digital technologies are generative, malleable, and combinatorial (Kallinikos et al., 2013). Furthermore, digital technologies are reshaping firm boundaries and evoking more fundamental change even in firms' business models (Hanelt et al., 2021). However, this literature has insufficiently examined the transformation process relating specifically to AI. Such an analysis \u2013 separate from other digital technologies, such as cloud computing \u2013 is essential because AI is effecting a fundamentally different advance for firms in \u201coffload[ing] cognitive work from humans to computers\u201d (Peretz-Andersson and Torkar, 2022, p. 2). Therefore, this paper examines the transformation of firms as they reach an initial readiness for AI and ultimately move forward to scale the use of the technology within their business. Companies that are known to be strong users of AI, such as Google and Uber, build their organizations around their AI systems (Johnson et al., 2022). Combining this practical knowledge on how AI-first firms operate with previous research on technology adoption, we seek to analyze the technological and organizational changes necessary for firms to embark on and ultimately complete the AI transformation successfully. 2.2 A socio-technical systems perspective on AI adoption Socio-technical systems theory (STST) presents a very suitable framework for analyzing the implementation and scaling of AI in organizations because it has been used to study technology adoption more generally. It has been employed in different contexts including advanced manufacturing (Shani et al., 1992), renewable energy (Li et al., 2015; Yun and Lee, 2015), shipping (Geels, 2002), and mobile communications (Ansari and Garud, 2009; Shin et al., 2011). STST adopts a systems view of organizations \u2013 that is to say, it views any organization, or part of it, as consisting of a set of interacting sub-systems (Appelbaum, 1997; Geels, 2004). The theory is based on the socio-technical model developed by Leavitt (1965), whose original conceptualization proposed four interrelated and coordinated dimensions \u2013 namely, people, task, structure, and technologies \u2013 as the core components of organizational work systems. More recent work in the area of STST has tended to focus on a six-dimensional conceptualization consisting of people, goals, culture, infrastructure, technology, and processes (see e.g., M\u00fcnch et al., 2022; Sony and Naik, 2020). Moreover, the external environment with the firm's stakeholders and general market environment are often studied as part of STST (M\u00fcnch et al., 2022). STST is a suitable theoretical framework for our analysis of AI implementation and scaling in firms for several reasons. Our introduction to STST above shows that the theory presents a comprehensive framework to analyze emerging phenomena with interconnected technical and social dimensions. Critically, AI systems contain both technical and social aspects (Anthony et al., 2023; Glikson and Woolley, 2020; Lebovitz et al., 2022; Makarius et al., 2020). Therefore, STST is a highly appropriate framework to study AI implementation and scaling. Prior research in related areas such as servitization has shown that the joint study of social and technical components is beneficial in understanding the adoption and success of digital technologies (M\u00fcnch et al., 2022; Sony and Naik, 2020). Studies examining social and technical aspects of artificial intelligence specifically are, however, still very rare. The exceptions include Chowdhury et al. (2022) and Anthony (2021) who both examined socio-technical factors affecting individual employees' collaboration with and use of AI. Xing et al. (2021) studied socio-technical barriers to the adoption of AI-based products by consumers. The only study to consider firm-level socio-technical aspects is Makarius et al. (2020), which proposes that the scope and novelty level of AI are key criteria in defining the approach to AI implementation. However, Makarius and colleagues note that \u201cthe fundamental issues related to structure and functioning in organizations in relation to AI systems remain underexplored\u201d (Makarius et al., 2020, p. 271). Consequently, the goal of our research is to begin to address this precise gap in the literature by studying the process followed by companies in implementing and scaling AI in their organizations as well as the socio-technical components involved in this process. 3 Data and methods We take an exploratory case study approach to examine the phases of implementing and scaling AI in a range of different companies. We rely on techniques for inductive theory building (Eisenhardt et al., 2016; Gehman et al., 2018). We base our approach to sample selection on that employed by Fisher et al. (2020), which uses podcasts featuring expert interviews as a data source. In our study, we used interviews conducted as part of the TWIML AI podcast (originally This Week in Machine Learning and AI), which is one of the top podcasts on artificial intelligence (Charrington, 2022). The podcast includes interviews with some of the top minds and ideas in machine learning and AI with the goal of elucidating the impact of AI on how businesses operate. The podcast guests include a wide range of machine learning and AI researchers, practitioners, and innovators. We analyzed podcast episodes that fulfilled the following criteria: \u2022 The podcast featured a guest from industry practice rather than a researcher. This ensured that guests would be able to speak specifically to their experience with implementing and scaling AI applications in their respective firms. \u2022 We selected a diverse set of firms that included both companies that are widely known to be among the most advanced in applying AI in their organizations and those that have relatively less experience. In doing so, we can capture a broader range of industry experience, with AI technologies applied in different settings. \u2022 We included a wide variety of AI application areas from computer vision to sales forecasting, to content moderation. This approach allows us to derive more generally applicable approaches to using AI in organizations that go beyond the specifics related to particular AI technologies. The firms analyzed in this study are all active in applying AI technologies. Importantly, they are in different phases of implementing and scaling AI (Table 1 ). Some interviewees have worked in more than one organization, allowing them to compare and contrast different approaches based on their varied personal experience. These cases represent real-life experience in applying AI technologies and managing the phases of implementing and scaling AI in different organizational contexts. Moreover, the interviewees provide some indication of what, in their experience, may constitute some of the best practices for implementing and scaling AI. The study examines all interviews conducted with AI practitioners featured on the TWIML AI podcast between May 2021 and November 2022. The podcasts were analyzed regarding descriptions provided by practitioners on how they implemented AI technologies in their firms. We were intentionally broad in our initial analysis, including various types of information on using AI in firms without focusing on any specific aspect. We made notes on how experienced various practitioners and their companies were in applying AI technologies. This allowed us to determine how firms tend to progress through the phases of implementing and scaling AI. Overall, we examined 22 interviews with machine learning and AI practitioners. Some interviewees providing insights into work both at their current firm and at well-known AI-first companies, such as Google, Uber, and Netflix, where they held prior positions. The practitioners held various positions including chief executive officer, chief data officer, head of AI, head of data science, and machine learning engineer. All interviewees had experience applying AI technologies in businesses and were, therefore, able to provide insights into the approaches chosen at their respective firms. Our analysis of the interviews focused on recognizing key activities in AI implementation and scaling across the firms included in our study. We systematically uncovered themes in our complex data using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). This involved coding and categorizing phrases and themes mentioned by interviewees in the podcast episodes. This approach allowed us to identify various factors relevant to implementing and scaling AI in organizations. Subsequently, we examined the factors to identify underlying aggregate patterns. Finally, we mapped links between the aggregate patterns to derive a structured maturity model. 4 Findings This section presents the findings from our analysis of the interviews with machine learning and AI professionals. Section 4.1 describes the sub-dimensions of the socio-technical system for AI implementation and scaling. Then, Section 4.2 delineates how the socio-technical system is designed to accommodate firms initially implementing AI and ultimately scaling AI in their organizations. 4.1 Components of implementing and scaling AI Implementing and scaling new technologies is a complex endeavor for firms (Fountaine et al., 2021). Recognizing which levers exist for management to successfully implement these technologies is, therefore, extremely important. Our analysis of the interviews in our study allowed us to determine the most important components outlined by the interviewees that increase the likelihood of successful implementation and scaling of AI in firms. We therefore employed an inductive approach to derive the key technical and social components involved in implementing and scaling AI in firms. In the following section, we briefly elaborate on the dimensions, elucidating the main sub-dimensions of the technical and social components. 4.1.1 Technical components Managing the technology itself is clearly one of the most important aspects of implementing and scaling AI in organizations. Our analyses show that there are three levers within the technical components category. First, the data pipeline presents an intuitively important aspect. Many organizations struggle with collecting and maintaining the data necessary to fully implement and scale AI. Managing data is, therefore, an important aspect of enabling the implementation and scaling of AI. Second, the technical infrastructure refers to how and where AI systems are developed in organizations. There are different choices that firms can make in this area with implications for how well these AI systems can be scaled. Third, AI models indicate the types of algorithmic approach used by firms when developing their AI systems. These approaches can range from relatively simple traditional machine learning approaches to ensembles of highly sophisticated deep learning-based systems. 4.1.2 Social components The other key dimension of successfully implementing and scaling AI in organizations involves setting the right social context. Here too, we see three important sub-dimensions of components. First, the AI growth vision refers to the overall goal set by the organization regarding using AI in the company. The vision sets the scope for choices taken within the other dimensions and sub-dimensions. Second, AI capabilities are key in successfully driving AI projects. Firms must bring together both technical and domain capabilities. Third, the AI organizational structure relates to the organizational design of the AI team and its responsibilities within the firm. Depending on the vision and the phase of implementing and scaling AI in the company, different approaches will be chosen. These components describe the main levers available to firms attempting to implement and scale AI in their organizations. Our analysis shows that firms can develop different approaches to implementing and scaling AI along these technical and social dimensions. 4.2 Implementing and scaling AI in organizations To successfully use AI, companies need to overcome certain hurdles and develop essential internal capabilities. We used the insights gleaned from machine learning and AI professionals at various companies to first determine the key socio-technical components required to implement and scale AI in firms. Next, we analyzed which capabilities these firms developed to overcome the hurdles identified and to successfully use AI in their respective firms. This analysis of the interviews with machine learning and AI practitioners indicated that there were two main areas requiring development in firms to successfully use AI: Develop the necessary technical infrastructure: Key technical developments are an important foundational driver for successful use of AI in companies. These requisite technical developments are closely related to the technical requirements of AI systems themselves. At a most basic level, training an AI system involves combining the following assets: collecting and managing data pipeline for training and validation, providing the necessary technical infrastructure to carry out the training and keep track of the deployed AI systems and, finally, hosting and maintaining a set of AI models used in the systems. Across these areas, firms have a variety of choices to make \u2013 for example, whether they make or buy certain stacks, or how to design the various elements modularly and flexibly. Create the right social context: Having a suitable organizational setting within which to develop AI solutions is very important to successfully implement and scale AI in firms. First, organizations need to have an appropriate guiding AI growth vision that sets the scope and direction for AI implementation and scaling. Next, organizations must develop a range of AI capabilities that allow the firm to harness the potential of AI. This means building up both technical and domain capabilities. Often firms can supplement their internal capabilities with those offered by external partners to speed up the implementation and scaling of AI. Finally, firms need to set up the organizational structure. To successfully navigate AI implementation and scaling, firms need to combine the technical and business domain expertise needed to develop AI solutions and drive value creation for the business. Our analyses of the interviews with machine learning and AI experts showed that there are various key activities in these two areas \u2013 technical and social components \u2013 supporting the implementation and scaling of AI in firms. We categorized the key activities according to different maturity levels to define the phases of AI implementation and scaling in firms (Table 2 ). 4.2.1 Level 1. Proving the concept The first phase of implementing and scaling AI emphasizes the firm familiarizing itself with the potential of AI technologies and popularizing these within the organization. At this stage, firms can often rely on external support to implement initial AI solutions that clearly demonstrate the added value for the business. Technical components: Our analyses show that, in this important first phase of implementing and scaling AI, creating a first data pipeline is highly important. This means starting to eliminate data silos and ensuring that the data infrastructure is ready for the next phases of implementing and scaling AI. Mike del Balso from Tecton/Uber noted: \u201cA big challenge that a lot of these companies have is that they're still not kind of at \u2018data maturity,\u2019 so then building \u2018ML maturity\u2019 on top of that is a tricky spot to be in.\u201d Without the necessary data pipeline maturity, therefore, the next phases will become significantly more difficult to reach. Meanwhile, the approach to technical infrastructure can remain relatively simple in this first phase of implementing AI. Proof-of-concept AI applications can be developed on relatively modest infrastructure that is available to most firms. For example, Heather Nolis explained that T-Mobile started out with very rudimentary technical infrastructure: \u201cWe originally released our models in R. It was just R in a Docker container as an API. They ran pretty okay. We were doing two million returns a day.\u201d Many firms also avail themselves of externally available services as offered, for example, by the large cloud providers. Daan Odijk from RTL described the advantages of using externally available services thus: \u201cBy taking these off-the-shelf models and then putting our own intelligence in the second level, our own labeling and where we have the data in that second level, that made a lot more sense for this learning problem as well.\u201d The latter has the advantage of allowing your AI teams to scale their systems more quickly in the future. Regarding AI model development, most machine learning and AI practitioners recommend starting with the easiest and simplest models possible. Errol Koolmeister describes the lessons learned in this regard at H&M: \u201cWhen we started out and some of the consultancy early use cases and some of our early use cases, many of the people in the teams threw themselves directly into the latest research, wanted to do neural networks, wanted to get just a 0.1 uplift. But what we realized as well is that this isn't a Kaggle competition, it is not about optimizing the metrics and that, then you're done. It's about carrying it over into production into the infrastructure as well.\u201d Beyond relying on simpler models to achieve quicker gains, our analysis revealed that cloud providers often have services that allow firms to build their own applications based on existing models. Heather Nolis from T-Mobile recounted their own initial forays into model development: \u201cI can speak about our speech-to-text here where we originally did roll out with vendor partners. We did a huge RFP (request for proposal). Every major speech-to-text provider in the world that exists, I have reviewed them. We launched our original proof of concept with AWS Transcribe. We did use a vendor. But immediately, once we had the audio data, we started looking at open source solutions and saying what can we do on our specific data.\u201d This quotation touches on important learning regarding AI models, which is that firms should try to take advantage of the many open-source options available. Social components: At the social level, the first phase of implementing AI requires the creation of an AI growth vision that focuses on identifying and successfully pursuing both valuable and feasible proofs of concept. To a certain extent, this allows firms to \u201cpick the low hanging fruit\u201d early on, which clearly demonstrates the potential benefits of AI technologies to a wide range of firm stakeholders, thereby improving company-wide buy-in. For example, Nishan Subedi from Overstock argued that \u201cmachine learning is, I think, best handled when there's at least clarity in terms of the objectives you want to achieve.\u201d At T-Mobile, meanwhile, Heather Nolis saw that it was important to \u201cdrive home a culture of small models for small problems. Build things specific for your use case to answer it exactly. Otherwise, you will get a deteriorated product.\u201d In terms of AI capabilities, firms need to begin building their technical capabilities so that the first AI applications can be successfully implemented. Often, it can be a good tactic to look to external expertise \u2013 for example, from consulting companies or large cloud providers to help kick-start such early proofs of concept. Antje Barth from AWS explained the advantages of using Amazon SageMaker: \u201cThere have been a lot of additions to this managed service that is giving you basically the tools to build, to train, and to deploy models easily. At the same time, it's taking care of the infrastructure for you. It does the heavy lifting of managing individual instances. You can really focus on your tasks: to build models, to train the models, and to deploy them.\u201d Importantly, the firm should begin to create the right organizational structure. In this phase, this means starting to build a central AI team. This will allow the firm to begin focusing on and developing its AI capabilities. Errol Koolmeister explains that: \u201cthe H&M approach was to do it centrally from the start basically to incubate the capability rather to spread it out.\u201d The organizational structure should enable good collaboration between the AI experts responsible for the technical implementation and the business domain experts who will be able to scope the various AI projects so that they can create real value for the organization. 4.2.2 Level 2. Productionizing The second phase presents a relatively large leap forward in terms of the impact of implementing and scaling AI. At this stage, firms must set up the necessary technical and social components to allow AI systems to work in production, meaning that these systems are running and supporting a wide variety of business processes. The systems are being tracked and continuously updated while they provide a very large number of (real-time) inferences and predictions. Technical components: In the second phase of implementing and scaling AI, it is important to have a data pipeline that is well organized so that it can be easily re-used in the future. Often, firms will optimize re-usability by storing processed data that can then be reapplied in many use cases across the business as well as in possible new applications. Kim Branson from GSK noted that it is important to: \u201cbuild data for future you so you can use it again. Collect those other data points at additional marginal cost that are really useful.\u201d Srivathsan Canchi from Intuit underlined this point: \u201cAs we were building ML models for servicing these different systems, we were discovering that we are building similar features because the data sets are highly intersecting. We have a lot of features that need to go across these systems and be shared between models; across turbo tax, quickbooks, and mint. To be effective at sharing such features, we needed a way to do that.\u201d Moreover, the analysis revealed another important aspect regarding the data pipeline that firms faced during the \u201cproductionizing\u201d phase. Specifically, the need to manage data access and ensure compliance increases during this phase. Subarna Sinha from 23andMe noted her company's complex requirements in this regard: \u201cWe need to make sure that we are satisfying research compliance. Then, we are also GDPR CCPA compliant. We have to have all of our training data... Even though we save our training data for a little bit, it expires. We have to have processes in place to destroy those buckets at a regular frequency and regenerate all of the training data as needed. The exact requirements regarding data access and compliance vary by industry. Those companies operating in highly regulated industries, such as 23andMe, or those involving specific customers, such as children, must be able to address these issues very conscientiously in the \u201cproductionizing\u201d phase. The technical infrastructure is perhaps the most important pillar of the second phase of implementing and scaling AI. It must integrate all relevant components of AI systems from data management to experiment management, to orchestration and deployment management. In this phase, firms can develop both new AI systems and continuously run systems in production. A standardized infrastructure is the backbone enabling this dual exploration and exploitation in AI systems. Errol Koolmeister explains that H&M sees: \u201cenormous productivity gain with designing an infrastructure that's reusable rather than building independent use cases at this scale.\u201d Firms need a deep understanding of the processes involved in developing AI systems, which allows them to standardize and automate many of the processes. Sushil Thomas from Cloudera explains that productionizing AI systems differs markedly from traditional web development: \u201cI think another challenge is just trying to understand what's different between that standard web app sort of development and product development versus like a ML/AI model going into production because there are large substantial differences that are really important to internalize and understand so that you can focus on different aspects of it as well.\u201d In order to make broad use of AI across the organization, a solid technical infrastructure backbone is necessary. According to Akshat Kaul from Redfin, building sound technological infrastructure is key to using AI in different areas of the company: \u201cWhat we've been trying to do more recently is really develop that infrastructure, make it standardized, make it easy to use, really democratize machine learning within the company, and allow people teams across the business, across different domains to hire people who have that machine learning talent or to grow that talent and then use the platform that this team has built to tackle use cases in different domains.\u201d Interestingly, machine learning and AI practitioners mention that it can be very helpful to be technologically agnostic and to retain a certain level of flexibility in the exact infrastructure choice \u2013 for example, regarding which cloud provider the firm chooses. This enables firms to be able to switch to better options as they become available, which is highly important in a field such as AI where many of the tools and services are still developing and improving on a regular basis. Ya Xu from Linkedin notes: \u201cFrom [a] platform architecture standpoint, always think about how to build a platform in an extensible way.\u201d Jake Berkowitz points out why maintaining flexibility is necessary: \u201cThe one thing you know about technology, somebody's going to come along with a better mousetrap. You need to be ready to re-architect and refactor. We think about it architecturally. We budget time for that as we go. It's the reality of the cloud.\u201d Some companies such as GSK, have further, more specific criteria to build out their technical infrastructure. Kim Branson explains that: \u201cthe compute is really important for us. It's key to be unconstrained by compute.\u201d Such specific aspects will depend heavily on the use cases pursued by the particular company, but they should also be considered in developing the technical infrastructure. In the \u201cproductionizing\u201d phase of implementing and scaling AI, firms can speed up experimentation on new models as well as continuously improve existing AI models. Akshat Kaul from Redfin explains: \u201cIt's an ongoing effort. We are always working on improving the model that we have in production.\u201d Importantly, firms can often productionize their AI particularly well when they place the emphasis on simpler rather than more complex models. For instance, Errol Koolmeister from H&M recommends: \u201cYou don't go with the most complex technology or algorithm from the start because you don't know how that will scale.\u201d Combined with the ability to continuously improve models, the upshot is more reliable models overall. This aspect of the \u201cproductionizing\u201d phase is especially relevant for a company such as ADP. Jack Berkowitz illustrates this point: \u201cThe second thing is about reliability because we're messing with people's paychecks at the end of the day. That's what we do. That's the most personal data there is other than maybe healthcare data. If you want to see somebody get excited, make a mistake on their paycheck. So, we have to have a little bit of reliability in terms of what we're doing.\u201d Reliability is evidently an important aspect to productionizing AI systems because companies increasingly need to make sure their AI systems provide accurate predictions and generate plausible output. Similarly, they need to be able to keep track of the consistency of their AI systems. Social components: In this phase of implementing and scaling AI, the AI growth vision changes to target the application of AI across the value chain and throughout the entire organization. Kevin Stumpf describes the varied application areas for AI at Uber: \u201cThe use cases really varied from everything from supporting self-driving cars to dynamic pricing predictions to fraud detection, customer support, rider and order ETAs, restaurant recommendations.\u201d A key feature can be to prioritize the time to customer value creation, i.e., focusing on those applications and use cases where the organization can create real value for customers in a short time frame. Subarna Sinha describes how productionizing AI at 23andMe helped to change the growth vision for AI at the company: \u201cI think when you see something happen this quickly and you're able to say \u2018Oh I just want to train this and see what the results look like even if I'm not going to ship it to customers tomorrow.\u2019 It changes people... It's a delta, kind of a big shift in the way people think about it.\u201d At this stage, it is important to focus on one key AI capability, which is speed. This involves ensuring that the organization can quickly experiment with new AI applications and test their performance in production. Adrien Gaidon explains how Toyota approaches this aspect of the \u201cproductionizing\u201d phase: \u201cYou want faster turnaround time and this kind of stuff. We want to create some kind of Toyota production system of deep learning. It's so that we can iterate really quickly from idea to model to validation and go back to the drawing board.\u201d Machine learning and AI practitioners often work in agile ways, completing projects in sprints. This approach is even adopted by heavily research-oriented firms where the traditional pace is slower, and the development roadmap is oriented much more to the long term. For example, Kim Branson mentions that his company, GSK, \u201cworks in two-week sprints.\u201d Developing the capability to quickly iterate ideas and products is important to satisfy customer requirements as well. A strong centrally positioned organizational structure can be a key component to transition to the second phase of implementing and scaling AI. Many companies focus on building a core AI team to support the various AI initiatives in the firm. Companies sometimes rely on additional vertical teams that closely support a particular line of business and help to solve problems specific to AI implementation in that line of business. Sushil Thomas from Cloudera explains: \u201cThere are people who have a hub-and-spoke model where they have a central sort of center of excellence with the these are the guys who set up the best practices around the technologies they use and deployment practices and stuff like that. Then business units will have their own individual data scientists that they work with for their actual use cases.\u201d As part of the organizational structure for the \u201cproductionizing\u201d phase, it can be helpful to have key team members who evangelize for AI in the organization. These team members help to bring the AI growth vision to the entire organization. Ya Xu explains her approach at LinkedIn: \u201cThe way that I also see that's worked really well is having this model that I like to call the champion model. Let's say for example you build a platform and you have to convince ten other teams to use it. Don't say hey all of you guys come and use my thing, but start with a couple of them who are already leaning in. They already showed interest, they already are actually excited about this thing.\u201d Positioning champions for AI in the organizational structure can, therefore, be a very effective way to drive broad adoption of AI in the firm. 4.2.3 Level 3. Platformizing The third phase of AI implementation allows firms to truly scale their AI systems. In \u201cplatformizing\u201d AI in their organizations, businesses can take advantage of size, reusing capabilities in different contexts to fully ramp up AI in the organization. Technical components: In this phase of scaling AI, firms rely very heavily on the previously established data pipeline and technical infrastructure approaches. To fully scale AI in the organization, both data management and infrastructure need to be optimized for latency and throughput. In this phase, AI systems must often make lightning-fast inferences and process vast amounts of data in real time. Indeed, during the \u201cplatformized\u201d phase, companies often have to plan quite methodically for limitations in terms of inference speed and computing power. Ali Rodell points out how Capital One walks this tightrope: \u201cA lot of people think that compute is unlimited because we work in the public cloud. Everybody reads compute is infinite in the cloud. One of the things we try and do is make sure that people understand that it is not. It is very scalable, but it is not unlimited.\u201d The infrastructure should generally continue to improve in this phase to consider and eliminate any pain points encountered in running existing AI systems. To fully scale AI, it is helpful to democratize access to data and infrastructure so that AI solutions can be developed more quickly and by stakeholders with relatively less technical expertise. Kevin Stumpf from Tecton/Uber notes that: \u201cThe more data scientists you have, the more different use cases you have, the more sharing becomes a big part of it.\u201d Subarna Sinha shares the future potential she sees to expand AI at 23andMe: \u201cThe way we look at it, we feel we're really at kind of the beginning of what machine learning can do in terms of giving information on health. Right now a lot of our models primarily incorporate genetic information but there is room for incorporating information from wearables, information from lab values that you have, like your blood report or some measure of some other reports that you can have.\u201d The most important technical component in the third phase of scaling AI is the way AI models are developed at this stage. Specifically, firms in this phase start to rely heavily on reusing capabilities. This means that they tend to develop \u201cplatforms\u201d for related models. For instance, many firms find that forecasting is a problem that is highly relevant to many different business areas. At LinkedIn, such AI-based capabilities are re-used strategically, as described by Ya Xu: \u201cI know that you are quite familiar with our proML platform. You can actually build your modules on top of it. [...] A simple example is my team actually developed this model [for] explainability capability. They used it in their application. That went really well. They built it as an extensible module on the platform so other people who wanted to use it they can use it too.\u201d In the \u201cplatformizing\u2019 phase of scaling AI, firms focus on building models that often open up the possibility of looking at a broader spectrum of related problems. Forecasting models, for instance, are germane to general time series problems, which can be applied in various company areas. Social components: At the organizational level, the AI growth vision should now focus on the long-term strategy for AI to enable data-driven innovation in the organization. Targeted use cases should now consider reusability and applicability to multiple lines of business. Moreover, firms should consider where to strategically invest in capabilities that will likely become highly relevant for the business within the next few years. Parvez Ahammad from LinkedIn explains how the company thinks about this issue: \u201cThere are two investment pillars that I mentally use. One is how do we pick problems that, essentially, if we solve them very well, help multiple lines of businesses? Take, for example, something like doing a really good job on experimentation, helps multiple lines of businesses evaluate how their products are working. [It] helps them iteratively ship the products better. Something like forecasting, if you do a really good job, it also allows multiple businesses to have an ability to set their goals and actually measure how things are going and recognize when things are not going right. The utility across multiple lines of business is a key pillar for how we think about it. The second important pillar is what is the strategic scope or impact? On this pillar, it doesn't need to be actually a native part of the products today but something that we believe is going to be really important for us to invest in.\u201d In terms of the AI capabilities required for this phase of scaling AI, here too, we see that firms are changing their emphasis from vertical capabilities specialized in business lines or functions to horizontal capabilities that can scale across business lines and functions. Sushil Thomas from Cloudera explains very succinctly that: \u201cit's important to just up-level org-wide what you can do with all of your data.\u201d Capabilities should be managed as a portfolio with an eye to balancing shorter-term capability development and more risky, longer-term capability development. According to Parvez Ahammad, LinkedIn wants \u201cto be able to start new things or drop things that aren't working and be much more driven by market fit within the LinkedIn ecosystem.\u201d By strategically managing a portfolio of different AI projects, firms are able to exploit current capabilities while crafting space to create new ones. To support the vision and capability development, firms in this phase of scaling AI often alter the organizational structure. Horizontal teams that work on overarching capabilities such as forecasting are required to fully scale AI platforms. These teams can have a more (applied) research focus to drive horizontal capabilities more effectively. Errol Koolmeister from H&M explains what the implications of the company's plans to scale AI are: \u201cIf we are 100 people today or 120-ish working on the AI use cases, we have around 10 use cases in production right now, if we're going to have all our core operational decisions amplified by AI by 2025, which is our tech leap that we're aiming towards, we're going to need thousands of people if we're scaling it vertically.\u201d LinkedIn already operates its AI systems on a massive scale. Consequently, they have adapted their organizational structure to be able to effectively support the demands of these AI systems. Parvez Ahammad describes the teams at LinkedIn: \u201cOne of the things that is relatively new... couple of years ago we started these horizontal teams. There are at least a couple of them. One of them is called Data Science Applied Research, which is my team. There is a sister team that we have called Data Science Productivity and Experimentation.\u201d LinkedIn has created a new organizational structure for AI at scale, which allows it to capitalize on the idea of reusable capabilities. The company achieved this by building teams on overarching topics such as applied research and experimentation. This setup allows LinkedIn to drive these topics across business units and application areas. 5 Discussion 5.1 Theoretical and management implications The literature has repeatedly highlighted the potential of AI to dramatically increase firm performance, regardless of industry (Berg et al., 2018; Chui et al., 2018; Makarius et al., 2020). Some researchers have argued that the largest technology firms in particular have built a sustainable competitive advantage by shoring up their AI capabilities in digital platforms (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2020). At the same time, many other firms struggle to reap the rewards from AI (Browder et al., 2022; Ransbotham et al., 2020). This poses an interesting question of why some firms succeed while others fail to benefit from AI. Currently, pressure is increasing due to the rapid change induced by ChatGPT and other generative AI systems, which are substantially changing how businesses should be conducted in most industries (Edelman and Abraham, 2023). Even though experts have long predicted that AI will change the competitive arena and how to act in virtually all industries (Berg et al., 2018; Chui et al., 2018), this is now happening fast, and many firms are rapidly working on how best to implement and scale AI in their business. In reviewing how companies are coping with these challenges, we believe we are making several contributions to the research in this field. Past work on technology adoption has shown that successful implementation centers on firms creating an appropriate socio-technical system within which to foster the new technology. This has been shown to be the case for IT adoption, for instance (Boothby et al., 2010; Brynjolfsson et al., 2002). Several studies indicate that AI technology contains socio-technical components that firms must manage in order to benefit from it (Anthony et al., 2023; Glikson and Woolley, 2020; Lebovitz et al., 2022; Makarius et al., 2020). Given that AI is generative, malleable, and combinatorial (Kallinikos et al., 2013), and that it can autonomously make predictions or generate outcomes and advance these over time (Murray et al., 2021), firms are faced with sizeable challenges in creating a suitable socio-technical system to benefit from the technology. However, research on the socio-technical components required to successfully exploit \u2013 that is to say, implement and scale \u2013 AI is still very limited, and there have been calls for further research in this area (Kanioura and Lucini, 2020; Makarius et al., 2020). The primary contribution of our study, therefore, is to begin to address this gap in the literature. Our exploratory qualitative approach allows us to gain a more fine-grained understanding of the socio-technical components of implementing and scaling AI. Specifically, we find that, on the technical side, firms should build out their data pipelines, technical infrastructure, and AI models. On the social side, firms should create an AI growth vision, build AI capabilities, and create an organizational structure to support the development of AI systems. We further contribute to the literature by describing the phases of AI implementation and scaling. We find that the above socio-technical components play different roles during the process of moving from implementing to scaling AI. Firms generally begin with \u201cproving the concept\u201d of AI within the firm by launching their first viable use cases of the technology. Then, as firms plan to use AI more systematically, they advance to the \u201cproductionizing\u201d phase. This phase is characterized by an increased standardization of processes to enable firms to handle more use cases. Finally, firms reach the \u201cplatformizing\u201d phase, which allows them to run AI at scale. This means that they address use cases across the entire value chain, setting up the appropriate socio-technical components to reuse capabilities across AI applications. Moreover, this study contributes to our understanding of how companies should act specifically when facing AI in their markets. We identify four basic advantages of implementing and scaling AI. First, implementing and scaling AI is considered a strategic necessity for most industrial sectors. As Nir Bar-Lev, the CEO of Clear ML, notes: \u201cYou probably want to have data scientists because if you want to be competitive, in virtually every industry today, you have to integrate AI into your business\u201d. This assertion is strongly supported by recent research on the applicability of AI, which indicates that AI can be employed in almost any sector (Chui et al., 2018). Consequently, at a most basic level, taking small steps to investigate how to implement and scale AI is a prerequisite for firms to remain competitive in the market. Firms that do not adopt AI risk being left behind. Second, successfully implementing and, in particular, scaling AI are necessary for firms to fully realize the financial benefits that the technology can offer. Firms at the very early stages of AI implementation often struggle to do so (Ransbotham et al., 2020). These firms are seemingly stuck in proof-of-concept purgatory. The transition to productionized or platformized AI is difficult. Nir Bar-Lev explains how difficult it was for AI powerhouse, Google, to accomplish the transition only a few years ago when it worked to productionize an AI system that could help the company improve electrical consumption in its data centers by 40 % (Evans and Gao, 2016): \u201cThat got a lot of attention, but what wasn't known outside was that building that initial model took three weeks. Building a prototype to check it out, just validate it in one data center \u2013 not a working product, but a prototype \u2013 took three months. Rolling it out as a product? Over a year.\u201d Since there is still a considerable hurdle for firms to surmount in employing AI profitably, it is important to address this question (Browder et al., 2022). Bringing AI fully into the production environment allows firms to reap the financial benefits from these systems. This study furthers our understanding by identifying the key socio-technical components that firms scaling AI need to employ in their organizations. Third, our study shows that productionizing and platformizing increase the speed, reliability, and explainability of AI systems. By standardizing and automating many of the core functions in AI systems, productionizing and platformizing improve the efficiency of AI. Jack Berkowitz, chief data officer at ADP, describes the main advantages his company sees in productionizing AI: \u201cThe first one is about pace. The world's busy, clients are demanding, and the world situations are changing all the time. The second thing is about reliability [\u2026] the third thing is really about clarity and explainability, whether it's to each other inside the development teams or whether it's to our end clients.\u201d By offering a systematic approach to AI development, productionizing creates the foundation for measurable and benchmarkable success. Such features are highly important because AI systems are often biased and it is, therefore, important to ensure that the systems run as intended and can be managed appropriately. This is perhaps especially true for generative AI systems that are prone to creating unreliable output. Consequently, firms should create the best possible socio-technical system to support their AI endeavors (Jackson, 2023). Finally, our study indicates that platformizing AI enables entirely new opportunities for firms. This phase of scaling AI means that businesses can pursue novel data-driven innovation. The advanced techniques and reuse of capabilities create space for the firm to discover new prospects. Parvez Ahammad, head of data science applied research at LinkedIn, explains how working on one reusable capability has opened new paths for the company: \u201cOne of the nice side effects of getting the forecasting part right has been that we now are starting to look at a broader spectrum of time series problems. Forecasting is a sister problem to anomaly detection. Most people that come to you and ask for forecasting or anomaly detection also want a root cause analysis. There are a lot of statistical problems that are very adjacent. Initially, we were very focused on one, and when we got it right we feel like we have a p(0) answer. We are trying to slowly build something that's more holistic.\u201d Ultimately, the team thinks these developments will allow it to \u201cchange the culture of performance management [and make forecasting] a much more natural component of how people do matrix performance management.\u201d This example nicely illustrates how entirely new possibilities can be shaped by platformizing AI in organizations. In this phase, the potential is diverse, and firms will be able to create new data-driven initiatives supported by AI-based capabilities. This finding of our study is of particular interest for the AI literature on innovation and management because it indicates that AI may be a key way for firms to create capabilities going forward (Kemp, 2023). Our study is, therefore, among the first to show which socio-technical components are pertinent in creating AI-based capabilities and how firms can navigate the process of gaining competitive advantage using AI capabilities. These benefits are findings uncovered from our analysis of the early stages. The full effects of scaling AI are presumably even more extensive. As noted, the implementation and scaling of AI in organizations is predicted to bring wide-ranging changes in essentially all sectors of industry and will substantially contribute to economic growth (Bughin et al., 2018; Chui et al., 2018). To fully take advantage of the potential benefits of AI, managers must pull the right socio-technical levers in their organizations. They need to develop the right technical and social components for AI. 5.2 Limitations and paths for future research This study has some important limitations that, at the same time, point to certain interesting paths for future research. First and foremost, as a purely qualitative study, generalizability from our findings is somewhat limited. It would be a very worthwhile endeavor for future research to quantitatively examine the implementation and scaling of AI in organizations. In particular, it would be interesting for scholars to examine the extent to which employee knowledge and skills impact firms' ability to implement and scale AI because these factors are of considerable importance for firms attempting to benefit fully from modern technologies (Zheng and Hu, 2008). Relatedly, future work could consider studying how firms' plans to implement and scale AI interact with other firm strategies. For example, recent research has shown that some firm strategies are more conducive to good performance in turbulent market conditions (Beliaeva et al., 2020). Consequently, it may be fruitful to examine how other firm strategies support or impede technology adoption in firms. Second, the literature on digital transformation, which is broader than AI transformation specifically, suggests that the external context can markedly influence the extent to which firms can and must transform (Hanelt et al., 2021). In line with this research, it may be helpful for future research to consider additional external conditions affecting firms' AI transformations. Future research may also benefit from analyzing the larger labor market implications of increased AI implementation and scaling. Past research has indicated that adoption of AI and robotics can have a significant impact on the labor market (Autor, 2015; Chen et al., 2022; Dixon et al., 2021). Since the implications of AI adoption are still ambiguous, with some studies suggesting that increased use of the technology will lead to lower employment and others arguing the opposite, it would be beneficial for future work to examine whether the AI transformation approach chosen by companies affects AI's impact on employees. Finally, the current study did not limit itself in terms of industry, firm size, or geographical location. Future work could, therefore, examine how AI transformation is affected by the industry context, firm size, and sector location. Such analyses would allow the literature to establish more generalizable findings that hold across industry, firm size, and geography as well as to determine specific findings for smaller sets operating under special conditions. 6 Conclusion The rapid advancement of AI presents significant challenges for companies, requiring them to adapt and navigate in order to integrate AI into their operations. To stay competitive, companies must proactively engage with AI technologies, strategically invest in talent and infrastructure, and establish a comprehensive AI framework to drive innovation and shape industry standards. This paper has argued that knowledge of AI implementation and scaling is rapidly needed and that it is time to review best practice. Our effort provides an initial framework and scientific model of AI implementation and AI scaling. Developing and implementing AI is known to be a difficult and challenging undertaking, but our accounts provide a list of benefits. Companies that succeed in implementing and scaling AI can ensure they remain competitive, drive value creation across the value chain, unlock efficient, reliable, and explainable AI solutions, and develop new AI-based capabilities. Success hinges on managing the implementation and scaling of AI by pulling the right socio-technical levers \u2013 developing a data pipeline, technical infrastructure, and AI models \u2013 while setting the right social context of laying out the AI growth vision, expanding AI capabilities, and establishing a suitable organizational structure. The framework we provide in this paper offers guidance on how to implement and scale AI to facilitate the successful use of AI in companies, leading the way to the next generation of highly innovative and competitive companies.

There is growing recognition of the value of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in libraries. This study explores how academic libraries have responded to this opportunity at the level of strategy, what is the status of the application of AI, if any, and what are the different emphases of development comparing the UK and China. The data for the study was strategy documentation from high-ranking universities and their libraries. The sample consisted of the top 25 universities from the United Kingdom and top 25 from the Mainland of China according to the QS world university rankings. Explicit mention of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies is rarely found in strategic plans of universities in the UK but most Chinese universities mention them in their vision statements which focus on the development of new majors and research of the technology. Though several libraries have already implemented applications based on AI or claim to be \u201csmart\u201d or \u201cintelligent\u201d most academic library strategic plans or agendas do not emphasize AI. This is one of the first studies to explore the current status of AI applied in academic libraries as a sector and to compare experiences internationally. Keywords Artificial intelligence Machine Learning Academic libraries University libraries Librarians Strategy Data availability Data summary is Appendix. Introduction It has been suggested that the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is causing a scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation (Phillips & O'Toole, 2014; Spille et al., 2018). Many aspects of our daily lives are undergoing tremendous change due to technologies such as speech recognition, face recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, machine translation, virtual assistants, and intelligent search. AI has shown promising applications in diverse areas such as transportation, health care, and manufacturing, through autonomous driving technology, medical assisted diagnosis, satellite positioning, and robots. It has been seen as heralding the arrival of the 4th Industrial Revolution (Ocholla & Ocholla, 2020) and part of a digital transformation (Hanelt et al., 2021). In response countries around the world have identified the development of AI as a national strategic priority (OECD, 2023). In 2019, the US government signed an Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, which pooled federal government resources to develop AI (Presidential Document of America, 2019). The next year, the European Union issued a white paper On Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust, advocating the establishment of an outstanding and trusted AI ecosystem based on legal regulation (Tiple, 2020). The UK Government (2021) has an AI strategy, as do important UK national institutions such as National Health Service England (2020) and the UK's main research funding body UKRI (2021). In recent years, the Chinese government has also released a series of policies to promote AI research and implementation and put the construction of AI-based smart libraries on the agendas in some key public libraries (The State Council of China, 2021a). Although the idea of applying AI to libraries has been considered since at least 1985, the last five years have seen a wave of intensified interest. Inevitably some people have expressed the fear that robots and intelligent agents might supersede the professional roles of librarians. In practical terms, however, take-up in the sector seems to have been relatively slow (Cox, 2021). Given the call of other demands, resource limitations, and perhaps a certain caution in the acceptance of new technologies, it is not hard to understand that only when new technologies are saturated in the market and patrons have access to them in multiple ways, will libraries consider introducing them (Wheatley & Hervieux, 2019). The prudent response to AI can be seen to echo the patchy character of past library automation and digitalization process, such as the spread of research data management practices (Huang et al., 2021; Wheatley & Hervieux, 2019). In addition, librarians' lack of knowledge of AI, how to integrate AI with the library's existing systems and services, and the high cost of AI products all pose challenges to the adoption of AI in the library (Buhe, 2017; Deng & Yang, 2021; Li et al., 2022). However, on the whole, libraries and librarianship still seem to hold a positive attitude towards the potential changes brought by AI, and the library could take the initiative to adopt AI in a safe, responsible and effective way to improve its working and user services. Most previous studies in the debate about AI are based on the experience of a particular library or in a single country or region, and rarely consider activity across the sector and in two countries at the same time from different cultural contexts. The UK could be seen as the birthplace of Artificial Intelligence, and remains a world leader in specific application areas such as healthcare and financial technology, as well as in the development of AI ethics, governance, and security frameworks. AI is a focus of research funding (UKRI, 2021). China also attaches great importance to the improvement of cultural and social services while developing the economy and technology. In the library and information services area, building the functional smart library and providing efficient public services have become one of the country's long-term goals (The State Council of China, 2021b, 2021a). Since 2018, the annual project guidance of The National Social Science Fund of China (2018) has emphasized the research and application of AI in the library and information management discipline. In a context of change and uncertainty the topic of strategy is of increasing importance. Many institutions are placing greater emphasis on strategy, on envisioning a desired future state, and planning to realize this vision. For libraries a key issue is to position themselves appropriately in relation to wider institutional priorities (Cox, 2018). This can be a form of passive alignment, seeking to demonstrate the library's contribution to the organizational mission, or even proactive in attempting to take a leadership role on campus in certain areas. Examining US library strategies, Saunders (2015) discovers a focus on collections, physical space, collaboration and instruction. Interestingly technology was relatively little mentioned in the plans she examined. Yet given the strategic emphasis placed on AI today it becomes of interest to understand how university libraries have reacted to the current trends of AI from a strategic perspective, how AI and related technologies are being used in academic libraries, and interpret the different approaches to adopting emerging technologies between two very different contexts: the UK and China. Literature review As early as the 1980s, the library community began to pay attention to the potential applications of robots and artificial intelligence. Chen and Chen (1992) proposed that with the increasing quantity of books and other literature, Expert Systems based on AI should be made use of to process documents in batches and realize automatic processing for classification, cataloguing, indexing, and abstracting of documents. However, the possibility of the sustainable development of Expert Systems which use specialized knowledge to deal with complex problems has been doubted due to the expensive expertise required, the time-consuming development process, and the limited scenarios of application. Veaner (1985) believed that the assistance of robots could be leveraged to alleviate library collection management tasks which are labor-intensive, and recommended that the library community should post a systematic watch on AI which might have a greatly different definition and scope from his time. With the development of natural language processing technology and the gradual reduction of hardware costs such as computer processor chips, semantic analysis was seen as having a bright future (Chen & Chen, 1992). It is only much more recently with the continuous enrichment of the definition of AI, the development of technology itself, and the successful application of AI in other fields, that the advocacy for AI application has emerged in higher education and libraries. A study of the future plans of UK academic libraries in 2017 suggested that the use of AI in libraries was not yet widespread, but that the library community believed that AI adoption was a major issue (Pinfield et al., 2017). Another early study selected a total of 25 influential and top-ranking research-intensive universities from the United States and Canada as a research sample to investigate how they were responding to the increasing use of artificial intelligence technology and research, through the analysis of the official website of universities and their libraries (Wheatley & Hervieux, 2019). The results came as a surprise to the authors, that there was almost no presence of AI in the study sample, and that university or university libraries rarely mentioned AI in their strategic plans. Though it was noted that almost all universities were offering AI courses in departments and schools of computer science and mathematics. At the same time, some university libraries offered programming and services related to AI, data visualization, and 3D printing, but few libraries focused on educating patrons on AI or updated current library standards in relation to concerns brought on by AI (Wheatley & Hervieux, 2019). Over the next few years, the penetration of AI into other fields is likely to have encouraged libraries to accelerate their acceptance of AI. As library patrons are exposed to AI products in the rest of their lives, libraries are prompted to accelerate the pace of introducing AI in their own services (Hervieux & Wheatley, 2021). Library directors, library commentators and experts in education and publishing began to hold a positive attitude and agree that AI and related technologies can help libraries move forward to smart libraries from multiple perspectives, in terms of resource discovery, virtual intelligent agents, machine readable collections, and so on (Cox et al., 2019). Reports from OCLC (Padilla, 2019) and Library of Congress (Cordell, 2020) were critical landmarks in this process of defining responsible AI use in libraries. From the perspective of 2023, there is emerging a better picture of the range of AI applications and implications for libraries (Cox & Mazumdar, 2022; Hervieux & Wheatley, 2022). There are direct uses in library services, such as knowledge discovery or chatbots, and libraries can also develop services to support communities of data scientists, and there is also a role for libraries in promoting understanding of AI as part of information literacy (Cox & Mazumdar, 2022). Thus the University of Rhode Island Library created an Artificial Intelligence Lab which provides intelligent experimental space and services for staff, students, and the community (Kim, 2019). The Lab is supported by librarians and professors from different departments and the library has emerged as the leader and become a successful case in involvement with AI. Chatbots or Virtual Agents (VA) developed based on MSN, WeChat, and other apps can provide intelligent consulting such as search, navigation, and reminders (Li et al., 2022), and such VAs based on Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Process (NLP) most common appearance of AI in the academic library. Physical Robots, based on AI and Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) technology, have been developed for picking, moving, and inventory of books or items autonomously without human intervention (Fan & Shao, 2018), and other robots with functions like autonomous navigation, routine clerical and manual task handling, and assistance in the education of students and patrons are being developed in some pioneer libraries (Vlachos et al., 2020). The National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences (NSLC) constructed an open data ecosystem with big data and AI as the main technologies, which consists of a National Science and Technology Innovation Database, a new generation of AI tool platforms, and AI services system for knowledge management, knowledge discovery, intelligent analysis, and technological decision (Qian et al., 2021). Although AI in libraries is often talked about as inevitable, there are still challenges in the process of introducing AI and a lag behind the development of frontier industries (Li et al., 2022) as well as concerns around ethics. Most AI projects in libraries rely on the introduction of mature products from commercial companies, which cannot be easily integrated with the library's existing system or services. New intelligent service projects are self-contained and require high-intensity technical support that most libraries do not have (Cox et al., 2019). There is a long way to go to achieve the \u201csmart\u201d or \u201cintelligent\u201d library and efforts are still needed in the aspects of AI technology itself, the application of AI in libraries, and the librarians' knowledge about AI. As well as these implementation barriers there are significant concerns around the ethics of AI even in library contexts: such as concerns for privacy and around bias and intelligibility. This study explores how academic libraries are responding to AI which is increasingly ubiquitous in our lives, and answers these research questions: 1. How, if at all, is AI being included in university library strategies in the UK and China? 2. What evidence is there for sector-wide adoption of AI in academic libraries in the UK and China? 3. How do the paths of development between the two countries differ? Methodology High-prestige universities possess more abundant funding and, arguably, have a greater ability to take risks. As a consequence, their libraries may be more innovative in accepting cutting-edge concepts or new technical applications (Massis, 2018). Hence, the study selected as its sample the top 25 universities in the UK, and the top 25 in the Mainland of China, based on the QS World University Rankings 2022 (see Table 1 ). Also, given the need for library strategies to align to university strategies it made sense to analyze both together (Cox, 2018). Given the different official languages of the two countries, the study reviewed research articles published in English and Simplified Chinese, as well as the website search keywords. A website search was conducted between 15th December 2022 and 30th January 2023, using two search engines, Bing.com and Baidu.com and applying a site-restricted search approach. The search keywords included Artificial Intelligence (\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd), Machine Learning (\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60), deep learning (\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60), AI hub (AI\u4e2d\u5fc3), robot (\u673a\u5668\u4eba), and the Simplified Chinese counterparts are shown in the brackets. In addition, the study also checked whether there are AI institutions, departments, or courses in the universities. The needs of large majors or disciplines teaching AI are bound to have an impact on library services, such as collecting. The authors collected materials or documents that reflected the universities and their libraries' strategic priorities or key areas of development in future years, such as strategic plans, visions, development programmes, agendas, and statements which can be found on the official websites of both universities and libraries. A simple content analysis approach was used to discover the appearance of AI-related keywords as above in documents of strategy or vision or plan, and the word frequency was recorded. As the study sought to interpret the topic from the academic libraries' perspective, the paper also explored the websites of sample libraries to examine whether AI applications such as intelligent virtual agents have existed or are planned to implement in the future. Though developing for decades, there is no unified and standard definition of AI, and various scholars and institutions have their interpretations (Cox & Mazumdar, 2022). For librarians, artificial intelligence may be confused with the concepts of library automation, intelligent or smart library, as a consequence of lacking knowledge and lower perceptions of AI. So, it is understandable that libraries take automatic products as AI and advertise services as AI which might not be considered such. Furthermore, not all the robots and chatbots which are beginning to be used in libraries are based on AI (Cox & Mazumdar, 2022). Hence, during the search for AI-related or intelligent products or services in the libraries, the authors collected all the items which were claimed to be intelligent products or services, and did not identify strictly whether those items are based on AI technology or not, then showed all of them in the next section. Findings AI in universities According to the results of the website study, all the sample universities have future strategic plans, however, the time span of each strategy is different, ranging from 4 to 10 years, most commonly 4 to 6 years. They also vary in style and approach: from high-level visions to detailed plans. The strategy documents collected were relatively new, and the strategic plans of 38 of the universities had been released after 2020, so could be expected to reflect current thinking about AI since this date is after the major national policy was released in both countries. The authors conducted a content analysis of those strategic plans and counted the word frequency of AI-related keywords (see Table 2 ). The results showed that AI/ML was mentioned in the strategies of 24 universities, 3 of which were from the UK and 21 were from China, the total number of times that AI-related words appeared in the documents is 171, 3 % (5 out of 171 times) are from British universities and 97 % (165 out of 171 times) are from Chinese ones, the maximum is 22 which from the Fudan University, and the average value is 3.4, which might imply the unevenly distributed of these words in the strategies. However, the content mentioned about AI/ML was about the development of AI majors, disciplines, and colleges, which was less directly relevant to the application of AI in the university library. However, it was also found that 5 universities have set out the goal of building smart libraries in the vision section of their strategies. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies and the demand for AI professionals in various industrial sectors, universities around the world have been offering AI-related courses which aim to promote the cultivation of AI professionals. Nearly every university in the sample has introduced such courses on AI, and some universities have established AI research institutes or departments. Others have established an AI/ML curriculum in the department of Computer Science or Data Science, and all implemented AI research or learning centers most of which are located in academic departments rather than in the library. AI in libraries The analysis showed that 19 libraries have strategic plans, of which 15 plans are officially released documents and 4 plans are in the form of visions or agendas. Keyword searches found that none of the strategic plans mentions AI/ML. 18 libraries have already introduced AI applications or offer AI services, or more accurately, some intelligent services, including 2 in the UK and 16 in China. As shown in Fig. 1 , there are 9 libraries that provide intelligent virtual agents, enquiry robots, or Chatbot services, but most of these services are based on a dataset of previous Q&A, which are not strictly AI agents. The authors found one real AI based smart talking robot developed by Tsinghua University Library from the literature review, not website exploration (Yao et al., 2015). The robot Xiaotu had been pre-trained with a significant volume of data and was able to learn from communication data to improve its answers continuously. After being put into use for some years, certain users discovered the robot's self-learning and self-improvement features, and intentionally fed the robot with false data, resulting in some toxic language expressions in its answers. As a consequence of a growing number of wrong answers, the library had to stop using the robot for enquiry or chatting. However, several years after that, the library improved and upgraded Xiaotu, the first-generation robot, and launched the Intelligent Question and Answer System, an information service conversation system (Tsinghua University Library, 2021). In the sample, seven libraries held AI-themed forums, lectures, seminars, etc., and two libraries provided AI-related resources, such as the introduction of AI/ML tools, and AI/ML-related resource navigation and guidelines. Four libraries cooperated with third-party companies or academic departments to participate in the development and application of AI products, or to introduce intelligent products. Nanjing University Library has made the most outstanding achievements, participating in the development of AI-related products such as the intelligent inventory robot, Nanjing University library service platform, prototype of next-generation intelligent library management system, and so on. Peking University Medical Library introduced the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS) after the rebuilding and redesigning project of its main body, which frees up space from bookshelves for users. Wuhan University Library has worked with Baidu Inc., the largest Chinese search company, to build an AI library, but no further details or implementation steps can be found on the website. Discussion Strategies of universities and libraries Even if AI is mentioned in the strategic plans of some universities, this mainly refers to the development of majors in AI and has little to do with the library or the application of AI to university operations. What is interesting is that most universities (88 %, 21 out of 24 universities) that mention AI in their strategies are from the Mainland of China, while AI/ML or relevant keywords are sporadic in strategies collected from the sample British universities. This phenomenon may be related to the different approaches of the two countries' universities in drafting future strategies. We have a very small sample in our study but it appears that the strategic plans of Chinese universities are typically concrete plans with detailed roadmaps in every discipline, which also emphasize the majors and institutional structures that need to be developed as priority in the next few years, such as research on new technologies. In contrast, the strategic plans of British universities appear to consist of a vision and mention aspirations including high quality, impactful research, excellent student experiences, global reach, and a civic role, with, as emerging themes, an emphasis on well-being and equality, diversity, and inclusion. They say far less about specific majors and technologies. In addition, we suggest that the research and development of AI-related technologies and products have been highlighted at the Chinese national strategic level, so vigorously promoting the development of AI in every sector including HE. The circumstances in the UK are subtly different. Although the government has in recent years embraced AI as an engine for industrial development (Wang, 2022) and issued the AI Roadmap to further clarify the UK's AI development strategy and priorities (Office for artificial intelligence, 2021), universities have autonomy in developing their values, principles, characteristics, and development priorities, and do not unquestioningly pursue technological hotspots or show evidence of being strongly influenced by government policy. Consistent with Saunders' (2015) findings that technology is rarely the focus of library plans, neither British nor Chinese universities mention the application of AI in libraries in their strategic documents. This does not mean, however, that universities or academic libraries are not interested in AI. Quite the contrary, several UK universities in the sample published digital strategies, which do not necessarily mention AI/ML either, but that does show that some institutions are thinking in terms of fundamental digital transformations. The University of Leeds (2021) has released digital strategies that directly talk about support for research areas including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence/deep learning, Internet of Things, robotics, etc. Similarly, the Digital Strategic Delivery Plan from the University of Nottingham (2021) defines digital as an effective combination of organizational and technological processes to generate value, which organization and technology are key elements. Since digital technology refers to a wide range of technical solutions including analytics, data visualization, and decision logic, and so on, it can be seen that the attractions of emerging technologies to universities do exist, with an emphasis on digital skills. Therefore, it is worth considering whether the focus of the future strategy will shift from AI to digital as a whole, and digital transformation as a cultural and workforce priority as much as a technological one (Brooks & McCormack, 2020; Iosad, 2020; Skelton, 2023). Service and products in libraries Although the study expanded the search from AI-related services to intelligent services during the explorations of libraries' websites, few applications, products or services based on artificial intelligence or machine learning could be found in the sample academic libraries, which suggests the slow progress of their adoption. Several libraries claim to have developed intelligent virtual agents or chatbots, but only the smart talking robot Xiaotu developed by Tsinghua University Library and the book inventory robots developed by Nanjing University Library are real AI products. The former is based on Natural Language Processing (Yao et al., 2015), the latter has combined robot technology and RFID (Fan & Shao, 2018; Ni, 2017), and the rest use little artificial intelligence technologies. In most cases, the automatic reply agents or robots can only deal with some simple enquiries which are phrased in a standard way. When facing more complex questions, since they do not have the ability to process natural language they cannot respond directly to requests. Comparison of the two countries There is an obvious difference in that all the eight libraries making available intelligent enquiry or assistants or chatbot services are from China, and the British libraries have not yet created such services. But we cannot conclude that the introduction of intelligent assistants or chatbots in the British academic library lags behind that of China, because the previous literature review section shows that artificial intelligence originated in the UK, and China often appears to lag behind European and American countries in many aspects including library and information science sector (such as in the case of RDM (Huang et al., 2021). The efficiency of chatbots applications in the library is still controversial. Although stakeholders are inclined to introduce chatbot technology to deliver diverse services (Kaushal & Yadav, 2022), there is lacking user experience to evaluate the applications. Studies have proved that chatbots are not very successful in library application in the North American context (Lin, 2022). Another issue is how to collect user behavior data which is used to train the machine to make the robot-human communication more in line with user habits (Yang & Deng, 2021). Since mature AI products are relatively expensive (Cox et al., 2019) and require a large scale of training data and a certain number of technical professionals, the overall cost may outweigh that of librarians to carry out consulting services by themselves. Therefore, it may be that Chinese libraries are still in the early stages of introducing chatbots, while British libraries may have already reached a realization that they are not effective. A promising area of the application of AI is knowledge discovery of content such as large-scale image collections, sound collections, handwritten text, etc., where AI can efficiently describe content at scale (Cox & Mazumdar, 2022). However, for academic libraries it is logical to assume that these may not be so central issues compared to delivering book and journal content to students, where library catalogues already perform adequately. This is another possible reason for AI not to have developed very far to date. We see much more innovation in these areas from national libraries which have large unique collections requiring advanced search (Lorang et al., 2020; Qian et al., 2021). It may be that we are too early in the cycle of AI adoption to expect to see more reference to it in strategies. Though not using the same terminology, the sample universities from the two countries both mentioned concepts or terms which are more wide-ranging than AI, for example, \u201cdigital strategy\u201d or \u201ctransformation\u201d in some Britain universities, and \u201cintelligent libraries\u201d in Chinese ones. These concepts are closely connected to a diverse spectrum of newly emerging technologies that include but are not limited to AI. Hence, universities and libraries may locate AI as a part of a wider digital transformation strategy or one of the approaches to achieve an intelligent library but not the center of a strategy, which is in line with the lack of AI-related keywords in university strategic plans. The similarity between the two countries is that there are various challenges in the process of introducing AI in the library, such as the lag of development behind frontier economic industries (Li et al., 2022) and the lack of funds and professional skills which are necessary for applying AI products. We can speculate that slow progress in adopting AI may reflect that libraries from both countries seek relatively easy and feasible ways to follow the trend of AI and progress smart library goals, with limited funds and human resources. Challenges of applying AI in academic libraries AI has significant technical barriers for libraries, e.g. it may be hard to apply algorithms trained on contemporary material to historic collections because they have different characteristics. An algorithm trained on contemporary images may be less effective with historic images, for example, because many objects such as buildings, d\u00e9cor and clothing look different. Significantly, from the authors' experience most UK academic libraries also lack large technical development teams and tend to buy off-the-shelf solutions. This is partly because IT departments tend to control technical development and also because libraries' identities focus on other things such as access to content. Also, the application of technologies entails risk. By reputation libraries have often been seen as somewhat risk averse (e.g. Joint, 2007) though we know of no systematic study of this. Libraries probably adopt a more professional approach to risk management today, but our results can be seen as reflecting a degree of risk aversity with a concentration on delivering reliable services at scale. Most AI products manufactured by commercial companies are not easily integrated with the library's existing systems and services which seems a common issue when introducing new products in academic libraries (Kaushal & Yadav, 2022). The new intelligent service projects are self-contained and require a high level of technical support that most libraries are not able to supply. A few libraries with strong technical resources cooperate with a third party to develop products suitable for their libraries, but these may be difficult to diffuse widely. Ultimately, echoing Saunders' (2015) findings, academic libraries have many priorities which compete with applying the latest technologies and tend to focus on the roles in user education and traditional services, such as the managing and access to collections, and maintenance of physical and virtual learning space and this may lead to hesitancy in keeping up with technologies that are partly suspected of being hype. An overabundance of caution? The technical and resourcing overhead of AI partly helps to explain the limited academic library engagement with AI reported in this study, but other factors such as mindset may also come into play. A cautious library stance towards technological change has been noted and this has deep roots. Almost five decades ago, Lancaster (1978) expressed frustration at what he saw as a \u201cmyopic\u201d view in the library profession towards the future and in particular the coming shift from print to digital formats and communications. He observed a sense of denial, with the profession seeming to have its \u201chead in the sand\u201d. More generally, there are questions about the level of attention which academic libraries afford towards appreciating and anticipating radical change. Their laudable commitment to service brings a risk that resources are prioritised towards internal processes rather than external engagement, with a focus on the immediate term at the expense of future thinking. The emphasis on collections and space over technology in the 63 academic library strategies studied by Saunders (2015) reflects a strong internal focus. Budd (2018) has identified a librarian tendency towards linear thinking, seeing related issues in isolation, and failing to connect developments in the outside world with the local environment. This can make it difficult to contemplate and appreciate the scale of change potentially associated with AI. The struggle to understand AI may be linked to a recent finding that only 16 % of US academic library directors in a 2022 survey (Hulbert, 2023) agreed that their library had a clear vision of futureproofing that takes into account technological and socio-political trends. This finding, unlikely to be exclusive to academic library leadership in the US, indicates a lack of confidence which could be holding back a deeper engagement with, and strategic commitment towards, AI. Another inhibiting factor may be an overly conservative approach to discontinuing past activities and the library literature contains few references to Peter Drucker's concept of planned abandonment (Martin & Sheehan, 2018). A tendency to continue with services of interest to dwindling audiences can consume resources otherwise available for experimentation and exploration (Stoffle et al., 2008). The concerns of the library profession with the ethical implications of AI are well-founded. Librarian values of privacy, intellectual freedom, neutrality, transparency, equality and diversity are all at risk of compromise through AI or ML. Anxiety about AI technologies and their consequences may be a further source of hesitation towards, and refrain from, deeper engagement by academic libraries. An alternative view, and indeed mindset, would be that the ethical issues associated with AI are the very reason why academic libraries should give priority to engaging with it, thereby upholding their values strongly. Such involvement can be relatively low-cost but highly impactful and welcomed by others grappling with how to make the most of these technologies. An obvious case in point would be a deep engagement with the implications for information literacy and academic integrity of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT which are currently exercising a lot attention among academic staff. Too much caution may itself carry risk and academic libraries could be significantly disadvantaged if they fall behind the curve, leaving it to vendors to develop products, possibly with in-built bias, in areas of interest to libraries and higher education, notably rapid citation analysis and digests of the literature (Williams & Grove, 2023), as well as applications specific to libraries such as collections as data and automated generation of metadata. A stronger focus on the potential benefits of AI for academic libraries may be appropriate, noting opportunities to bring efficiency to labour-intensive operations and to divert resources to activities that can move libraries further up the institutional value chain. Embracing AI constructively but judiciously seems sensible, making time for experimentation and signaling an appreciation of the potential for profound change by giving prominence to AI in academic library strategy. Conclusion This study is one of the first to analyze the status of the application of AI in Chinese and British academic libraries at the sector level and explore the adoption of AI from the perspectives of strategy and practical application. In the sample of high-ranking university libraries, the authors found some applications of AI products and services. Although the types of applications are relatively simple, mainly focusing on virtual assistants, resource navigation, events or lectures, and robots, it is certain that libraries have actively explored AI in recent years. But the engagement in this emerging technical trend is uneven, some academic libraries are able to design and develop products based on AI technology while some have no information or content about AI/ML/intelligence on their websites. Librarians' application of AI seems to remain at a low level to date. We have to acknowledge a number of limitations to the study and further investigations are needed to fully understand how the use of AI is developing, in a rapidly developing context. Fundamentally, the approach we took relied heavily on material published on web sites. This does not necessarily fully or consistently represent actual activity. It is indicative of major commitments, but it may well miss many initiatives which are in their early stages. Follow up interviews with library directors or a survey would be a useful way to determine the facts here. Surveys of current practice, projects in hand and technology adopted across the sector in both countries would be very useful, as AI does start to be adopted. Also, we focused on high status institutions on the assumption that they have the resources to lead development in the sector, but it may well be that there was more activity in the large number of institutions not investigated. Studies of other institutions and, of course, in other countries are needed. It would also be useful to expand the study to discover how current change is being driven, eg whether it is on specific technologies like AI, on a wider digital transformation, or whether it is rooted in other drivers. Research to better understand how libraries develop their strategies in the context of their institution and national policy trends would also help place studies like this in context. Libraries' attitudes towards AI can be summed up as prudent. This approach could be argued to be the optimal plan for current conditions. The library, as a function-oriented unit within the university, should choose feasible technical routes to meet the demands of its role, rather than chasing the hottest technologies indiscriminately. If new technologies, like AI/ML/NLP, can accelerate the process of achieving goals or raise the efficiency of professional processes, then active exploration is undoubtedly justified, but concrete application needs to consider other factors, such as whether there is sufficient funding, what the value generated is, what support is available from the institution, and the technical ability and skills of librarians. If there are strong barriers or well-established approaches already work well technology may not be adopted. Yet the prominence of AI in current HE agendas should prompt a level of active engagement with a stress on finding useful and ethical applications.

Future studies will need to establish whether a standardized ablation vs patient-tailored set may suffice to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a sustained cardiac arrhythmia whose drivers and mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood. The most current estimates predict that up to 12 million people in the United States will be affected by 2050. 1 Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the cornerstone of treatment for paroxysmal AF but has lower efficacy in persistent AF, where the drivers perpetuating AF often lie outside the pulmonary veins (PV). 2\u20134 Certain ablation strategies for AF treatment aim to target AF drivers. 5 Recently, a signature of electrical AF drivers has been demonstrated and defined as \u201cdispersion.\u201d 6 Dispersion areas are described as local clusters of electrograms that may or may not be fractionated, and they display interelectrode time and space dispersion such that activation is spread over the entire AF cycle length (Figure 1 ). Studies have shown a high degree of acute termination with a low level of AF recurrence in persistent/long-standing persistent AF patients undergoing dispersion-based ablation. 6 As visual dispersion mapping is challenging to perform, a real-time artificial intelligence (AI) software (VX1; Volta Medical, Marseille, France) compatible with current electrophysiology mapping systems and trained to determine multipolar electrogram dispersion has been developed. 7 We report the first redo paroxysmal AF procedures using the AI software, and compare them to our initial 2 persistent AF patients. Case report vAF ablation was performed in the usual fashion, briefly described as follows. Patients were placed under general anesthesia and vascular access was obtained in the femoral veins. A multi-pole catheter was placed into the coronary sinus, and a single transseptal puncture was performed under intracardiac echocardiography guidance after administration of intravenous heparin, to maintain an activated clotting time of 350\u2013400 seconds. Esophageal temperature was monitored, using the Esosure esophageal deviation tool if necessary. Mapping was performed with a PENTARAY catheter (Biosense Webster, Irvine, CA). The AI software (VX1; Volta Medical) user interface (Figure 1) was placed on a mobile table visible to the operator with a separate screen for the mapping technician. During initial anatomic mapping, dispersion points were collected by placing the catheter in one position for 3\u20134 seconds and manually tagging points the system determined to be dispersed with a very high likelihood (red signal) or high likelihood (orange signal). Biatrial mapping took 20\u201330 minutes. Ablation was performed using a Biosense Webster ST/SF ablation catheter at 45 W, targeting a Surpoint ablation index of 350\u2013500 depending on the anatomic site. Large areas with dense dispersion areas were encircled; PVI was performed after initial dispersion ablation sets. For patients presenting in sinus rhythm, burst pacing in the atrium was performed down to 160 ms or failure to capture. If that failed to induce sustained AF, isuprel was initiated at 2 mcg/min with repeated pacing for induction and titrated to 10 mcg/min as necessary for induction. Isuprel was discontinued several minutes prior to mapping. AF ablation was performed in 4 patients (Table 1 ). Patient 1 The first patient with paroxysmal AF is a 68-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and AF, who underwent PVI in 2017. The patient had early recurrence after several months but mild symptoms. Rhythm was monitored daily using a Kardia monitor, with burden of 20%\u201340%. Fatigue and exercise intolerance experienced by the patient led to a repeat ablation. The patient was in and out of AF during mapping. Left superior PV and both right PVs were reconnected. Dispersion mapping during AF defined regions of dispersion in the low posterior left atrium (LA) inferior to the left inferior PV, in the right carina, and anteriorly between the right superior PV and mitral annulus. Dispersion was noted at the coronary sinus ostium. Targeted ablation of dispersion areas in the LA was first performed, after which paroxysms of AF were no longer seen. The PVs were then reisolated. Rapid atrial pacing failed to reinduce any arrhythmia (Figure 2A ). At follow-up to 1 year, the patient had no reported symptoms or evidence of AF on daily Kardia recordings. Patient 2 The second patient with paroxysmal AF is a 53-year-old man with prior mild cerebrovascular accident and persistent AF who had undergone ablation in 2016 (Table 1). The patient had presented again with a small cerebrovascular accident after having been off anticoagulation, and was found to have recurrent AF with very rapid ventricular response and palpitations. The patient presented for ablation in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and sustained AF was induced during isoproterenol infusion. Dispersion areas were found in the low posterior wall, anterior to the right superior PV, and in the reconnected right carina (the right PVs were reconnected; the left PVs remained isolated). Termination of AF occurred during ablation at the right carina. The remainder of the dispersion areas were ablated, and the right veins were then reisolated (Figure 2B). The AI software mapped points and electrograms at the most dispersed region and site of termination are shown in Figure 3 . Because the patient had remained paroxysmal, there was PV reconnection and significant dispersion in the right PV carina with termination of induced AF at the most dispersed region, the right atrium was not mapped. The patient was not inducible at the conclusion of the case. The patient has not had symptomatic recurrence. Patient 3 The third patient is a 65-year-old man who had long-standing persistent AF and history of coronary artery disease (Table 1). The patient reported an initial diagnosis of AF about 10 years prior to evaluation and was paroxysmal at first, but AF was continuous for the last 2 years. The patient described exertional dyspnea and palpitations. Echo demonstrated moderate biatrial enlargement without significant valvular disease and normal ejection fraction. Dispersion mapping noted extensive dispersion in the LA, with limited areas in the right atrial septum. Dispersion regions in the LA roof, anterior wall, and inferoposterior wall were ablated. PV were then isolated, resulting in posterior wall isolation. Right atrial dispersion was noted near the atrioventiruclar node and limited ablation was undertaken (Figure 2C). The patient was cardioverted at the end of the procedure. At follow-up the patient developed recurrent atrial tachycardia requiring reablation; he has maintained NSR on dofetilide. Patient 4 The last patient was a 61-year-old man who had persistent AF and history of severe cardiomyopathy related to uncontrolled ventricular rate (Table 1). AF was first diagnosed in 2012 but progressed to persistent AF, and cardioversion was required in 2014 and 2016. Recently he suffered a recurrence, this time associated with severe cardiomyopathy, and a third cardioversion was performed after amiodarone initiation. AF was induced by rapid atrial pacing and extensive areas in the LA exhibited dispersion. The PVs were isolated, but the patient remained in AF. Given extensive posterior wall dispersion, posterior wall isolation was attempted but was limited by esophageal temperature rises. Ablation on the LA roof, at a dense cluster of dispersed electrograms, resulted in termination of AF into sinus rhythm (Figure 2D). He has remained in NSR at all follow-up visits to 1 year. Discussion Although multiple mapping technologies have been implemented to explore the extra-PV substrate in patients undergoing de novo ablation, 8 , 9 much less is known about the feasibility of using electrogram-based approaches for reablation patients. In the past, the Topera technology and, more recently, the Ablacon technology have been suggested to improve the outcome of reablation patients. 10 , 11 Here, we present 2 reablation paroxysmal AF cases in which a real-time mapping technology was implemented. Although the acute and medium-term outcomes in these 2 patients seemed satisfactory (noninducibility and no relapse), it should be emphasized that a larger clinical investigation is required. Here, we have presented 2 de novo ablation patients and 2 reablation patients, all of whom were managed with intraprocedural mapping using the AI software. From the description of these cases, their operative workflow, and outcomes, it would seem that patients undergoing a de novo ablation in persistent AF and those undergoing a redo ablation have been managed similarly. It is paramount, however, to underline key differences between de novo ablated and reablated patients. Firstly, both patients admitted for reablation were suffering from paroxysmal AF episodes. By contrast, de novo ablation patients were in persistent AF. Arguably, ablation protocols and lesion sets need to be distinct when a patient is only in paroxysmal AF, albeit the PVs might still be isolated. One future direction for investigation will be to determine whether ablation sets need to be adapted to the AF presentation (persistent or paroxysmal) and to the procedural history (de novo vs redo), or to both. Here, artificial intelligence approaches might be ideally suited to modulate the procedural management based on these parameters. 12 In conclusion, VX1 is an AI-based software solution designed to obtain real-time adjudications of multipolar electrograms. This software-based mapping approach may be integrated in the workflow of patients admitted for both de novo persistent and redo paroxysmal AF. In the cases presented, noninducibility and favorable outcomes were achieved after a relatively extensive ablation set. The utility of dispersion ablation beyond the PVs in our paroxysmal patients is anecdotal, but a clinical trial is underway to specifically answer whether tailored dispersion-based ablation in repeat paroxysmal patients with isolated PVs improves clinical outcomes. 13 Disclosures Dr Goldbarg is on the Scientific Advisory Board of Volta Medical, and is the US principal investigator of the Tailored-AF Trial.

Keywords Artificial Intelligence Colon Polyps Computer-Aided Detection CADe CADx Computer-Aided Diagnosis Abbreviations used in this paper ADR adenoma detection rate AI artificial intelligence APC adenomas detected per colonoscopy CADe computer-aided detection CADx computer-aided diagnosis CRC colorectal cancer FEQ fold evaluation quality Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. 1 Screening colonoscopy reduces the risk of CRC through the removal of precancerous polyps. 2 Polyp detection is operator-dependent, with adenoma detection rates (ADRs) ranging widely from 7% to 53% among colonoscopists. 3 Failure to detect and remove neoplastic polyps is associated with the development of post-colonoscopy interval CRC, which accounts for nearly 8% of all diagnosed CRC. 4 Conversely, a 1% increase in a colonoscopist\u2019s ADR has been associated with a 3% decrease in future CRC risk. 3 However, the majority of polyps detected during colonoscopy are diminutive and non-neoplastic. 5 Unnecessary resection and pathologic evaluation of these non-neoplastic lesions can be associated with increased costs and risk for adverse events. These critical issues around colon polyp detection and diagnosis have been a central focus for a range of artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have recently been introduced to the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy. As with any emerging technology, there are important questions and challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that AI tools are introduced safely and effectively into clinical endoscopic practice. This commentary incorporates important and recently published studies in the field and elaborates on the future directions of AI in colonoscopy. Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision The term artificial intelligence refers to computer systems performing complex tasks that would normally require the use of the human brain, such as visual perception (\u201ccomputer vision\u201d), speech recognition, and decision making. 6 Early attempts at polyp detection required explicit programming of software to recognize certain polyp features (eg, textures and shapes). 7 These early efforts were focused on recognizing still images because computer-processing speed at that time could not support real-time, live video image analysis. Since then, major advances in deep-learning algorithms using convolutional neural networks have dramatically expanded the capabilities of computer vision for endoscopy. These contemporary algorithms are trained on large data sets and can adapt and \u201clearn\u201d to recognize complex objects in live video. 8 The most important applications of AI computer vision in colonoscopy today include computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx). CADe is designed to help the endoscopist detect polyps during colonoscopy and CADx is intended to accurately predict polyp histology without the need for a tissue biopsy. Artificial Intelligence for Detection of Colorectal Polyps (Computer-Aided Detection) AI detection of colorectal polyps was the first target for AI technology in gastroenterology and now a myriad of studies has reported the successful application of AI for the recognition of colon polyps using CADe. These algorithms are the equivalent of a highly trained set of eyes relentlessly scanning the monitor alongside the endoscopist, while simultaneously \u201cflagging\u201d lesions that potentially represent precancerous polyps (Figure 1 ). Urban and colleagues 9 reported one of the earliest applications of convolutional neural network\u2013based CADe on video clips. Their algorithm showed 97% sensitivity, 95% specificity, and 96% accuracy for detection of colorectal polyps, which was superior to the performance of the endoscopists. Importantly, 92% of polyps missed by the endoscopists were detected by the CADe. 9 In the last several years, numerous prospective, multicenter studies have found that real-time use of AI CADe tools during colonoscopy leads to improvements in adenoma detection and other related performance metrics. A meta-analysis by Huang et al 10 of 10 randomized controlled trials with 6629 patients found that both ADR (relative risk [RR], 1.43; P < .001) and polyp detection rate (RR, 1.44; P < .001) were significantly greater with AI-aided colonoscopy compared with routine colonoscopy. The adenomas detected per colonoscopy (APC) and polyps detected per colonoscopy were also significantly higher in the AI-aided group compared with the routine colonoscopy group. 10 Despite these positive early results, recent studies have suggested that CADe may not improve adenoma detection in every clinical setting. In a retrospective single-center pragmatic trial, Ladabaum et al 11 reported that CADe did not improve ADR, APC, or other detection metrics when compared with historic and concurrent controls. 11 In a separate, large, retrospective, observational study, Levy et al 12 reported a lower ADR in the CADe group compared with a pre-CADe retrospective control (30.3% vs 35.2%; P = .001), as well as a lower polyp detection rate and lower APC. 12 In addition to these observational studies, a recent trial from the United Kingdom with patients randomized to CADe vs standard colonoscopy also failed to demonstrate a difference in ADR. There are several plausible explanations for the lack of benefit of CADe across these studies. For one, the possibility of a \u201cceiling\u201d effect for polyp detection among high-performing endoscopists may have accounted for the lack of incremental benefit with CADe. In addition, there may be an unconscious behavioral change, for instance, degradation in the quality of mucosal exposure, possibly due to a false sense of security that CADe ensures a high-quality examination. Alternatively, we should also acknowledge that in the majority of published randomized controlled trials, the endoscopists are unblinded and it is possible that this could introduce performance bias, favoring CADe performance. Cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy also needs to be examined carefully, as there are several ways this technology may increase health expenditure. The adenoma detection improvements noted using CADe are attributed mainly to the increased detection of small, nonadvanced adenomas. Indeed, one could argue that the increased detection of small benign polyps by AI could inadvertently lead to more unnecessary resections, thereby increasing cost and procedural risks. Shaukat and colleagues' recent US multicenter, randomized, parallel study 13 at 5 academic and community centers by 22 US board-certified gastroenterologists helped address this concern. The primary end points were APC, total number of adenomas resected divided by the total number of colonoscopies; and true histology rate, defined as the proportion of resections with clinically significant histology divided by the total number of polyp resections. There were 677 patients in the standard colonoscopy group and 682 patients in the CADe group. APC was significantly higher in the CADe group (standard vs CADe, 0.83 vs 1.05) with no decrease in true histology with use of the CADe device. Overall, the results suggest that CADe may help improve APC without a concomitant (and potentially costly) increase in the resection of non-neoplastic lesions. Another mechanism by which CADe may lead to increased health expenditure is higher polyp detection leading to shorter colonoscopy surveillance intervals. One recent study by Mori and colleagues 14 estimated that the use of AI during colonoscopy increased the proportion of patients requiring intensive colonoscopy surveillance by approximately 35% in the United States and 20% in Europe, with absolute increases of 2.9% and 1.3%, respectively. However, increases in ADR can increase early detection of colon cancer and save costs due to cancer management. Areia and colleagues 15 conducted a study using a Markov model microsimulation to investigate the effect of implementing AI-assisted colonoscopy on colon cancer incidence, mortality, and cost-effectiveness. Compared with no screening, the relative reduction of CRC incidence with screening colonoscopy without AI tools was 44.2% and for screening colonoscopy with AI tools was 48.9% (4.8% incremental gain). AI detection tools decreased the discounted costs per screened individual from $3400 to $3343 (a saving of $57 per individual). At the US population level, the implementation of AI detection during screening colonoscopy resulted in yearly additional prevention of 7194 CRC cases and 2089 related deaths, and a yearly saving of $290 million. 15 Naturally, however, the cost-effectiveness of this technology relies on the assumptions that ADR will increase from baseline in real-world clinical practice, an outcome that still needs to be corroborated in further studies. We are just beginning to understand more about AI\u2013human interaction and physician attitudes toward AI in gastroenterology. A study from Nehme et al 16 evaluated the real-world performance of AI-assisted colonoscopy using a commercially available CADe platform in a fully democratized fashion, in which the entire faculty of a large US academic institution was given the opportunity to perform AI-assisted colonoscopy. The decision to activate the CADe system was at the discretion of the endoscopist. An anonymous survey was circulated among endoscopy physicians and staff at the beginning and at the conclusion of the study period regarding their attitudes toward AI-assisted colonoscopy. CADe was activated in 52.1% of cases. Survey results demonstrated mixed attitudes toward AI-assisted colonoscopy, with some physicians expressing concerns regarding the number of false-positive signals, the possibility of distraction (eg, due to false positives or audio alerts), and the impression that it could prolong procedure time. In our own experience, the concern for false-positive alerts remains one of the largest concerns and possible deterrents to the incorporation of AI-assisted colonoscopy. This is an area where human\u2013AI interaction comes to the fore. Although there have been assumptions that CADe could be a \u201cplug and play\u201d technology, we propose there may be a role for more formalized training to teach endoscopists how to use CADe most effectively, including best approaches to efficiently recognize and dismiss false positives. As with many new clinical technologies, there may be a physician learning curve for CADe. Optimizing this and other aspects of the physician\u2013AI collaboration will be an important area of ongoing investigation. Finally, it is imperative for CADe developers to continue to optimize CADe system performance to balance the high sensitivity needed for avoidance of missed lesions, while limiting the noise from false-positive signals. Artificial Intelligence for Characterization of Colorectal Polyps (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) For many years, expectations have grown that optical diagnosis of colorectal polyps would enable \u201cresect-and-discard\u201d or \u201cdiagnose-and-leave\u201d strategies, reducing the need for polypectomy and/or histopathology processing for diminutive polyps. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy created an initiative in 2011 entitled \u201cPreservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations\u201d that identified optical characterization of colorectal polyps <5 mm in size as a key area for new endoscopic technologies. In order to safely adopt a diagnose-and-leave strategy for suspected hyperplastic polyps <5 mm in the rectosigmoid, endoscopists, supported by endoscopic technologies, should provide a \u226590% negative predictive value for adenomatous histology. In order to adopt a resect-and-discard strategy for colorectal polyps <5 mm, the endoscopic technology used to determine histology of these polyps should provide >90% agreement in assignment of post-polypectomy surveillance intervals compared with decisions based on pathology assessment of all identified polyps. 17 Overall, adenomas in the colon <5 mm and hyperplastic polyps in the rectosigmoid <5 mm account for >80% of all polyps detected during screening and surveillance colonoscopy. 18 If resect-and-discard or diagnoses-and-leave strategies were more broadly adopted in clinical practice, the potential economic savings could be substantial, with yearly savings estimated between $33 million and $150 million per year. 19 , 20 CADx tools may play an important role in supporting physicians\u2019 ability to perform optical diagnosis during colonoscopy by providing real-time reliable histopathological predictions for colon polyps (Figure 2 ). 21 Although current methods of optical polyp diagnosis typically rely on virtual chromoendoscopy, such as narrow band imaging, there is promise that CADx tools may be able to perform this task with white light alone. Combining CADe polyp detection with white-light CADx holds particular promise for supporting more efficient approaches toward diagnosing and managing polyps during colonoscopy. Real-time CADx clinical trials are starting to emerge, and results are encouraging. Hassan and colleagues 22 recently conducted a study using simultaneous CADe and CADx algorithms during screening colonoscopy. The CADx module worked with high-definition white-light unmagnified endoscopy and implemented a convolutional neural network classifier that ran in real time on several images of the same lesion to build up a prediction of adenoma or nonadenoma. For each polyp, CADx output and subsequent endoscopist diagnosis with advanced imaging were matched against the histology gold standard. Overall, 544 polyps were removed in 162 patients, of which 295 (54.2%) were rectosigmoid histologically verified lesions <5 mm. CADx diagnosis was feasible in 98.6% of polyps, and the negative predictive value for rectosigmoid lesions <5 mm was 97.6%. There were 242 of 295 lesions (82%) that were amenable for a \u201cleave in situ\u201d strategy. Based on CADx output, 212 of 544 (39%) would be amenable to a resect-and-discard strategy, resulting in a 95.9% agreement between CADx and histology-based surveillance intervals according to US guidelines. This study provided important evidence that a real-time CADx system was able to exceed the 90% negative predictive value for adenomatous histology required for the leave in situ strategy in standard white-light endoscopy. In the study population, a CADx-assisted diagnose-and-leave strategy would result in a 44.4% reduction of all of the polypectomies and related costs. Moreover, with the addition of a CADx-assisted resect-and-discard strategy for certain small polyps requiring resection, this would have further reduced the need for pathology to only 17% of the lesions detected in the study, with a >95% agreement with histology-based post-polypectomy surveillance. An important promise of AI CADx algorithms is the possibility of supporting endoscopists to perform optical diagnosis with a higher baseline level of reliability and confidence. A recent study by Barua et al 23 demonstrated that a CADx-based tool (in this case, requiring a 520\u00d7 magnifying colonoscope) did not increase diagnostic sensitivity, but importantly, improved the confidence level of endoscopists in rendering a diagnosis (high confidence diagnosis for 74.2% during standard visual inspection vs 92.6% when supported by CADx). Increasing endoscopist confidence in optical diagnosis may be an important step toward broader implementation of leave in situ and resect-and-discard strategies, but successful implementation will also require CADx tools that seamlessly integrate the endoscopic workflow, without the need for image enhancement or magnification. In addition, broad CADx adoption will likely depend on innovations in reimbursement models (currently, pathology fees are an important revenue stream for many gastroenterology practices) and clarification around the medical-legal concerns raised by leaving polyp in situ or discarding resected polyps after CADx-supported diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence Improving the Quality of Colonoscopy Technique (Computer-Aided Quality Assessment) Missed adenomas during colonoscopy can result from \u201ccognitive errors\u201d when the endoscopist fails to recognize adenomas that are visualized on the screen, or \u201cexposure errors\u201d due to blind spots and incomplete mucosal exposure that can be related to the withdrawal speed during colonoscopy, endoscopist skill, degree of bowel cleansing, and other factors. Current CADe systems do not address exposure errors during colonoscopy. Studies indicate that higher-quality colonoscopy withdrawal technique is associated with a lower miss rate for adenomas and 4 complementary skills contribute to higher inspection quality to overcome exposure errors: fold examination, mucosal cleaning, luminal distension, and adequacy of time spent viewing. 24 Developments in computer-aided techniques are starting to focus on measures to overcome exposure errors. These tools can be defined as computer-aided quality-assessment systems and represent a third group of computer-aided techniques in colonoscopy along with CADe and CADx. Meticulous colonic-fold examination is a particularly critical determinant of whether or not polyps appear in the field of view. 25 Although physical devices like distal attachment caps may play a critical role in improving fold examination, AI systems to support quality control of fold examination are also now being investigated. Liu and colleagues 26 developed and studied an AI-based system for measuring fold evaluation quality (FEQ). One hundred and three consecutive colonoscopies performed by 11 colonoscopists were collected for evaluation. Three experts graded the FEQ of each colonoscopy, after which the recorded colonoscopies were evaluated by the AI system. The system was assessed by correlating its FEQ evaluation against expert scoring, historical ADR, and withdrawal time of each colonoscopist. The AI system\u2019s evaluations of the FEQ of each endoscopist were significantly correlated with expert scores, historical ADR, and withdrawal time. For colonoscopies performed by colonoscopists with previously low ADRs (<25%), AI assistance significantly improved the FEQ, evaluated by both the AI system and experts. Other promising computer-aided quality assessment technologies include withdrawal \u201cspeedometers,\u201d technology to \u201cpaint\u201d the colon surface on a graphical representation of the colon, and systems that score the level of adequate mucosal exposure during colonoscopy. 27 In the future, these types of AI-based systems may support trainees and lower-performing endoscopists to reduce exposure errors and, more broadly, may empower physician practices and hospital systems with more nuanced and actionable data on an array of factors that contribute to colonoscopy quality. Challenges and Future Directions Several CADe systems have become commercially available in the United States and across the world in the last several years, but despite the robust early data supporting a role for CADe in adenoma detection, clinical adoption has been slower than expected. Rex and colleagues 28 have proposed several contributing potential factors. First, there is a long history of adjunctive polyp detection devices that have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but then failed to reach widespread use. Examples include ultrawide angle endoscopy systems, and distal attachments or hoods that can flatten folds on withdrawal. The limited adoption of this entire category suggests that colonoscopists attach a relatively low price point to the value of increasing detection gains produced by \u201cadd-on\u201d devices. Thus far, there is no separate reimbursement for CADe or other polyp-detection devices, and physicians are not sold on the concept that reimbursement from a higher number of polypectomies and future increased procedure volume (owing to shorter surveillance intervals) might offset the cost of these devices. A second factor that may contribute to slow CADe adoption is that the technology is not yet integrated directly into endoscopes or video processors. This is a substantial change from previous electronic enhancements, like high-definition video, digital chromoendoscopy, and magnification, all of which have been integrated as part of newer endoscope packages as these technologies have become available. The current iteration of CADe as a separate, add-on digital device introduces an additional layer of complexity and cost that may seem daunting for some endoscopy units. A third factor in the CADe adoption curve, as discussed earlier, is the distraction and aggravation that some endoscopists have reported with CADe false positives. This performance issue is already being mitigated by newer iterations of CADe algorithms, but nonetheless early frustration may discourage physicians from considering AI adoption in the future. Overall, CADe and CADx diagnosis are just the first of a wave of AI tools that will support gastrointestinal endoscopic practice. The functionality of AI for colonoscopy will rapidly expand toward computer-aided quality assessment and AI automated completion of procedures notes. These and other innovative AI tools are moving along various stages of the developmental and regulatory pathway. Eventually, we predict an AI suite of tools for colonoscopy will seem indispensable, as a powerful adjunct to support safe and efficient clinical practice. AI tools that improve colonoscopy quality may become more accepted, and perhaps demanded, by payors, administrators, and possibly even by well-informed patients who want to ensure the highest-quality examination of their colon. Beyond the immediate applications of AI for colonoscopy, AI has also revealed itself as a powerful lens through which to explore insights into how humans perform endoscopy, with all our inherent strengths and limitations. As technological innovation progresses, we can expect that the future for AI in endoscopy will be a hybrid model, where the unique capabilities of physicians and our AI tools will be seamlessly intertwined to optimize patient care.

A CNN is trained to discern consistent patterns in pre-RT computed tomography images and the administered RT doses, and to associate these patterns with post-RT toxicity manifestation. The properties of the CNN are then analyzed to identify anatomical regions, the sparing of which significantly correlates with a reduction in toxicity risk. This analysis culminates in the creation of a toxicity risk map for the liver area.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is developing rapidly and has found widespread applications in medicine, especially radiotherapy. This paper provides a brief overview of AI applications in radiotherapy, and highlights the research directions of AI that can potentially make significant impacts and relevant ongoing research works in these directions. Challenging issues related to the clinical applications of AI, such as robustness and interpretability of AI models, are also discussed. The future research directions of AI in the field of medical physics and radiotherapy are highlighted. Keywords Artificial intelligence Radiotherapy Medical physics 1 Introduction In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing medical science and healthcare. 1 , 2 The deep learning applications in radiation oncology and medical physics appeared in the 2016 Annual Meeting of American Association of Physicists in Medicine. 3 , 4 Since the pioneering applications of deep learning in radiation therapy in 2016 and 2017 by the Stanford group, 3-8 there has been surging interest in the applications of AI in radiation oncology. 9-11 Indeed, in the area of medical physics and radiation oncology, data-driven solutions are quickly evolving and promise to change our practice. The implication of AI to our field is enormous and all indications suggest that AI will transform the ways that many tasks are done in the clinic. The clinical workflow of radiation therapy is shown in Fig. 1 . In general, the process includes imaging simulation, contouring, treatment planning, quality assurance (QA), treatment delivery, and follow-up assessment. In each of the steps, there exist multiple difficult decisions to be made and the decision-making process can be either manual or automatic with AI assistance. In this paper, we provide an overview of the applications of AI in radiation oncology and medical physics. We also discuss the potential clinical benefits and challenges of AI-based approaches. 2 AI in Medical Physics and Radiation Oncology 2.1 AI for target delineation and organ segmentation Clinically, one of the important tasks is for radiation oncologists to decide on the volume of the tumor target. 12 , 13 Because the boundary between normal and tumor tissues in the images can be unclear or blurred for various reasons, it is sometimes difficult for radiation oncologists to determine the clinical target volume (CTV) and decide on how much margin to include for treatment planning. Additionally, the delineations of organs at risk (OARs) are also problematic as the process is labor intensive and time consuming. 5 , 13 Automated segmentation of OARs would greatly improve the efficiency and operator dependency of the process. Some studies involving AI for target delineation and organ segmentation are summarized in Table 1 . Technically, segmentation is the process of clustering an image into several coherent sub-regions according to the extracted features and classifying each sub-region into one of the pre-determined classes. Segmentation techniques are divided into supervised and unsupervised techniques. The former approach incorporates prior knowledge about the image processing task through training samples. 22 The latter relies on the intensity or gradient analysis of the image via various strategies such as thresholding, graph cut, edge detection, and deformation, to delineate the boundaries of the target object in the image. With the advances in deep learning techniques, significant progress has been made in image segmentation. Noteworthy, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for the semantic segmentation of natural images. 23-25 For example, the pioneer studies of Men et al, 14 , 15 applied fully connected network (FCN) for computed tomography (CT), CTV and OARs segmentation of rectal cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer. They claimed that the deep learning models could complete the segmentation within one minute, facilitating radiotherapy workflow while improving the contouring consistency. In addition to CT, promising results were also achieved on other imaging modalities, including magnetic resonancing imaging (MRI) of various contrasts 16 , 26 and positron emission tomography (PET). 17 , 18 Readers are recommended for the seminal paper of Litjens et al., 27 which reviewed the major concepts of deep learning and over 300 contributions to medical image analysis including image classification, object detection, segmentation, registration and other tasks per application area: neuro, retinal, pulmonary, digital pathology, breast, cardiac, abdominal, musculoskeletal. In addition, Seo et al. 13 reviewed the applications of machine learning techniques, including deep learning, 7\u201312 kernel support vector machines (SVMs), Markov random fields (MRFs), random forests (RFs), etc., in medical image segmentation only. In summary, AI-assisted target delineation and organ segmentation showed great potential in improving clinical efficiency and consistency. However, there are also challenges of such method that require future work of the community. First, the scarcity and inconsistency of annotated data may hinder the development of AI models. Preparing large training dataset is not only labor-intensive, but also vulnerable to inter-physician variability. Building benchmark datasets from multiple clinical centers might be a solution to standardizing the model development and performance. Second, AI models usually predict target definition based on a single image modality, while in the clinic physicians usually combine the information from several image modalities. Integrating anatomical and functional images in AI models can also be an interesting research topic for the community. 2.2 AI for image registration Image registration is a common tool in the clinic and has been widely applied in various tasks, including motion tracking and modeling, 28 segmentation, 29 image-guided treatment, 30 and adaptive radiation therapy. 31 Despite those promising applications, conventional image registration, especially deformable image registration (DIR), replies on iterative optimization algorithms and can take hours for an accurate registration. 32 AI-assisted image registration takes a single forward calculation in implementation, which greatly accelerates the progress. Some studies involving AI for image registration are summarized in Table 2 . Specifically, AI in image registration can be classified into three major categories: deep iterative registration models, supervised registration models, and unsupervised registration models. 52 For deep iterative registration models, CNNs are utilized to replace conventional intensity-based cost function, which is robust to image artifacts and capable of capturing underlying image features. For example, Simonovsky et al. 33 trained a CNN model to distinguish whether two images were well-aligned, and then replaced the intensity-based cost function in brain MRI registration with the CNN model, resulting in significantly improved accuracy. For supervised registration models, they follow the straightforward idea of AI, which utilizes annotated data for training. However, as ground truth deformation is usually not available, the supervision of AI models can also sometimes be artificial, indirect, or a mixture of multiple components. For example, Teng et al. 37 developed a patch-based CNN model for lung 4D-CT and 4D-cone-beam computed tomography (4D-CBCT) registration, whose reference deformations were from VelocityAI (Varian). To overcome the shortage and inaccuracy of reference deformations, Sokooti et al. 38 , 40 trained AI models with artificially generated deformations and achieved comparable accuracy with conventional methods across multiple datasets. As for indirect supervisions, Li et al. 41 developed hybrid CNNs that predicts image segmentation and registration together, while the segmentation can in turn aid the registration process. In addition, Fan et al. 42 utilized a mixture of reference deformation and image similarity as supervision, achieving up to a 4% higher average Dice score and more than 30 times faster implementation speed compared with conventional methods like SyN. Unsupervised registration models omitted the time-consuming data preparation process and showed a more convenient way for registration model training. For example, Balakrishnan et al. 32 trained a U-Net-like model for brain MRI registration using intensity-based loss functions, including mean square error and normalized cross-correlation, and achieved comparable Dice score with conventional methods like Syn and NiftyReg, but with more than 20,000 times faster implementation with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration. However, without the guidance of reference deformations, the regularization of the deep learning model could be challenging and folding voxels might be more than those in conventional methods if inappropriate loss functions were chosen. In summary, AI-assisted models can greatly accelerate the implementation of image registration while keeping comparable or even better accuracy. However, there also remains several challenges that need to be addressed. First, shortage of high-quality training data is always a challenge for AI models, and this is even more severe for registration models since ground truth deformation is usually not available. Second, the plausibility of the deformation is another challenge. Deformation regularization is usually just smoothness, which may not be enough for sliding motions. Some conventional methods have tried to solve this, 53 but few AI-assisted models touched this topic. Further research on these is needed to facilitate the AI-assisted registration model development and implementation. 2.3 Deep learning-based image reconstruction Deep learning is used to extract the features difficult to find by human beings and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many imaging tasks. Reconstruction of images (CT, MRI, PET, and so forth) can be improved by deep learning. For example, Zhu et al. developed a deep learning model named AUTOMAP for image reconstruction from k-space. 54 Their findings indicate that their model outperformed conventional reconstruction methods, including compressed sensing, by achieving a more than twice higher signal-to-noise ratio, halving the root mean squared error, and exhibiting fewer artifacts. In current image reconstruction, the sensory or measurement data are converted to an image by model-based method or analytical inversion. For CT imaging, for example, one measures 800 to 1 000 projections from different directions and then performs the reconstruction. With deep learning, we are provided with a wonderful framework to leverage prior patient data for sparse and artifacts-free CT imaging. 55-58 Some studies involving AI for image reconstruction were summarized in Table 3 . In deep learning-based sparse image reconstruction, the demand for measurement data can be reduced substantially without compromising the quality of resultant images. Different from the conventional image reconstruction method, in which every patient is a new patient with the image reconstruction starting from the very beginning without consideration of prior imaging data, the information extracted from prior data to facilitate the imaging of a new patient is considered. In this way, high-quality imaging with fewer measurements become possible. Recently, Shen, Zhao and Xing 58 have developed a novel deep neural network for ultra-sparse CT image reconstruction. They demonstrated the feasibility of CT imaging by using a single projection. They firstly proposed a deep learning model to generate volumetric tomographic X-ray images from a single projection view for upper-abdomen, lung and head-and-neck, as shown in Fig. 2 . 58 Then they proposed a geometry-informed deep learning framework integrating geometric priors of the imaging system which is essential to enhance the performance. 58 A team at Stanford Radiology developed an artificial intelligence-enabled PET imaging technique to synthesize standard-dose amyloid PET images of high quality from ultra-low dose PET images. The synthesized images have similar accuracy (around 90%) for amyloid status to intrareader reproducibility of full-dose images, 61 , 62 which may represent a significant step forward in PET imaging with multiple-fold reduction of the radionuclide tracers. In summary, deep learning models have achieved great successes in image reconstruction, especially in the efficiency. However, reconstruction models also face similar challenges as other models. First, models trained on data from a single or a few medical centers may not be generalizable to other centers, and re-training for each center can be time- and resource-consuming. Recently, federated learning has been introduced to medical imaging, 63 which is promising for model development in small medical centers. Second, the reliability of reconstruction models needs thorough evaluation. Although image details can be reconstructed by AI models, unrealistic or extra structures sometimes are also generated. Turing test might be a good way to evaluation the models before applications. 64 , 65 2.4 AI for dose prediction and automated treatment planning While numerous clinical studies have clearly shown the significant benefit of tumor dose escalation and hypofractionation, how to efficiently deliver a tumoricidal radiation dose to the tumor without increasing the radiation toxicity remains to be the single most significant challenge in radiation oncology. Treatment planning is an important step in radiation therapy and critically determines the quality of treatment. Currently, the clinical treatment planning process is rather tedious and labor-intensive, yet has no guarantee of generating truly optimal treatment plans. The deficiencies in treatment planning are caused by the involvement of multiple model parameters, which must be determined via manual trial-and-error as their influence on the final dose distribution is patient-dependent and not known until optimization is done. Thus, treatment planning remains to be one of the most labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks in current RT practice, with the quality of the final plan depending heavily on the planner's training and skills. A more reliable, faster and more autonomous planning approach is urgently needed to greatly improve the safety, quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of radiation therapy. Some studies involving AI for dose prediction and automated treatment planning were summarized in Table 4 . AI-augmented autonomous treatment planning promises to mitigate the bottleneck to maximize the therapeutic ratio of modern radiation therapy. Since the initial work on deep learning-based intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose prediction by Mardani et al., 3 many attempts have been made to automate treatment planning (Fig. 3 ). 66-68 , 71 , 72 Technically, there are a number of important problems that must be resolved before the deep learning-based techniques can be employed to facilitate clinical treatment. These include, for example, 1) development and clinical implementation of AI-based dose prediction with the incorporation of prior clinical knowledge. Zhao et al. proposed a dose distribution prediction model integrating anatomic features and dosimetric features based on deep learning method, as shown in Fig. 3 66 , 67 ; 2) development of computer algorithm to mimic operations of a human planner to automatically update treatment plan parameters. One of the algorithm frameworks is shown in Fig. 4 71 ; 3) implementation of deep learning-based dose calculation to speed up the planning process, as shown in Fig. 5 . 69 , 70 AI-augmented treatment planning will not only speed up the treatment planning process, but also improve the quality of treatment plans, and help to standardize the treatment planning procedure. Several specific challenges still remain for AI-augmented treatment planning. First, the models usually treat the dose prediction to each anatomical structures as separate tasks and neglect the relationship between maximizing target dose and minimizing OAR doses. 73 , 74 Second, some studies focused on dose map prediction only, yet did not cover the delivery parameters, including beam angles and fluencies. Research to address these tasks are therefore encouraged. 2.5 Deep learning-augmented image guidance Another important example of AI is to provide better image guidance tools for radiation therapy, where nearly real-time information about the tumor target as well as patient setup is necessary to achieve accurate beam targeting. Recent advances in radiotherapy techniques, including volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), IMRT, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), provide effective ways to generate steep dose distributions at the target boundary while sparing the healthy issues. However, these steep dose distributions call for stringent requirements for enhanced target positioning. Radiation treatment machine systems with image guidance have been routinely used in clinical practice. 75-82 Deep learning enables learning semantic features and understanding complex relationships from data. 83 This has greatly augmented the applications of AI in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). Zhao et al. employed deep learning to localize the prostate target on kV X-ray images, as shown in Fig. 6 . 10 Differences between the predicted target positions and their actual positions are 1.58\u00b10.43 mm, 1.64\u00b10.43 mm, and 1.67\u00b10.36 mm in anterior-posterior, lateral, and oblique directions for prostate tumor, 10 , 84 , 85 which demonstrated highly accurate, markerless prostate localization based on deep learning are achievable. AI also provides better solutions to motion management 86-88 and quality assurance 89-97 in radiation therapy. Real-time target tracking requires a latency from motion to treatment response of less than 500 ms, 98 and abovementioned studies all satisfied this criterion. However, there are more potential latencies that have to be considered. For example, although only a single slice was needed in some studies, image reconstruction of that slice can still take a while. Besides, the transfer of raw data from the image scanner to the workstation for processing is also a non-negligible component. Prospective studies including the entire treatment process is therefore encouraged for evaluation. 2.6 Deep learning-based outcome prediction Deep learning-based process prediction models gained much popularity and led to breakthrough results in a variety of applications. Some studies involving AI for outcome prediction were summarized in Table 5 . Ibragimov et al. 99 predicted the patient survival and local progression after stereotactic body radiation therapy using 3D dose analysis based on deep learning. Moreover, they proposed a deep learning based model to recognize the toxicity risk map for the abdominal areas, as shown in Fig. 7 . 100 Jean-Emmanuel et al. 101 provided an explainable prediction of the 10-year death rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) using XGBoost python package with tumor features, and patients\u2019 medical and demographic information. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of this model was 0.84\u00b10.04 and the accuracy was 0.83\u00b10.04. Liu et al. 102 developed an individualized deep-learning based model by using the whole dose information contained in dose-volume histograms (DVHs) instead of some isolated index, like V20, V40, etc., to predict lymphopenia, which takes into account the isodose distribution. With the increasing availability of high-quality clinical data and state-of-the-art deep learning infrastructure, we anticipate that exciting and clinically useful models will be readily available in the near future. Despite the promising future, some challenges need to be addressed before the clinical implementation of those models. First, the prediction is usually discrete, like Grade I, II, III, etc. However, treatment response or toxicity are always more complex than the discrete grades. 103 Second, clinical data are inherently multi-modality, including medical images, treatment plans, patients\u2019 physiological parameters, and even patients\u2019 life habits. Current models mostly focus on medical images and treatment plans, which might lose useful information for prediction. 2.7 Guidelines for development and clinical trials of AI Recently, it has become increasingly important to prospectively assess the impact of interventions involving artificial intelligence on health outcomes. The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence (SPIRIT-AI) extension 104 is a new guideline for reporting clinical trial protocols to evaluate the AI component interventions. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence (CONSORT-AI) extension 105 is a new guideline for reporting clinical trials used to evaluate an AI component intervention. A staged consensus process including a literature review and expert consultation was used for the development of both guidelines. Clear descriptions of AI intervention were recommended, including instructions and skills for using, the integrated setting, input and output data handling, the human-AI interaction, and error case analysis. They aimed to increase the transparency and completeness of clinical trials of AI interventions. Luo et al. 106 proposed a set of guidelines for the use of machine learning predictive models in clinical settings, including a reporting item list and practical steps to develop predictive models. They aimed to enable correct application and consistent reporting of machine learning models in clinical settings. Most of the guidelines focus on data privacy and ethics. 107-110 Since we are mainly interested in the development of artificial intelligence tools and the conduct of clinical trials in clinical settings, we will not go into details. 3 Conclusions AI has made remarkable progress in the past decade. It has recently shown expert-level accuracy in various applications and in improving the clinical gain and therapeutic ratio. Deep learning represents one of the most important advances in the history of radiation oncology. The technique holds significant potential to revolutionize radiation oncology research and practice. Despite all the promises, potential pitfalls exist with the current implementation. Noteworthy, AI is still largely a black box with little interpretability, which limits its utility, especially in the area of healthcare. The development of interpretable AI is of paramount importance for the widespread adaptation of AI in healthcare.

Department of Psychology University of Bologna Piazza Aldo Moro Cesena 90 \u2013 47521 Italy Handling Editor: Paul Kirschner Despite the significant emphasis placed on incorporating 21st century skills into the educational framework, particularly at the primary level, recent scholarly works indicate considerable variation in the implementation of these skills across different countries and regions, suggesting a demand for further research specifically focusing on primary education. The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context. The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts.

Emerging technologies could be key to understanding and overcoming such challenges but are simultaneously perceived as threats to how we live together in a different social context 1 1 https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/digcomp/digcomp-framework_en . Artificial intelligence (AI), for example, has accelerated the development of medical breakthroughs, but the threats to humanity are well known if AI is left unchecked, for example AI used in educational or vocational training, that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone's life (e.g., scoring of exams). In this regard, EU proposed a regulation on AI 2 2 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-approach-artificial-intelligence. and the regulatory framework on artificial intelligence. 3 3 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai. The proposed AI regulations are a first step in the direction to a trustworthy AI. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems have to treat in a more cautious way to avoid undesirable outcomes. Implementing AI algorithms in the field of learning require to the developers consider various factors, ranging from the sensitivity of the data utilized for training the algorithms to the reliability and trustworthiness of these algorithms. In line with this trajectory, a novel and burgeoning field of research known as Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged. The primary aim of researchers in this field is to furnish comprehensive explanations and interpretations for the decision-making processes employed by AI systems (Gohel, Singh, & Mohanty, 2021). Nevertheless, it is essential to note that examining how these AI systems function in real-world contexts and assessing their alignment with the intended purposes under expert supervision is another crucial perspective that merits significant attention by researchers and practitioners in the field (Orsoni, P\u00f6gelt, et al., 2023). These challenges continue yet learning and working online has sustained societies during a pandemic, overcoming time and space limits and barriers. Artificial Intelligence systems will continue to have a tremendous impact on how we address major challenges, as well as how we live our daily lives and learn, changing our behavior (Gillath et al., 2021). Thus, schools need to provide an appropriate education in a ubiquitously digitalized world and within an accordingly complex and changing career landscape. Some research has highlighted that the worker of the future (student of today) is expected to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork since these qualities have significant impacts on the development of innovation (and the use of AI systems) (Chen, Chen, & Lin, 2020; Goksel & Bozkurt, 2019). Hence, current, and future generation of workers need to be prepared for the functional use of emerging technologies (i.e., a use that sustains personal and social development, but also the development of knowledge and skills), preventing the risks of the dysfunctional one (i.e., a use that doesn't sustain human development and could also determine problems in many aspects of human life 4 4 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai. ). Using and reflecting on AI in schools, often subsumed as \u201cdigitalization of education\u201d, is neither systematically addressed in the European educational context, nor is it subject of standardized let alone technology-enhanced, automatized assessment, which would provide instant feedback to stakeholders such as (head) teachers, parents, school boards, and policymakers. An important reflection follows from the ethical point of view about what behaviors can or cannot develop such a system (e.g., schools), especially now in which those behaviors have an impact on individuals (Langer & Landers, 2021). For these reasons, the European Union has proposed guidelines and ethics to guide the interaction between humans and the AI system. The goal is to ensure that people develop trust towards this technology and can use it feeling safe, including in school contexts. To all that has been said so far, we must add the robot side which, currently, is the ideal match for artificial intelligence. Considering the perspective of Developmental Robotics, if we want to create artificial intelligence systems that expand following the same dynamics and phases of human development, it is necessary to equip them with a body side that allows them to build knowledge based on environmental interaction. Without the physical-social environment with which to interact, it would be impossible to hypothesize that artificial intelligence could follow, in its development, the dynamics of the human one. For example, an interesting aspect to consider is the use of AI systems, applied to robotics, to create robots sustaining human development in knowledge and skills. Interacting with humans in different periods of development, AI robots could adapt their interactive behavior to act in the human zone of proximal development. This Vygotskian concept defines humans' development potential when they operate with more experienced partners than alone. Studies building on socio-cognitive conflict (Benvenuti & Mazzoni, 2020; Mazzoni & Benvenuti, 2015) have also highlighted the importance of interactions and, particularly, the relevance of sharing different points of view and negotiating them to join more advanced solutions in complex tasks. These studies, together with those conducted in the field of divergent thinking, social creativity, and networked flow dynamics, advanced a perspective of robot/AI systems that evolve in a way that could sustain human cognitive development, improving the human knowledge and skills in the same way, or in a better way, than a human partner could do. In the workplace, robots can prevent humans from many heavy and tiring activities, safeguarding their physical and mental health. There are currently many experiences with promising results in which robots are used for the education of children, but there is a lack of a shared perspective and plan on what skills should be developed in the school environment to cope with and use AI in educational contexts. This perspective and reflective paper brings together different views and concepts of developmental and educational psychology (starting from a literature review) but also explores more technical fields to offer a perspective on the lines of research that could be taken to offer tools to teachers and students, to prepare them for the challenges of the future (and for the future labor market). 2 State of the art In response to the pandemic emergency, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have highlighted their potential in many fields, particularly in educational contexts. On the one hand, ICT-enabled distance learning and classes were carried on without interruption; on the other, the isolation of pupils, particularly of adolescents, was undoubtedly a negative influence on the ICT-enhanced educational context. The lack of social interactions and motivation leads to feelings of loneliness and dejection (Martisone et al., 2022). Additionally, it strongly limited the ability to learn in a social context. This indicates a clear need to exploit novel technologies to promote a way of learning that is grounded in interactions and sociality. From a piagetian constructivist perspective (Piaget, 1962; Ackerman, 2001), the process of understanding the world is the result of the relationship established between a thinking and acting subject and the object of his own experience. In addition, Papert (1980; 1993) underlined the importance of technological artifacts in learning, not as supporting this process but as in simulating reality. From Papert's point of view, knowledge cannot simply be transmitted as it is from one person to another, but each subject reconstructs information in a personal and original way. According to this, the use of technological devices (e.g., computers, tablets, and robots) represents an effective method for building knowledge, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge to practice. Even more, the use of a physical artifact (e.g., a robot tutor) determines an effective learning process as it makes students reflect on the knowledge they possess and how to apply it to the reality on which they are acting (Mubin, Stevens, Shahid, Al Mahmud, & Dong, 2013). In his researches and works Papert highlights how the use of robotics kits, far from transmitting computer skills, generates curiosity and stimulates creativity and motivation to learn, allowing one to build and enter in touch with powerful new ideas (Papert, 1980, 1993). Moreover, following the idea that learning is an active process based on experience and that social interactions can facilitate it, learners might make understanding more effective by working together. This means that technological innovation in education should be able to expand teachers/learners' opportunities for collaborative interaction and let them explore new strategies for teaching/learning (Braun, M\u00e4rz, Mertens, & Braun, 2020). Moreover, schools need to provide an appropriate education in a ubiquitously digitalized world within complex and changing training needs and career landscapes. The actual digital transformation is deeply changing most human sectors and the importance of transversal knowledge, skills, and competencies training is growing both in the labor market and as essential abilities for participating in European society. It has been highlighted that the citizens of the future are expected to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork since these qualities have a significant impact on the development of innovation (Trilling & Fadel, 2009). Communication, cooperation, and problem-solving are, almost by definition, the future skills demanded. Together with ICT literacy, content creation abilities and safety constitute the so-called 21st-century skills (Ferrari, Punie, & Redecker, 2012). Novel technological tools are key for the construction of 21st-century skills, but how can they develop uniformly for all students in educational contexts? This can be better understood within the Activity Theory approach applied to an education system (Batiibwe, 2019; Engestr\u00f6m, 2014; Zhang & Bai, 2005), in which emerging technologies mediate the relationship between the actors and the knowledge construction. A strong tenet of Activity Theory is that cognitive development and learning happen first at the social level, thanks to dynamics such as interaction, points of view sharing, socio-cognitive conflict dynamics, and negotiation, and then, it is interiorized by individuals (Fig. 1 ) (see Fig. 2). Contradictions (e.g., the use of digital technologies and distance education during the pandemic situation) are the motor of change, in as much as needs go beyond the solutions adopted to date and promote the so-called \u201clearning by expanding\u201d (Engestr\u00f6m, 2015) based on Piagetian processes of assimilation and accommodation, to find a new balance in the system (e.g., schools). In this panorama, European Union addressed new strategy for high quality, inclusive, and future-oriented education, aiming to \u201ccontributing to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their actions (Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union Article 165)\u201d. 5 5 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/nl/MEMO_17_1402. Despite this, the use of emerging technologies in schools and educational context, often subsumed as \u201cdigitalization of education\u201d, is not \u201cequally addressed\u201d in Europe, as deepen outline in PISA-OECD data. 6 6 https://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/. In this regard, building on promising approaches to learning analytics, progress in this area is bound to the definition of recommendations and methodological approaches that will guide teachers to develop didactic and educational activities based on technological tools (e.g., educational robotics, CT platforms, etc.) and support the schools\u2019 journey towards digital readiness. For all these reasons, following the recommendation of the European Commission's Digital Education Action Plan (2021\u20132027), 7 7 https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan. this paper supports the fostering of the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem, and encourages teachers in promoting 21st-century skills through digitalization (e.g. the use of technologies and robot tutor) during their didactic activities, particularly proposing ideas that can favor the development of those skills that were particularly addressed as fundamental: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking. Two principal questions guide this perspective paper: a) how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and b) how Artificial Intelligence can be an aid instrument to teachers to foster creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts. 3 Methods To better understand how to start building shared tools to develop the skills described above, starting from the EU indications, we addressed a review of the existing literature. This work was arranged using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol (Moher et al., 2015). We pursued a systematic literature search across three academic databases (PsycINFO, Scopus, and WOS) searching for keywords \u2018Artificial Intelligence AND Problem Solving OR Critical Thinking OR Creativity OR Computational Thinking AND (Education OR School OR Learning OR Teaching OR Classroom OR Education system). During the revision process, we filtered only articles, reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published in English in the last five years (2018\u20132023), we excluded papers published before 2018, books, chapters book, commentary, keynote presentations, panel discussions, dissertations, work-in-progress articles and works that were not conducted within the context of learning, and education. The revision has been conducted by using Rayyan software (Ouzzani, Hammady, Fedorowicz, & Elmagarmid, 2016). Additional records have been found by using the software Connected Papers (Tarnavsky Eitan, Smolyansky, & Knaan Harpaz, 2020). 95 studies have been established as eligible for further investigation. 917 have been evaluated as duplicates, and then excluded in the next steps. 822 articles were excluded after title screening. The remaining 83 were processed for abstract and full text evaluation. After that, only 20 articles were considered relevant. Moreover, we carried out a bibliographic investigation from some recent meta-analysis and perspective articles by using the Software Connected Papers (Connected Papers, s.d.), then, we mainly focused on those articles found aiming to suggest educational model indication for developing Critical Thinking, Problem Solving and Creativity using AI and Computational Thinking (Alam, 2022; Bocconi et al., 2022; Chassignol, Khoroshavin, Klimova, & Bilyatdinova, 2018; Van Laar, van Deursen, van Dijk, & de Haan, 2020). The development of these skills is also an important issue of the Digital Education Action Plan 2021\u20132027 of the European Commission, where quality Computing Education is addressed as a key element under the priority \u201cEnhancing digital skills and competencies for the digital transformation\u201d. Relevant to this work is digital competence, which concerns the responsible use of digital technologies for learning, at work, and participation in society. It consists of eight points: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation (including programming), safety (digital well-being and competencies related to cybersecurity), problem-solving and Critical Thinking. In this vision, the skills acquired in one domain could support competencies developed in another. This is the case with the skills related to Critical Thinking, and Creativity, which are embedded throughout the key competencies (Mubin et al., 2013). From this perspective, the necessity to introduce Computer Science (CS) practices, particularly Computational Thinking (CT), coding, and programming already in compulsory education has arisen. Nowadays Critical Thinking, Creativity, collaboration, communication, and CT are the core skills that must be learned by students (Digicomp Framework 8 8 https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/digcomp/digcomp-framework_en. ). This would meet the needs of growing young people that could be creators and not just consumers of technology (Papert, 1993). However, activities that include AI systems that could help teachers and educators to develop didactical activity in schools and educational contexts is still not complete in the literature (and not uniform). In this regard, the following sections (Results of the review) will try to answer to the two review questions, giving a more extensive overview of different activities on how Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, could be foster developed, and implemented with Computational Thinking and AI (with e.g., robot tutor) in educational and didactic teaching. First, the paper will discuss about Computational Thinking, Programming and Coding in Schools\u2019 Curriculum. Second, the connection between Creativity, Computational Thinking and Programming and how to foster it by means of AI, will be analyzed. Finally, will be the turn of Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and their connection to Computational Thinking and Programming, and how to foster them by using AI. 4 Results of the review 4.1 Computational thinking, programming, coding in schools\u2019 curriculum Computational Thinking (CT) has been defined in several works by Wing (2006; 2011; 2017) and nowadays Wing's definition is considered the reference point in the discussion on CT. To Wing, \u201cComputational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution(s) in such a way that a computer \u2013 human or machine \u2013 can effectively carry out\u201d (Wing, 2017). Then, CT is a set of concepts and skills involving abstraction, algorithmic thinking, automation, decomposition, debugging, and generalization (Bocconi, Chioccariello, Dettori, Ferrari, & Engelhardt, 2016; Bocconi et al., 2022). These skills are suitable in compulsory education, allowing students to move beyond operable and technical skills, creating problem solvers than just beneficiaries of the technology, developing creativity, and problem-solving capabilities (Yadav, Mayfield, Zhou, & Hambrusch, 2014). Moreover, CT allows approaching problem-solving in a manner that results in solutions that can be reusable in different contexts (Shute, Sun, & Asbell-clarke, 2017). One of the constituents of CT is programming (Bocconi et al., 2016; Bocconi et al., 2022). We could define programming as the activity of analyzing a problem, designing a solution, and implementing it. This has been indicated by DigComp, the European framework for digital competencies, as one of the constituents for EU citizens (Ferrari, Punie, & Bre, 2013). Differently, coding is the step of implementing solutions in a particular programming language. According to Bers et al. (2019), \u201ccoding is a playground\u201d, a new literacy for the 21st century, and a new language for children. Through coding, children can learn to code via fun, play, and creativity (Bers et al., 2019). Literature suggests programming as an efficient framework for fostering CT skills (Sun, Hu, & Zhou, 2022; Angeli & Giannakos, 2020). In recent years, computational thinking and programming/coding are a reality of compulsory education in different EU countries (Bers et al., 2019; Bocconi et al., 2016; Bocconi et al., 2022). The United Kingdom, in 2013, has incorporated computer science in the early years of its school curriculum (National curriculum in England: primary curriculum, 2013). Moreover, an interesting report promoted and funded by the Nordic@BETT2018 Steering Group (Bocconi, Chioccariello, & Earp, 2018), e.g., shows that in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, CT and programming are already included in the primary and secondary schools\u2019 curricula (but not all over Europe, specifically in the south), sometimes as transversal competencies and within existing subject matter (e.g., in Finland and Sweden) or as a new (elective) subject (e.g., in Denmark and Norway). A deep reading of the report highlights the relevance of two key transversal competencies to foster computational thinking and programming in compulsory schools: critical thinking and creativity (Bocconi et al., 2018). 4.2 Creativity and its connection to computational thinking and programming and how to foster it by using AI Creativity consists of a core skill for promoting personal growth (Papadakis & Kalogiannakis, 2019) and is embedded throughout the key competencies for lifelong learning (Mazzoni, Benvenuti, & Orsoni, 2022). However, there is still debate about what is creativity. Over the years, researchers developed different conceptualizations and definitions of this term, even if it is possible to find a certain consensus in the simplest definition of creativity. Kaufman & Gl\u0103veanu (2019) refer to creativity as something both new and task appropriate. In addition, it is possible to focus on three mental operations that underlie creativity (Antonietti & Molteni, 2014). The first one is related to broadening the mental field, linked to the subject's ability to conceive unique and different ideas e.g. divergent thinking concept (Guilford, 1950), to generate solutions of which at least one survives the judgment (Johnson-Laird, 1998), or the subject's capability of holding a mental wealth of information able to enhance the probability to find elements related to each other for creating something new. In the second mental operation, creativity allows connecting usually conceived antithetical and distant mental fields (Rothenberg, 1979). Lastly, about the third mental operation, a creative act is present when there is a reorganization of the mental field. Only in recent years, creativity has been embraced as a relevant element in computer science for its importance in supplying motivation and interest in the field, but also in improving performance and knowledge acquisition (Israel-Fishelson & Hershkovitz, 2022). Although the literature suggests a bidirectional link between creativity, computer science, and CT, in this work we mainly focus on how creativity can influence CT. Moreover, we present a possible perspective in which AI has been implemented to improve the creativity of participants. Israel-Fishelson and Hershkovitz (2022) highlighted as creativity may facilitate the resolution of algorithmic problems, the development of computational products, and new knowledge. Liu and Lu (2002) found how standardized creativity tests allow for prediction creativity in solving programming problems among undergraduate students. Similar results have been found in the work of Perez-Poch, Gonz\u00e1lez, and L\u00f3pez (2016). The authors found a significant positive correlation between the levels of creativity and programming skills among engineering students. In detail, a high level of creativity predicted achieving excellence in programming. These results have been corroborated by Hodgets and colleagues (2013). The idea behind this work was to improve CT by fostering creative thinking. Creative thinking is personalized thinking leading to creative results (Hodges et al., 2013). They found that the implementation of creative thinking exercises in CS courses improved computational knowledge and skills (Miller et al., 2013). In general, these pieces of evidence suggest a relevant role of creativity and give value to its integration into compulsory education that would foster CT and programming skills. Thus, it is important to explore whether and how Artificial Intelligence can be a valuable tool in fostering human creativity, and consequently CT. The idea of AI helping humans to achieve better creative performances is undoubtedly fascinating. The branch of Computer Science that deals with this aspect is called computational creativity. Wingstr\u00f6m, Hautala, and Lundman (2022), observed how nowadays computational creativity focuses on two lines of research. The first explores the capabilities of AI algorithms to recreate human-level creativity while the second is merging the creativity of humans and AI in a reciprocal course. Concerning co-creativity, Maher, Brady, and Fisher (2013) suggested three roles of computers: 1) as supporters of the human creative process by giving tools and procedures; 2) as enhancers of human creative ability by providing knowledge and promising creative cognition; 3) as generators, by offering to the user, creative elements to interpret, evaluate and integrate as creative products. Unfortunately, the approach to co-creativity is young and most of the co-creative AI is in the arts domains (Wingstr\u00f6m et al., 2022). According to this line, one recent work (Rong, Lian, & Tang, 2022), explored how fine art training based on Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence can enhance the creativity and concentration of middle school students. The study was done by comparing the students' creativity, distraction, and anxiety levels before and after AI and VR course training. The results showed significant improvement in creativity levels (assessed with the \u201cCreative Thinking Test for Middle School Students\u201d), and significantly reduced distraction and anxiety levels. The authors claim that the training proposed can adequately improve students' creativity and concentration, and at the same time, reduce students\u2019 test anxiety. Another work by Liapis, Yannakakis, Alexopoulos, and Lopes (2016), presented a computational approach by using mixed-initiative tools aiming to support and foster human creativity by improving lateral thinking with educational activities. In this work, four mixed-initiative tools or games were presented. The goal of fostering lateral thinking was carried out by the computer supported by AI that proactively contributes to the design process by creating suggestions for the human user to consider. In this perspective, human and computers do affect each other; the action done by the computer reformulate the human's mental associations, but also the action taken by the human constrains the search space of the algorithm, enabling it to focus on specific possible solutions to a problem (Liapis et al., 2016). Authors suggested in their results how this co-creative approach was able to foster human creativity by improving the lateral thinking of humans. Unfortunately, the work considers only qualitative and observational data limiting the generalizability of results. 4.3 Critical thinking, problem solving, their connection to computational thinking and programming, and how to foster them by using AI The other transversal competence considered is critical thinking. Critical thinking is merely the ability to think critically and is a key to individual civic engagement and economic success (Willingham, 2019). As for creativity, there is no general definition for critical thinking, but researchers highlighted some agreement about the characteristics inherent to it, like analysis and synthesis, making judgments, decision-making, drawing warranted conclusions, and generalizations (Buckley, 2012). According to Fagin and colleagues (Fagin, Harper, Baird, Hadfield, & Sward, 2006), three are the key parts of critical thinking: clarity (the ability to understand the information received), accuracy (the ability to investigate the distance between the information and factual reality), and relevance (the ability to evaluate if the information received is pertinent). The suggestion is that critical thinking might be considered a prerequisite to problem-solving (Buckley, 2012). Even if the literature did not deeply explore yet the relationship between critical thinking and CT, an interesting work of Buckley (2012), pointed to a connection between these two forms of thinking. The idea formulated, focused on perceiving a problem as an obstacle. The author claimed that to overcome the obstacle was possible to apply a linear problem-solving strategy or a 3-D problem-solving model. Both models consider critical thinking as a non-algorithmic higher order of thinking that directly affects knowledge acquisition. Then, critical thinking becomes a prerequisite for knowledge acquisition. By using critical thinking, the subject becomes aware of the problem and then the information is extrapolated and critically analyzed. Starting from the relevant knowledge extracted in this way, it is possible to apply CT and then solve the problem. How Artificial Intelligence could be a valuable tool in fostering human critical thinking, and problem-solving? Critical thinking and problem-solving, are the key element in the decision-making process and all these three elements are interconnected to achieve the best solution given a problem (\u00d6zgenel, 2018). Starting from this point, a recent line of research focused on the use of AI and metacognition in the learning process to enhance students' problem-solving capabilities. Metacognition is the ability to think about one's cognition (Cortese, 2022). According to Molin, Haelermans, Cabus, and Groot (2020), students with a higher level of metacognitive skills are mainly prone to self-regulated learning, which is an approach linked to learning where students set their goals, and track, regulate and control actions, cognition, and motivation to achieve these goals. Confidence is the measure by which metacognition is measured in the field of psychology and neuroscience (Cortese, 2022). According to Cortese (2022), is possible to bring together the aspect of confidence with the mathematical formalism of Reinforcement Learning that fits well with the question of how to explain learning and how confidence can affect learning and vice-versa. The focus on metacognition as an element to enhance students\u2019 problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, and how AI can be beneficial for this purpose, has been investigated in a recent work by Callaway et al. (2022). The objective of this work was to improve the planning strategies of students facing different problems. By adopting the Mouselab-MDP paradigm (Callaway, Lieder, Krueger, & Griffiths, 2017), the authors developed an intelligent cognitive tutor that employs metacognitive feedback to teach planning. The idea of metacognitive feedback is to give people feedback on how instead of what they decide to do. The authors based on the theory of metacognitive reinforcement learning developed a system able to discover the optimal cognitive strategies and accelerate metacognitive learning in people by suggesting optimal feedback signals. The presented approach was validated by the authors in six different experiments. The results showed how practicing with this system allowed people to be more effective than traditional methods. In more detail, the group that used the metacognitive feedback showed significantly better results than the other groups (feedback related to action and no feedback). In addition, by applying this method the authors found how improvements were also transferred in new situations, and retained over time (Callaway, 2022). 5 Conclusion To be a citizen of the 21st century requires one to master different skills and competencies to be an effective worker, for personal realization and development. The school and the teachers are the key elements to educating students in this transformation process where computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and the remaining skills are taking a leading role in this even more digitalized world. With this paper we try to propose a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence can be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts. Literature suggests how AI is used in education with different applications like chatbots, intelligent tutoring, automated grading systems, and recommended systems, but its application in the field is still limited compared to others, like medicine and business (Celik, 2022). This aspect is also reflected in this study, where very few articles have been considered eligible for the aim of the article itself. One possible reason has been presented in the work of Celik, Dindar, Muukkonen, and J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 (2022), where there was evidence of the resistance of decision-makers such as teachers, educators, and traditional textbook publishers to the use of AI, but also the knowledge of stakeholders, including students, about AI plays a relevant role in its application. According to this line, Marrone, Taddeo, and Hill (2022) investigated how students perceived AI in fostering creativity in the school context. They found four key factors describing the relationship between AI and creativity: social, affective, technological, and learning. Concerning the affective one, the authors observed an effective response in students based on their degree of familiarity with AI; students who were more familiar with AI concepts or applications reported being more comfortable in using AI technologies compared to the students who were not. 6 Future directions Considering the precious aspects, to be able to implement new technologies, as a driving force for change in teaching activities, it is necessary to keep in mind that the school is a cornerstone for promoting the skills of the 21st century. Even if the dissemination of these technologies and activities in school curricula in Europe is not uniform, it is necessary to continue to disseminate (also through scientific research in this field) the dissemination of techniques that teachers and educators can use. In this regard, our invitation is to follow the indications of the Digital Education Action Plan (2021\u20132027), however enhancing collaboration between schools (e.g., using eTwinning 9 9 https://school-education.ec.europa.eu/en/etwinning. ) throughout Europe in order to reduce the existing gap in the development of skills that currently exists between north and south (Bocconi, et al., 2022). Additionally, evidence has suggested few studies have implemented AI as a method to help students and individuals foster creativity and problem solving (e.g., Alam, 2022; Callaway et al., 2022; Chen, 2020). This depends a lot on finding resources and on the skills that teachers have in being able to use such technological tools. In this regard, it would be necessary to promote lifelong learning, with a view to a lifelong learning programme 10 10 https://lllplatform.eu/. , also for teachers. 11 11 https://school-education.ec.europa.eu/en/about/etwinning-future-teachers. Always taking advantage of the networks of connections existing throughout Europe. Teaching and awareness of what AI can and cannot do as a tool is a key step in making it more familiar in the educational context. A tool you can rely on. 7 Limits One of the most important limits of this paper is that it doesn't consider the ethical aspects (considering also GDPR's data protection) of the use of AI in many fields. Indeed, one of the most relevant paper's aims are primarily focused on the functional use of AI in fostering the so-called soft skills or life skills, without forgetting the dysfunctional or critical effects of its use (although not central). Thus, future studies, more focused on ethical effects of the use of AI to develop and foster soft skills, should deepen the critical aspects related, e.g., to data protection, data collection, and awareness to interact with non-human agents.

Table 2 Challenges Recommendations Implementation guidelines Making assessment hard to do via ChatGPT: How can management educators design assessment so ChatGPT is not solely used? Incorporate a recent real-life example, made up case study or scenario that is specifically related to the assessment. Adopt a context-based approach which involves students analysing a specific context that is unknown to ChatGPT by incorporating topics of interest that require synthesis. This context will only be known to students in that class so they will need to critically assess the information. Incorporating artificial intelligence usage into learning experiences: How can management educators encourage usage of artificial intelligence? Expose students to new learning mechanisms via artificial intelligence. Implement learning activities that incorporate artificial intelligence that might in turn lead to new information being found. Anticipating and recognising ChatGPT related dilemmas: How can management educators solve dilemmas when designing learning activities? Contextualise learning resources relative to business needs to realistically represent the market. Recognize the business realities of what ChatGPT means for information acquisition and dissemination. Integrating new educational technology into education: How can management educators integrate rather than discard educational technology? Take advantage of new educational technology that can provide benefits to students. Clarify why and how the educational technology is useful. Reducing uncertainty and cautiousness regarding ChatGPT: How can management educators reduce uncertainty and cautiousness regarding ChatGPT? Openly discuss the ramifications of ChatGPT for management education. Consider using multiple learning methods including ChatGPT as well as traditional material.

ChatGPT has been one of the most talked about computer programs amongst management educators in recent weeks due to its transformative ability to change how assessments are undertaken and graded. Unlike other educational technologies that can be tracked when used, ChatGPT has superior abilities that make it virtually untraceable when used. This creates a dilemma for management educators wanting to utilise the technology whilst staying relevant but also interested in authentic learning. Thus, it is critical for management educators to quickly implement policies regarding ChatGPT and subsequent new generative artificial intelligence because of its ease of use and affordability. This article is conceptual in nature and discusses ChatGPT as a generative form of artificial intelligence that presents challenges for management educators that need to be addressed through appropriate strategies. Thereby contributing to the literature on how technological innovations can be included in curriculum design and management learning practices. Practical and managerial implications are stated that highlight the critical need to re-examine existing education practices as a way of incorporating new technological innovation that can be utilised in a beneficial way. Keywords Academic research Teaching Learning Digital transformation Management education Artificial intelligence ChatGPT Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction Artificial intelligence is a buzzword that has special meaning for management educators as it offers systematic computing capabilities that result in human like answers (Goralski & Tan, 2022). Previously, artificial intelligence was a dreamlike concept and was discussed in the same way as stargazing projects like space tourism. However, artificial intelligence has suddenly become a reality and real time need due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and interest in real time computing (Lim et al., 2022). Originally artificial intelligence was considered to solve problems but not to disseminate information (Dwivedi et al., 2022). The usage of artificial intelligence has now evolved based on new computing capabilities becoming apparent (Buhalis & Karatay, 2022). Neural networks and algorithms have enabled artificial intelligence to engage in deep learning (Lundmark, 2022; Moy & Gadgil, 2022). Concurrent with the ongoing development of artificial intelligence has been the increased interest in chatbots that enable students to ask questions and obtain answers (Buhalis et al., 2023). Chatbots provide a similar service to teachers in providing real time feedback (Davis et al., 2009). Some recent generative artificial intelligence programs include ChatGPT and Bard with ChatGPT being the most discussed regarding new technological innovation (Dwivedi et al., 2023). ChatGPT was developed by the company OpenAI which acts as an artificial intelligence laboratory (Ali and OpenAI, 2023). It is apparent that ChatGPT will have a significant impact on management education because it is a machine learning system that is constantly updated with new information (Chatterjee & Dethlefs, 2023). It automatically learns unlike previous educational technology which was less sophisticated (Damar, 2022). Therefore, ChatGPT is a disruptive technology that was largely unpredicted by educational technology users and has potentially revolutionised the way management educators assess students and led to panic (Dibble, 2023). ChatGPT is trained with a reinforcement learner in which inputs are used for subsequent outputs, which means it is a generative pre-processed transformer that can predict answers (Dowling & Lucey, 2023). This results in ChatGPT being more advanced than other forms of generative artificial intelligence as it can conduct multiple tasks such as chatbot and conversationalist at the same time (Hammer, 2023). Therefore, it is unique for its ability to generate and report on topics as well as contributing to knowledge development (Floridi & Chiriatti, 2020). ChatGPT is capable of conducting a variety of human tasks that raises ethics issues (van Dis et al., 2023). This is based on current societal expectations regarding whether humans are required for certain tasks. Currently, the general sentiment is that ChatGPT does enable students to potentially cheat on assessments (Mollman, 2022). Thus, management educators need to change their assessments to include originality and creativity in the responses so it goes beyond the current capabilities of ChatGPT (Hu, 2023). The initial hype around ChatGPT has evolved to an ongoing discussion around authentic learning (O'Connor & ChatGPT, 2023). This is due to the implications of ChatGPT usage on students and educational institutions. The potential of student interaction via ChatGPT has engendered significant debate around educational technology and its place in society (Kung et al., 2023). It is apparent that the current literature has yet to fully explore the role of ChatGPT in management education (Liebrenz et al., 2023). Thus, the aim of this article is to bridge the gap between the artificial intelligence and management education literature by highlighting the relevance of ChatGPT as a form of generative learning. This will help in identifying what is missing in the current management education literature and provide some guidance for management educators in terms of practitioner and future research suggestions. At the moment there is a sense of uncertainty about the use of ChatGPT so the research objective of this article is to provide a discussion about how management educators can utilise the technology as a form of artificial intelligence. Thus, the main research question is: How can ChatGPT as a form of generative artificial intelligence be used by management educators? The structure of this article is as follows. The role of management education in society is discussed that highlights the requirement for future and existing business leaders to acquire new skills. The way artificial intelligence is being utilised in the current management educational context is stated that focuses on the important implications of technological innovations. Furthermore, ChatGPT as a technology is examined that includes a focus on its neural network and conversational computing elements. The last section investigates the challenges and strategies of ChatGPT usage for management educators. 2 Management education Management academics will play a key role in shaping future business leaders in terms of teaching key skills and enabling students to obtain a sense of responsibility whilst being proactive to learning relevant new technologies (Greenland et al., 2022). Promoting the use of new technology is essential for managers who need to keep abreast of global developments. Artificial intelligence as a form of technological innovation is the critical issue shaping the future of management education. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as an accelerator for managers to adopt digital technology and be ready for further artificial intelligence usage. Goralski and Tan (2022) suggest that management education is in a state of transition. This is due to large amounts of data being made available, making students need to access information as well as decipher its usefulness. Students learn in different ways compared to the past because of advanced technologies becoming available. This includes recognising real and fake information as well as being knowledgeable about credible sources of information. It is becoming difficult for management educators to predict the future needs of students due to continual global change and technological evolution. This means the future is unknown due to the unprecedented digital transformation that has recently occurred. The digitalization of many tasks means there is an emphasis on the digital and knowledge economy (Kraus et al., 2021). The current understanding of management education does not consider ChatGPT and subsequent artificial technologies. Consequently, to train students to use these technologies educators need to focus on creativity and futuristic thinking. This will enable students to solve problems through critical thinking that stresses continual learning. By questioning knowledge students can learn how to upskill and stay ahead of new developments. Educators should convey ideas in a way that makes sense, which means communication needs to be done in an efficient way. Currently, management educators tend to teach the what, the how and the how come in assessment. Table 1 presents some examples of these current management education assessments in terms of the task and examples. The what involves information and content that enables students to enlarge their knowledge repository. This can include a range of resources such as blogs and podcasts that detail information about how ChatGPT can be used in assessment items. The what provides a way for management educators to ask students to conduct a task using specific content or forms of process description. The how is the way the knowledge is learnt as a form of information acquisition. This can include doing tasks such as case studies or essays that enable students to integrate ChatGPT with the assessment item. By doing so they can find information using ChatGPT then apply that knowledge to a specific context. The how come is the resulting way students can utilise the knowledge in other contexts. This often refers to developing a skillset such as cultural competency in order to know how to analyse and obtain information. Other examples of the how come can include updating LinkedIn with skills used in relation to ChatGPT in order to show understanding of artificial intelligence resources. 3 Artificial intelligence in management education Emerging artificial intelligence capabilities are most likely to change management education in an unprecedented way. Di Cuonzo et al. (2023:2) defines artificial intelligence as \u201can imitation of human cognitive function\u201d. The recent breakthrough artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT will dramatically alter natural learning practices and analytical problem-solving abilities (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Artificial intelligence tools are a catalyst for educational change and will improve learning methods (OpenAI, 2022). Originally artificial intelligence was initially discussed in the context of science and engineering in terms of computer usage (McCarthy, 1958). It has rapidly evolved as computing processing speeds have increased to include reasoning and prediction power. Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2022:2) define artificial intelligence as \u201cthe examination of how digital computers and algorithms perform tasks and solve complex problems that would normally require or exceed the human intelligence\u201d. Artificial intelligence can improve the quality of education by optimizing access to knowledge (OpenAI, 2023). Thereby making real time communication possible that reduces delays in the learning process. Another definition of artificial intelligence by Huang and Rust (2021:31) states that it involves \u201cthe use of computational machinery to emulate capabilities inherent in humans, such as doing physical or mechanical tasks, thinking and feeling\u201d. This means the emphasis is on the interaction between computers, machines and humans in doing certain tasks that require some form of thinking. There are a range of artificial technologies utilised by management educators that range from traditional symbols based on mathematics to evolutionary computation and machine learning (DiCuonzo et al., 2023). Artificial intelligence can have different forms such as mechanical, thinking and feeling (Huang & Rust, 2018). Mechanical artificial intelligence involves repetitive tasks that occur on a frequent basis. Normally this involves routine tasks that need to be performed. Examples of mechanical artificial intelligence include translating text into verbal speech (Pechenkina, 2023). Thinking artificial intelligence requires more difficulty as it involve processing information. This includes deriving new knowledge based on the data provided. Thinking artificial intelligence goes beyond the abilities of mechanical artificial intelligence in recognising patterns in data. Thus, it infers deep learning that requires sophisticated information technology systems. Feeling artificial intelligence is more complex than thinking artificial intelligence as it involves some kind of emotional understanding. This means analysing sentiments in words and speech. Artificial intelligence assists educators to respond quickly to student needs by using technology and is helpful to deduce student expectations regarding information and knowledge (Ratten, 2020). (Verma et al. 2021) states \u201cAI-enabled systems are designed to observe and react to their surroundings\u201d. This means they work with large amounts of data to deduct environmental changes. We are now entering the fourth revolution in which digital technology is used and artificial intelligence plays an important role (Giuggioli & Pellegrini, 2022). Industry 4.0 involves an emphasis on digitalization in terms of automating tasks (Kagermann, 2014). This means it focuses on interconnected technology that helps improve workflows. This involves the Internet of Things in which devices communicate amongst each other. Artificial intelligence can help educators who are facing pressure to stay competitive (Ratten & Jones, 2021). This is due to freeing up time for educators to be involved in other tasks (Stokel-Walker, 2022). This means it empowers educators to act in a different way. Fig. 1 below provides a useful figure depicting the interaction between artificial intelligence, ChatGPT and management education. 4 ChatGPT as a technology ChatGPT as a technology is easy to use so it is destroying the old way of researching answers to a question (Lukpat, 2023). Currently, management educators cannot distinguish between a computer generated and human made piece of writing. This is likely to be an ongoing battle between plagiarism software and AI packages such as Chat GPT for technological ascendency (Dwivedi et al., 2023). GPT is defined as \u201ca machine learning model that uses unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to understand and generate human-like language\u201d (Lund & Wang, 2023, p. 1). Chatbots are a computer program that acts like a human in conversing with people over the internet. A generative model makes new data instead of relying on input data. ChatGPT is free to use which is different to other software that has been expensive to buy (Yeo-Teh & Tang, 2023). As a result, ChatGPT decreases the inequality gap between rich and poor thereby democratizing the market. Soon ChatGPT will be used by many students to summarise literature as well as to write papers. This makes it a major change to management education and has revolutionised educational practices. As it evolves its functions become more sophisticated and it is able to support decisions as well as writing responses. On the downside, is that students will become reliant on ChatGPT to complete assignments, and they may not develop intuitive skills. This degrades the quality of their work and fundamentally alters assessment practices. ChatGPT utilises multimodel neurons to internet text and images (Nature, 2023). A neural network is defined as \u201ca machine learning model composed of interconnected processing nodes that is trained on data to perform specific task by adjusting the strengths of connections between them\u201d (Lund & Wang, 2023, p. 1). These neurons are part of a neural network that processes information as a form of machine learning. This means it is trained to perform a task based on the connections between data in a neural network. ChatGPT uses knowledge from tasks to fine tune information in order to improve results (Open Culture, 2023). This allows patterns in the data to emerge that enables transfer learning to occur. Chat GPT is based on the GPT language model technology but enables conversations to occur (Terwiesch, 2023). It acts like a chatbot in answering questions as well as completing more sophisticated and complex tasks. ChatGPT interprets users\u2019 requests in order to fulfill their needs. It is a radical innovation in the context of natural language processing as it leverages data to understand information. This means it extracts meaning from text or speech in order to produce a result. Some aspects of ChatGPT can be biased in terms of gender or cultural connotations that makes them wrong when used (Pavlik, 2023). This can then lead to stereotypes rather than individualised and contextualised responses. Due to the emphasis on machine learning rather than human interaction the text produced can spread misinformation. Students then rely on these answers rather than thinking for themselves. Due to the technology available in the workforce there is now more emphasis on soft skills rather than hard skills. This is due to soft skills like teamwork and communicability being more important than hard skills such as data analysis that can be done by a computer. In order to differentiate themselves in the marketplace students will need to stand out with their personality and be accountable. These skills can be learnt via educational technology but are mostly learnt through social interactions in a real life environment. 5 Suggestions for management educators Management educators need to embrace new technology and this includes ChatGPT. There is no use in being negative about the introduction of artificial intelligence into management education as it is inevitable. This is particularly the case for technology competent young students who have used technology throughout their lives. In order to be more positive and proactive regarding artificial intelligence like ChatGPT management educators need to design new assessments that integrate technology with creative thinking. This is a difficult task to do as the normal practice for some time has been a shift from exams to case studies and assignments. ChatGPT allows for a student to ask a question then the program can write an essay, which is hard to differentiate from human made content (Taecharungroj, 2023). Thus, this creates a dilemma for management educators who tend to have similar types of assessment each semester. The question is: how can management educators engage with ChatGPT whilst maintaining learning standards? This is hard to answer due to the newness of ChatGPT and requirement to rethink existing curriculum. Perhaps what management educators can do is to include contextual studies that make it hard for ChatGPT or simulate environments in which ChatGPT has no knowledge. There are many alternatives and ways to do this but it will take some novel thinking about the best way forward. Fig. 2 states the main ways management educators can handle ChatGPT and future artificial intelligence. 6 Challenges and strategies of ChatGPT usage for management educators Given the influence of management education in the global economy, it is critical to address the challenges of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence. We focus on five main challenges, recommendations and implementation guidelines on how to address these challenges which are summarised in Table 2 . The first challenge involves making assessment to do via ChatGPT. This means management educators should incorporate a real life example that provides a context-based approach. The second challenge is incorporating artificial intelligence usage into the learning experience. This means exposing the students to new learning mechanisms that require new learning activities. The third challenge involves anticipating and recognising ChatGPT related dilemmas. This means contextualising learning resources so that business realities are recognised. The fourth challenge involves integrating new educational technology into education. By doing so it will take advantage of new information and communication technologies that can clarify why technology is useful in management contexts. The fifth challenge is to reduce uncertainty and cautiousness regarding ChatGPT. This means openly discussing its ramifications as a way of considering multiple learning methods. 7 Theoretical implications This article contributes to the literature on management education and use of new technologies by focusing on generative artificial intelligence, thereby extending current literature on how management education can incorporate technological innovations through the design of better assessment and learning practices. Existing theory does not adequately discuss the nature and role of ChatGPT in management education and instead relies on theory from other technologies. This means this article has provided a way of addressing current challenges faced by management educators and implementation guidelines around ChatGPT. As further generative artificial intelligence is used in a management education setting the findings of this article will be useful for future research. 8 Practical implications ChatGPT is a form of generative artificial intelligence that has only recently been introduced to management educators. Thus, there is still a lot to know and learn about how to embed it in management education curriculum and course design. This article has provided information about the role artificial intelligence plays in educational practices thereby highlighting the advantages and disadvantage so its usage. This is helpful for management educators who want to know more about current technological innovation as well as future technological change that will impact the way they teach management subjects. The information provided in this article is useful in terms of capturing the debate around how, why and when to use generative artificial intelligence. This includes focusing on how management educators can learn about new artificial intelligence and how they can be proactive about dealing with its usage. Many case studies in existing business management courses currently use static information but could be updated using the suggestions discussed in this article by taking a context-specific approach. This means the case study is dynamic and changing based on current events and business activity. For example, given the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a case study can incorporate recent information about changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. This would mean students would be required to reflect on current alterations in the global business environment that would require critical thinking. They could utilise ChatGPT to gather information about how conflict influences business activity but would require recent and up to date information to answer the question. Thereby combining information technology usage with problem solving activities. 9 Limitations and suggestions for future research The use of ChatGPT is still in its infancy so there is some sense of unease about the direction it will take. The discussion presented in this article provides some guidance and suggestions for management educators in terms of how to integrate artificial intelligence. The main limitation is the newness of ChatGPT as a technology and educational resource. This means more research is required on how management educators are using ChatGPT and how university policy regarding its usage is affecting its development. Future research should incorporate case study data as well as statistical verification about ChatGPT usage. This could include studies from a longitudinal perspective in terms of researching initial perceptions about ChatGPT and how this altered or stayed the same over time. It would be helpful to bring in both student and educator examples of ChatGPT usage in terms of knowing more about artificial intelligence usage. More research is required also on comparing ChatGPT to other artificial intelligence programs in terms of its advantages and disadvantages. This comparison would yield useful results that future researchers could then integrate into their research studies. 10 Conclusions ChatGPT is a novel technological innovation that is influencing how management educators think about curriculum development and learning practices. This article is amongst the first to specifically examine the role ChatGPT plays in a management education context. Due to the large student numbers studying management education and its relevancy for global economic development it is important to consider the implications of ChatGPT. This article has presented some suggestions about how management educators can implement artificial intelligence into assessment and teaching practices. Thereby offering help to those who are currently struggling with the need to balance the advantages and disadvantages of generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT (Lim et al., 2023). Further research is required to explore effective assessment practices in the era of ChatGPT. This research should encompass all educational sectors including school, further education and higher education. Potential research could consider the effective design of assessment to effectively combat ChatGPT. The emergence of ChatGPT means reconsidering assessment practices to real time options such as exams. Furthermore, ChatGPT places increased pressure on e-learning programmes to demonstrate the identity of their students.

A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 % of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being \u201ctruly\u201d creative. Keywords Creativity Originality AI Generative artificial intelligence Introduction While Artificial Intelligence has outperformed humans in numerous domains, including chess or GO (Miller, 2019), there is a prevailing sentiment that creativity remains one of the few arenas where humans still hold an advantage (Holford, 2019; Miller, 2019). However, recent generative artificial intelligence (GAI) developers have argued that their software is also creative (e.g. OpenAI advertises \u201cGPT-4 is more creative and collaborative as ever before\u201c, https://openai.com/product, as of August 2023). We put this claim to the test by comparing whether humans are (still) more creative than six GAIs and let both humans and AI be the judge of this. Artificial intelligence The increasing use of GAI in daily life is changing how we work, communicate, and create (Frosio, 2023). The GAI is an innovative approach that allows machines to learn from previously collected data and adapt to new situations. This key technology is becoming increasingly important for organizations. It helps with automated decision-making processes, detects patterns in large data sets, and improves people's overall efficiency (Noy & Zhang, 2023). An increasing number of tasks are automated; therefore, workers are left with more complex and potentially more creative tasks that require human ingenuity and problem-solving skills (Pistrui, 2018). As there is growing potential for GAI to perform complex tasks, there is also increasing interest in exploring how GAI can be used to support and enhance human creativity (Cope, 2005; Reddy, 2022). Recent research shows that working together with ChatGPT on complex creative tasks improves the individual's creative performance as well as their perceived self-efficacy beliefs (Urban et al., 2023). However, there is debate on whether AI can be genuinely creative or simply recombine existing knowledge to appear in new ways (Kirkpatrick, 2023; White, 2023). The discourse of GAI's potential usage and impact tends to reduce the dialog to a simple is or is not creative. However, scientific literature draws a much more detailed picture of creativity, as creative thinking and creative problem-solving are much more diverse. Typical examples include problem formulation, idea generation, idea selection, and potential idea implementation (Botella et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2016). GAI can generate vast amounts of new textual (e.g., ChatGPT, Dale, 2021) and visual (e.g., Dall-E, Marcus, Davis, & Aaronson, 2022) output based on written prompts through combining existing data in a new way. The human counterpart to this is free-associative thinking, the cornerstone of creative processes (Steele et al., 2018). The rapid emergence of new technologies generates a wealth of information that was not previously available. Unlike previous \"smart\" tools, which can aggregate existing knowledge, these new technologies can develop novel insights and solutions. This opens up possibilities for supporting human tasks in various domains, including healthcare, education, and entertainment (Seidel & Berente, 2020). However, it also raises important questions regarding the role of these technologies in facilitating human performance and how they might be designed to enhance and support creativity. In recent years, there have been numerous demonstrations of AI's capacity for creativity. For instance, algorithms can compose music (Civit et al., 2022), which can be regarded as creative, following the general definition of \"creating something new and useful\" (Runco & Jaeger, 2012). Google's AlphaGo program, which defeated the human world champion in the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016, is another remarkable example of AI's creative potential. AlphaGo mimicked human game players and generated new and sophisticated strategies to win the game (Miller, 2019). Additionally, DiPaola (2016) discussed the development of an AI system that emulates the creativity of a portrait painter, providing a new tool for artists and designers to explore novel creative paths and generate ideas that seem unlikely without AI assistance. GAIs are becoming more competent and more capable of replicating information from the web, including a range of services for complex digital tasks such as coding, template creation, and business administration. However, reported inaccuracies in AI systems question their usage as a reliable knowledge-creation tool and fuel a debate on the precise application possibilities and limits of these systems (Dale, 2021; Else, 2023; \u201cThe AI Writing on the Wall,\u201d, 2023). As for ChatGPT, the language model is trained on massive amounts of text data sourced from the internet, allowing it to learn patterns and relations between words and phrases in a language. The produced text is unreliable when facts are involved but more valuable when fiction and accidental combinations are required (as in fiction, poetry, and game dialogues, Dale, 2021). A vast knowledge base, combined with a few factual specifications, can support creative thinking in humans. The currently advanced version of GPT-4 is advertised as leading to more comprehensive, correct, and creative results, than the prior version GPT-3 (OpenAI, 2023a). Creativity Creativity is considered a skill only humans possess (Kirkpatrick, 2023). Plucker provided a widely accepted definition of creativity as \"the interaction of aptitude, process, and environment by which an individual or group produces a perceptible product that is both novel and useful as defined within a social context\" (Plucker et al., 2004). Creativity can be defined as creating and enacting something new, unique, and original (Sawyer, 2012). This pragmatic definition of creativity as \"something new and useful\" (Runco & Jaeger, 2012) is widely applied. However, these definitions are not linked to anything innately human, such as experience, emotions, or moral understanding. Thus, for machines, robots, and AI systems to be recognized as creative, they do not have to replicate the attitudes, behaviors, or actions of creative humans; rather, they need to replicate the cognitive process and the outcome to achieve something perceivable as \"new and useful\" (Cropley et al., 2023). Thus, whether GAI is creative is not the right question, as it is about the perceptually creative output. What is somewhat worth asking is the significance of their creative output. Creativity can be distinguished from everyday level to higher, eminent levels of creative output with far-reaching consequences for a domain or a social area (Amabile, 2017; Richards, 2010). Whereas everyday creativity is mostly fast-paced, highly related to improvisation, and built into our everyday work and living, higher levels of creative achievement require significantly more time, specific knowledge, and often testing phases to determine whether a potential solution holds up (Benedek et al., 2020; Kaufman et al., 2016; Simonton, 2013). In our research we focus on everyday creativity. Since a chatbot only produces output in response to a written prompt, the creative work of a chatbot is dependent on human input. If the chatbot is used to solve a creative task to generate ideas on a specific topic, then the human needs to write a prompt that best represents the creative challenges core. The prompt therefore defines the creative problem. Similarly, the further processing and potential implementation of the ideas generated by the GAI is also to be done or coordinated by humans. A chatbot can deliver a vast amount of generated output, from which users can and need to choose how to follow up. Thus, the GAI is inherently capable of \"being creative\", that is, able to generate ideas, but this does not resemble the full creative process observed with humans. Idea production can only be purposeful if the problem which precedes it is fully understood. If the creative problem or challenge is clear, criteria can be formed to recognize an idea as suitable for the problem (Lazar et al., 2022). This recognition of fit, meaningfulness, and situational novelty lies in individual human consideration (Cropley et al., 2023). Thus, the potential creative GAI has, at least at the moment, an assistance role, which can support a certain aspect of the holistic process: idea generation. In this article, we ask to what extent GAI chatbots can produce new and useful output given an every-day creative task. Assuming its assistance role, these tools would require at least a medium performance to be considered a useful assistance for humans working on creative tasks. Thus, we test experimentally whether AI performance is comparable with human creative performance for everyday-creative tasks. Method Participants and chatbots A power analysis revealed that we need at least 88 participants to detect a small-to-medium effect size of d = 0.35 with a power of 0.90. In total, 100 participants completed our study (M age = 41.00, SD = 12.25, 50 women, 50 men), who were recruited through Prolific Academic. All participants provided informed consent at the beginning of the study. The study was approved by the Humboldt-University of Berlin. Participants were all native English speakers from the USA with full- or part-time work. We paid a prorated rate of US-$9 per hour. The average completion time was 17 min. Initially, we selected five GAI chatbots: Alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT version 3, Studio, and YouChat. We selected them based on their free usability and similar functions to ensure comparability. Alpa.ai is a system for training and deploying large-scale neural networks that have been made available as an open-source project. Its primary objective is to streamline the distributed training and deployment process of these networks, and it has been designed to do so with minimal code input required. A team of researchers created Alpa in the Sky Lab at UC Berkeley. We used the Chatbot function with maximum response length to collect the answers for the five prompts, respectively. Copy.ai uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate explicitly creative ideas. The tool is meant for content creation, such as social media posts, blogs, etc. It comes with a variety of features suited for specific content needs. Copy.ai has a chatbot function, which appeared rather limited in its output, so we used the \"freestyle\" template instead. This template can generate \"more like this\", which we used three times to generate more ideas. ChatGPT is a language model based on the GPT-3 database developed by OpenAI, which can generate human-like responses to natural language inputs. It uses deep learning techniques to analyze and understand language patterns and can provide answers to a wide range of questions and prompts. After finishing our initial data collection and analyses, we added answers from the newer version, based on the GPT-4 database with more extensive training data, leading to more comprehensive and (according to the developers' webpage) more creative output. Studio is the AI21 Studio, a new developer platform developed by AI21 Labs based on their developed Large Language Model called Jurassic-1 and allows users to build their applications and services. We used Playground to interact freely, which comes closest to a chatbot tool. YouChat is a messaging platform and AI-powered search assistant created by You.com. Users can leverage its capabilities to ask various questions, receive helpful explanations and recommendations, translate text across different languages, summarize written content, and perform other useful tasks. Materials Participants completed the Alternative Use Test for five prompts. They were instructed to write down as many ideas as possible for a ball, fork, pants, tire, and toothbrush, respectively. These objects are commonly used in creativity tests (Reiter-Palmon et al., 2019; Silvia et al., 2008; Vartanian et al., 2019) and can therefore be reliably assessed by the AI-rating tool we used (the AI had been trained on many prompts, with highest reliability for the five we used, Organisciak et al., 2023). Human participants were given three minutes for each object to write down as many ideas as possible. The order in which the prompts were presented was randomized. To get responses from the six GAI chatbots, we used the same prompt: \"What can you do with [prompt]?\". We used separate chat sessions for each prompt, so prior answers would not impact the following ones. For all chatbots, responses were limited to a certain length of answers, which we increased by asking \"What else?\" up to three times (for Copy.ai, we used the option \"more like this\"). In some instances, a chatbot would also respond with something like \"I can't think of anything.\" This is similar to what some humans reported. These kinds of no-answers were excluded from the data set. In other cases, the chatbots would report unrelated answers (e.g., \"I am not a big fan of the toothbrush. I think it is overrated.\"). This is again similar to human answers, and those were also excluded from the data. In one case, when asking for the use of pants, alpa.ai could not bring up any alternate uses. Procedure Data were collected in early February 2023. All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the 1975 Helsinki Declaration and the ethics guidelines from the institution of the lead author. Six human raters rated the responses from human participants and five of the six GAI chatbots (GPT-4 was released on the 14th of March), blind to the origin of the responses. The order of the prompts was randomized throughout the raters, and the list of ideas was randomized. The six human raters were instructed to follow the CAT method (Amabile, 1982), which comprised using the full range of the originality scale from 1 to 5. The first author provided detailed instructions to all raters on how to evaluate individual ideas, which included defining non-relevant responses. Clear definitions for both 'originality' and 'creativity' were presented and deliberated upon. For consistency, all raters began by assessing an initial set of 100 randomly selected responses to resolve any ambiguities in their evaluations before proceeding to rate the entirety of the ideas. Additionally to human raters, we assessed originality scores for all human-generated as well as all six GAI chatbot-generated answers by a trained large language model for assessing AUT prompts (Organisciak et al., 2023). This measure derives from an extensive dataset comprising human evaluations of AUT prompts sourced from earlier creativity research. Notably, these human ratings exhibit a strong correlation with AI-generated assessments, with rm = 0.80. To ensure the integrity of the AI's ratings, we selected five prompts that demonstrated a correlation exceeding 0.80 between human and AI evaluations. These prompts were ball, fork, pants, tire, and toothbrush (cf. Organisciak et al., 2023). Fluency scores were calculated for the AI and the six raters as the sum of ideas from each participant and the GAI chatbots. The sum of ideas varied slightly, as the raters differed in their assessment of non-relevant answers coded as no-answer. Results Six humans and a specifically trained AI (Organisciak et al., 2023) independently rated the originality of each response produced by humans and GAI, blind to the creator of the response. Since most humans and GAIs produced more than one response, we averaged across responses separately for each creator and prompt to obtain an originality and a fluency score for each human and each GAI, separately for each of the five prompts. After we completed our data analyses in early March 2023, a GAI advertised as \u201cmore creative\u201d than its prior versions, GPT-4 was released. We included it in some follow-up analyses but not the main analysis, as explained below. The data and the R-code to reproduce the analyses can be found at https://osf.io/9fctd/?view_only=6c8f02c6972b49319c12f87cfb3f76db Originality To estimate the interrater reliability between the six human raters, we computed the intraclass correlations using the R-package irr (Gamer, Lemon, & Singh, 2021). Interrater reliability was excellent (Cicchetti, 1994): Intraclass correlations ranged from 0.85 to 0.94 for the five prompts, indicating that human raters mostly agreed on which answers were original (supplemental materials, Table S1). To test whether ratings from humans and the creativity scoring AI align, we averaged across all six human raters and correlated the score with the score from the AI. Correlation coefficients were very high, rs = 0.78 - 0.94, ps < 0.0001, indicating that also humans and AI mostly agree on which response can be considered original. To test whether humans or the GAI chatbots were more creative, we ran two linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and random slopes for the five prompts using the R-package lme4 (Bates et al., 2015). The first model, which included human-rated responses as the dependent variable, found no mean difference between human and GAI-generated ideas, B = \u22120.21, SE = 0.15, p = .218. The second model, which included AI-rated responses as the dependent variable, also found no mean difference between human and GAI-generated ideas, B = \u22120.18, SE = 0.13, p = .241. These results were mostly replicated in between-subject t-tests (Table 1 ). Only human-rated responses for forks and AI-rated responses for toothbrush humans outperformed the GAI (Figs. 1 and S1). Given the number of comparisons and unequal sample sizes (100 vs. 5), we decided to additionally compute the number of participants who received a higher originality score than the most original GAI. For pants, for example, human raters rated 42 humans as more original than the most original GAI, whereas the AI rated 52 humans as more original than the most original GAI. Across all prompts, 32.8 humans were more original than the most original GAI. Finally, we compared the five GAIs. None of the GAI chatbots emerged as more original than the other four across all five prompts (Figs. 2 , S2). GPT-4 After we completed the analyses, including the five GAIs, GPT-4 was released in mid-March 2023. We had ChatGPT version 4 also complete the AUT. Its responses were only analyzed by the AI because the human raters would have likely known that the responses were not human, thus potentially biasing their ratings. Given the high correlations between human raters and the AI, we speculate that the findings would have been similar if humans had rated it. ChatGPT version 4 outperformed all five other GAIs, except for the prompt ball, for which it ranked second (Fig. 3 ). When we compared the performance of ChatGPT version 4 to humans, 2 humans were more creative than the most creative AI for the prompt pants, 29 were more creative for the prompt ball, none were more creative for tire, 3 were more creative for fork, and 13 more creative for toothbrush. On average, 9.4 humans were more creative than ChatGPT version 4 across all prompts. Fluency Results for fluency are reported in the supplemental materials. In short, intraclass correlations and correlations between human raters and the AI were between 0.98 and 1.00. Since most of the GAI chatbots were prompted multiple times, the GAI chatbots came up with 2\u20133 times more ideas than humans (Figs. S3, S4). Fluency and originality were mostly unrelated across prompts and raters (humans vs AI), rs = \u22120.28 to 0.26. Discussion The question of whether GAIs such as ChatGPT, Studio.ai, and You.com can be considered creative is complex. Our research showed that their output for a standardized creativity measure for broad-associative \"thinking\" is as original as the human-generated ideas. Thus, from a scientific perspective, these chatbots are creative, as their output was judged as comparable to human output by human raters and AI. Some critics have argued that chatbots cannot replicate the creativity of humans, as human creativity is a combination of real-world experience, emotion, and inspiration (Kirkpatrick, 2023; White, 2023). However, the definition and common measurement of creativity do not require these elements. It is defined as the ability to produce something new and useful (Runco & Jaeger, 2012), which can be judged by those engaging with the potentially creative output. We believe that this definition can also be applied to GAIs. Our results show that when chatbots are asked the same question as humans, they generate more ideas, which are, on average, as original as ideas generated by humans. As the sheer number of ideas is less important, and the assessment style between humans and chatbot conversations is less comparable, we do not want to stress the results for fluency too much. However, GAI chatbots can recombine knowledge so that the ideas presented are considered original. The argument against GAIs' creative potential stems from two distinct but linked arguments: GAI is missing (so far) a connection to the real world, with emotions and imagination, and second, GAI is thus not capable of \"actual\" creativity, as high level creative endeavors. Although we cannot speak against both positions, we aim to advance this debate by closely looking into human creativity: generating creative output is much closer to recombining existing knowledge than actually developing anything new (Corazza, 2016; Frosio, 2023), and secondly, most humans do not come close to creative acts which are leading to eminent, high level creativity. Instead, we use and apply our human creativity to improve (and improvise) everyday tasks (Benedek et al., 2020; Reddy, 2022; Richards, 2010). This is not to belittle human creativity but instead aims to show the GAI chatbot's potential to be comparable to human creative abilities. Especially art as a creative output seems driven by our human ability to dream, visualize and imagine potential futures. However, developing new ideas, which can serve a specific intention, solve an issue, or deliver an abstract meaning, is always built on a cumulative tradition of knowledge within the domain of art (Baer, 2015; Bruno, 2022). Most creativity-support systems in businesses thus focus on generating, processing, and retrieving knowledge (Maiden, 2019; M\u00fcller-Wienbergen et al., 2011). Brain scan analyses showed that idea generation is similar to knowledge retrieval (Benedek, 2018). Thus, similar to GAIs, we retrieve and recombine existing knowledge to make it appear new. Arguably, current databases of these chatbots do have a much larger knowledge base than any human being could possess, which makes the potential idea recombination that chatbots can provide much wider (Gruner & Csikszentmihalyi, 2019). The second argument, the missing potential for high level or eminent creativity, seems unjust against the GAIs: human's ability of high level of creativity \u2013 bringing forward actual world-changing ideas \u2013 is also minimal. Mostly, we generate something new and useful for us in a specific and thus limited context. Our study shows GAI chatbots can compete with human ideation skills when it comes to everyday creativity. The prompts we used for the idea generation are very generic. When we consider more complex problems, a proper solution is achieved by including several factors, such as intense domain knowledge and creative thinking, individual subjective experiences, emotions, cultural background, and the capacity for abstract thinking. Here, current GAI chatbots appear to perform well on complex knowledge-intensive tasks, such as complex coding tasks: ChatGPT can free up coders on tedious work (Bellaiche et al., 2023) so that the coder can focus on more complex, creative work aspects (Dell\u2019Aversana, 2023). However, ChatGPT is shown to be rather limited in emotional responses and evaluations and shows less reliable performance with more complex tasks (Koco\u0144 et al., 2023). Overall, GAI chatbots show a convincing human-like or potentially above-human performance for some tasks which was also found in research published after the present study was conducted (Guzik et al., 2023), whereas their performance is limited in others. Concerning creative performance, GAI can generate ideas based on specific input but cannot create the need to ideate. The motivation to engage with a specific creative task and problem understanding must come from the human interacting with the tool (Cropley et al., 2023). Thus, GAI is limited considering the overall creative process: it would not trigger the creative process. It can only respond to a prompt that is given. Thus, the problem definition is currently still uniquely human, as is evaluating whether an idea fits a problem. Although, for particular contexts, such as the assessment of the AUT output, an AI sufficiently assessed the quality of the generated ideas (Organisciak et al., 2023). An intriguing solution to the debate whether AI can be creative was recently proposed by Runco (2023), who suggested that we should refer to \u201cArtificial Creativity\u201d as we are referring to \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d. Runco challenges the notion of \"creative AI\" and suggests labeling computer-generated outputs as \"artificial creativity,\" emphasizing that while such outputs may be original and effective, they lack essential human creative qualities. GAI chatbots possess the capability to uncover novel connections by leveraging their extensive knowledge base at specific stages of the creative process. Human involvement is crucial in framing a pertinent problem and executing the chosen solution. Our study shows that chatbots can generate ideas on the same level as humans, especially on the level of everyday creativity (with ChatGPT version 4 showing the best results, followed by Copy.ai, ChatGPT version 3.5, and YouChat scoring all similarly high in terms of the originality of ideas). Whether the person interacting with the GAI achieves every day or eminent levels of creative achievement are more up to the person than the GAI. GAI can successfully support the creative process and generate ideas, but it remains the task of humans to make sense of it and embed this in physical reality (Verganti et al., 2020). This speaks for the merging of human and artificial competencies in the form of augmented creativity \u2013 which is the most optimistic and benevolent future development for the usage of AI (Vinchon et al., 2023). There are some limitations to our research. Our experimental design likely led to an underestimation of the creativity of humans and GAIs. We paid participants to generate ideas for creative tasks they might not care about. However, intrinsic motivation strongly contributes to creative performance (Amabile & Pratt, 2016; Luria & Kaufman, 2017), potentially leading to an overall human underperformance. Regarding chatbots, smart prompting is how the best answers are obtained, which we did not use to allow a direct comparison between humans and chatbots. The actual potential for chatbots as creative assistants is likely much higher. Tailored prompts and reshaping answers given by the chatbots will likely lead to much more concise and, thus, relevant answers. Also, chatbots can be used to get information from a specific angle, such as for a certain profession, which can improve the quality of answers a user seeks, which we did not test here either. Although the AUT is a widely used creativity measurement, there is an ongoing debate regarding its validity (Karwowski, 2015; Runco et al., 2016). As chatbots use wide parts of the internet as a source of their data, it could be the case these databases include test material and thus previously given human answers to the prompts used by the AUT. It is essential to recognize that the responses of chatbots are predominantly determined by statistical predictions of the most appropriate subsequent words (OpenAI, 2023b). Hence, even if exact human responses to AUT prompts are embedded in a chatbot's foundational training dataset, they would not necessarily manifest in the produced output. We did not measure usefulness to assess the reported ideas because originality is the more important part of the \"new and useful\" definition (Diedrich et al., 2015). Further, judging an idea's usefulness is difficult without a proper real-life application to serve as an anchor. When we assessed the AUT with the chatbots, we pushed for more answers, with a relatively arbitrary number maximum of three times. In our past interactions with chatbots, a recurrent theme emerged: most chatbots tended to yield a fairly standard volume of content in response to open-ended queries. While each began with a predetermined set of ideas, their adaptability and depth differed when nudged for more, using prompts like \u201cwhat else.\u201d It's worth noting that some platforms, such as Alpa.ai, reached their output threshold rather swiftly, either stalling with no additional feedback or generating incongruous replies. To institute uniformity in our evaluations, we limited the succession of probing questions to three. This limitation, albeit somewhat arbitrary, complicates direct comparisons between the prolificacy of chatbot-generated content and human responses, if solely based on the number of responses. Research has shown that exposure to other people's creative ideas can stimulate cognitive activity and enhance creativity (Fink et al., 2012). Participants who were prompted with highly creative ideas generated more creativity than those who were given random, unrelated words. In this study, the comparison between the most original humans vs. chatbot shows that humans had the most creative answers in all but one case. Thus, humans can (still) serve as ideation partners. However, on a more pragmatic note, it might be easier to ask a chatbot than to find a motivated human to run ideas by. Our study and a lot of anecdotal evidence on the web show the possibility of generating creative output in combination with a GAI, be it a writing tool, chatbot, or picture generation. The potential is real for GAIs to properly support human (creative) work. However, the ethical dilemma needs to be addressed, as the potential for misuse (\u201cThe AI Writing on the Wall,\u201d, 2023) or harmful application of the GAIs is present as with any potent technology (\u201cMuch to Discuss in AI Ethics,\u201d, 2022). Taken together, the question whether GAI is creative can be answered pragmatically with: yes, on an everyday level as much or as little as humans. We recommend avoiding viewing GAI chatbots as omnipotent tools that may replace human performance. Instead, they can be valuable assistants in provoking, listing, and reviewing thoughts and ideas. The extensive knowledge base they build upon can be very useful in expanding one's ideas. The more our (working) life's are automated, and the more authority automation acquires, the more important the human role with its creative abilities and motivation becomes (Parasuraman et al., 2008; Runco, 2023).

Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to transform the work context deeply. Currently, multiple AI systems are being studied and applied in the mental healthcare field, challenging traditional ways of performing tasks by professionals. Objectives This study aims to verify to what extent AI impacts mental healthcare workers\u2019 tasks, describe how AI impacts those tasks, and identify which tasks are impacted. Design Two databases were used to find empirical research published between 2019 and December 2022. A total of 46 papers were included in the review. Results AI was most often employed for assessment tasks, in which it is generated to support physicians in the diagnostic process. Patient monitoring was also explored by a few papers, which applied intelligent systems to aid professionals by identifying variables that can predict the outcome of the therapeutic process and detect the patients' mood. Regarding therapy, AI systems can contribute by providing insights into patient-therapist interaction and the patient's emotional states. Finally, documentation and medical prescriptions were addressed by one article which measured physicians' opinions on the impact of AI on their jobs. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence systems impact the tasks of mental healthcare workers by providing support and enabling greater insights. Most systems aimed to aid mental healthcare workers instead of replacing them. These results highlight the relevance of training professionals to enable hybrid intelligence. Keywords Mental healthcare Artificial intelligence Psychologist Psychiatrist Therapist Mental healthcare worker 1 Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a quickly advancing and promising field, which is believed to yield great societal benefits, such as the eradication of disease and poverty (Russell, Dewey, & Tegmark, 2015; Wahl, Cossy-Gantner, Germann, & Schwalbe, 2018). Research in AI concerns itself with enabling computers to emulate human reasoning (Millington, 2019). Artificial intelligence can be defined through the concept of intelligent systems presented by (Artificial Intelligence). According to the authors, most definitions of these systems can be summarized through the following list: (1) Technologies that comprise thinking abilities comparable to those present in human beings; (2) Technologies that perform actions alike humans; (3) Technologies that hold the ability for rational thinking, and; (4) Technologies that have the capacity to act rationally. Machine Learning (ML) refers to systems that \u201clearn\u201d from information. In other words, they increase in performance measured on a task as experience increases. As such, ML can be defined very broadly, where a large range of different systems possessing such traits could be defined as ML. Examples of ML systems include bayesian networks, regression models, decision trees, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) (Janiesch, Zschech, & Heinrich, 2021). ANNs are systems that are inspired by biology, functioning on the activation of units called artificial neurons. These neurons are connected and they signal each other mathematically. The strength of the signal a neuron sends depends on the strength of the input signals the neuron receives. The influence neurons have on each other is constantly tuned during the training process in order to optimize the performance on a task (Zhang, Yang, Lin, Ji, & Gupta, 2018). Within this class of systems, further distinctions are possible. For instance, a Neural Network consists of three layers: (1) An input layer that receives the information: (2) One or more hidden layers that analyze the information; (3) An output layer that returns the result of that analysis (Patterson & Gibson, 2017). However, another commonly used subcategory is Deep Learning (DL). DL refers to Artificial Neural Networks consisting of more than one hidden layer, in addition to other network architectures. Other DL systems alter the neuron's connectivity and functioning, resulting in different structures and operations which mitigate some of the weaknesses from other architectures. Common architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. However, there exists no sharp border between algorithms that can be classified as deep or non-deep learning. What Artificial Neural Networks tends to separate from other ML algorithms is their capability to discover representations suitable for the task at hand (Janiesch et al., 2021). As the distinction is not sharply defined in the literature, the current paper categorizes ANNs of any shape or form as DL systems. More categorizations in ML exist. Some AI technologies employ what is referred to as symbolic AI. Here, instead of learning from a series of data instances, the system works based on a set of previously-defined knowledge rules. This functioning makes the outcome interpretable, contrasting with many machine learning techniques (Hoehndorf & Queralt-Rosinach, 2017). Next, there are Fuzzy Systems (FS), a type of symbolic AI that works based on logic, more specifically fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic (Czabanski et al., 2017 pp. 23\u201343). Fuzzy logic makes use of probabilities to compute the likelihoods. An example of this would be estimating the likelihood of an individual having a disease based on his symptoms (Venkata Subba Reddy, 2017). These types of systems (ANN, ML, symbolic AI, and FS) differ regarding the extent to which their outcomes can be interpreted and suitable use cases. ANNs are able to uncover much more complicated patterns but simultaneously operate as a black box, where the system's output cannot be reasoned upon. ANNs function well on large datasets and are in general much more data-hungry. In contrast, typical, and generally older, ML methods (such as decision tree, random forests, and Support Vector Machines) work well on smaller datasets and are easier to grasp and reason about (Janiesch et al., 2021). In the case of ANNs, questions such as why a prediction is given, as of today, cannot be answered reliably if at all. In contrast, a decision tree's output can simply be visualized, while a random forest can be understood as a majority vote from multiple decision trees. This is not to say that all ML methods are equally interpretable, nor are all models of the same type of ML. For instance, a decision tree, given that it is large enough, can become hard or impossible to interpret. AI is currently one of the most popular fields of study. For instance, six out of the ten most popular search terms on IEEE Xplore's database (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/), as of October 2022, are either Artificial Intelligence or related terms, such as Image Processing, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Big Data, and Deep Learning. Currently, AI systems are being researched for mental health applications. Some areas of focus include the improvement of tasks, such as in (Horn & Weisz, 2020) in which AI is explored for the enhancement of psychotherapy. Another topic of study is the support of the healthcare system by aiding the allocation of resources (van Mens et al., 2022). A concern, however, is that while AI systems are already being adopted in healthcare, different stakeholder groups (such as government policymakers, hospital managers/doctors, and IT firm managers) sometimes exhibit contradictory viewpoints concerning this adoption. From one perspective, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence is perceived as an important innovative step that will bring about great contributions to the work context, increasing efficiency in completing tasks (Sun & Medaglia, 2019). One of the ways AI could aid professionals is through the application of Hybrid Intelligence systems (Dellermann, Lipusch, Ebel, & Marco Leimeister, 2018). This concept refers to systems that combine both human and computational intelligence (Kamar, 2016). Conversely, potential negative consequences such as job losses and privacy issues raise concerns regarding its application (Sun & Medaglia, 2019). An increasing amount of jobs are being replaced by AI systems. Given this trend toward automation, it is reasonable to think AI could eventually emulate mental health professionals (David and Luxton, 2016). Al-Sabhan, Mahmud and Khaled (Al-Sabhan and MahmudNada, 2020) address AI use in healthcare, defending that the positive implications and opportunities brought by the use of Artificial Intelligence systems are greater than the possible negative outcomes, particularly when those outcomes are dealt with properly and prevented. Therefore, it is relevant to develop a more in-depth understanding of how the use of this technology will impact healthcare workers to contribute to the beneficial application of these systems. Researchers have already addressed their concerns regarding the safety of the applicability of these technologies and the possibility of their replacement of healthcare workers in some of their roles (Loh, 2018). The application of AI systems for mental healthcare tasks, such as counseling, is already being explored (Russell, 2019). Furthermore, it is suggested that some job positions in other fields, such as helpline workers, are already experiencing job loss derived from the application of AI (Modli\u0144ski & Bartosiak, 2021). Due to AI's rapid learning abilities, compared to that of humans, it is expected that these technologies will also affect the jobs of mental healthcare professionals (David, 2014). In this context, it is crucial to gain insight into how these technologies will impact the mental healthcare sector, specifically, the workers' tasks. Studying that impact enables prospective human resource management in the mental healthcare sector, allowing gains in effectiveness, performance, and well-being of professionals and managers, leading them to deliver better services to society. This scoping review intends to systematize the empirical research that focuses on the impact already witnessed in the field. 1.1 Artificial intelligence for mental healthcare Currently, many Artificial Intelligence systems have been created for application in mental health (Tom, Miles, Cowie, & Ridge, 2019). Chatbots are an example of an application of AI being explored for use in healthcare. Abd-alrazaq et al. (Abd-alrazaq et al., 2019) conducted an overview of different chatbots employed for mental healthcare. To do this, the authors made use of seven bibliographic databases to explore existing chatbots and their key features. The different systems were classified based on their purpose, the platforms they were built in, how they responded, and the initiative regarding their dialogues. Further, it was examined how they generated responses, types of input/output, the disorders they deal with, and if the chatbots were embodied or not. From the observed systems, 47 aimed to provide therapy, 12 were built for training, and 10 for screening. The authors observed that most chatbots only allowed the user to interact by writing and that the most common way of providing feedback was a mix of text, audio, and imagery. The mental disorders the chatbots most frequently targeted were depression and autism. It was concluded that the use of chatbots for mental health is an expanding field and that it is important to conduct more studies on these systems in order to understand how effective these are or can be for mental health. Is it also relevant to know what is the level of acceptance of stakeholders regarding these technologies. Another important study was the one conducted by European Commission and Joint Research Centre, G\u00f3mez-Gonz\u00e1lez, and G\u00f3mez (European Commission Joint Research Centre et al., 2020). The authors briefly present the uses of AI systems for healthcare until the present day and consider some of the possible applications of this software, as well as the social and ethical impact of these technologies. These authors state that these systems could contribute to what they call \u201cextended personalized medicine\u201d (p.2). The goal of this type of medicine is to adapt the diagnosis and treatment to the individual's needs, making use of data such as their genetic features. This connects to the concept of \u201cprecision medicine\u201d (p.7), which can be described by the use of a series of data sources, such as demographic data, societal data, and mood recognition, through AI-mediated systems, in order to process, connect and analyze this data. Information technology tools have been demonstrated to alleviate the burden on health services. Artificial Intelligence and data mining techniques were identified as among the most promising approaches to support healthcare administration by augmenting clinical care and lessening administrative demands on clinicians (Reddy, Fox, & Purohit, 2019). When properly applied, AI systems could greatly benefit patients by, for instance, supplementing the doctors\u2019 expertise and decreasing medical error (Aung, Wong, & Ting, 2021). AI is expected to be a transformational tool in the workforce, deeply changing the ways people work (Bughin et al., 2017) and diminishing the strain on the healthcare system (Naseem, Akhund, Arshad, & Ibrahim, 2020). Given the potential for the application of these technologies, it is important to address how these will impact the tasks of healthcare workers. Presently, AI-mediated software is still \u201cweak AI\u201d, and can only perform a limited amount of tasks. While some argue that due to the speed of processing allowed by Artificial Intelligence systems, these could highly influence and possibly replace the doctor's performance (European Commission Joint Research Centre et al., 2020), others highlight the importance of certain elements, such as empathy in therapeutic care (Moudatsou, Stavropoulou, Philalithis, & Koukouli, 2020) which are a limitation of AI systems (Montemayor, Halpern, & Fairweather, 2022). 1.2 Mental healthcare workers The following mental healthcare workers were selected for the present study: (a) Psychologists; (b) Therapists/Counselors; (c) Psychiatrists. This selection was based on the mental healthcare workers\u2019 categories defined by the Anxiety & Depression Association of America (Anxiety & Depression Association of America, 2023). Social workers and general practitioners were excluded. The rationale for the exclusions is the following. Regarding social workers, part of their tasks can include therapy or counseling. However, the general description of the tasks of social workers is broad, in the sense that it ranges over a variety of topics. A great portion of these topics does not (directly) contribute to mental health specifically, such as policy formulation and political intervention (International Federation of Social Workers, 2023). This is in contrast with psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors, whose tasks are clearly in the function of mental health. Likewise, although general practitioners (GP) are involved in the mental health field, it is not their expertise. According to the UK's National Health Services (NHS, 2023a), GPs offer treatment for common medical issues. Besides this, they function as a link between patients and hospitals, referring them to specialists and urgent care. For this reason, general practitioners were not included in this study. Regarding the included mental healthcare professionals, psychologists are versed in the understanding of behavioral and emotional components of human beings. They hold knowledge about the conceptual world of individuals and their thoughts (Anxiety & Depression Association of America, 2023). Scientific knowledge is at the base of this understanding (Canadian Psychological Association, 2023). Some branches of psychology are not closely related to mental health. That is the case for organizational psychologists, sports psychologists, economic psychologists, marketing psychologists, and others. Therefore, only psychologists whose job is directly related to mental health were included. Psychologists can practice in schools, hospitals, clinics, private offices, and other spaces and are commonly involved in research alongside their practice. Some examples of topics addressed by these professionals include managing stress, dealing with relationship issues, treating addictions, and mental health problems (Canadian Psychological Association, 2023). The terms counselors/therapists are broader titles often used to describe mental healthcare workers that can give psychotherapy and (or) counseling, such as psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurses. These sessions can include one person (individual) or multiple people (like families, couples, and groups). Some of the topics which can be addressed by therapists/counselors include stress, addiction, and issues within a family or marriage (Anxiety & Depression Association of America, 2023). For the context of this research the title \u201ccounselors\u201d was chosen to describe mental healthcare workers within this category. According to the UK's National Health Services, a psychiatrist is tasked with diagnosing patients and treating them. Furthermore, the prevention of mental health issues is another role of these professionals. Contrary to psychologists and counselors, psychiatrists are considered doctors and prescribe medication. Psychiatrists can practice in spaces such as outpatient clinics and hospitals. Regarding the type of health issues these mental health professionals tackle, these can include but are not limited to: addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia (NHS, 2023b). 1.2.1 Mental healthcare workers\u2019 tasks Based on the task descriptions by the American National Alliance on Mental Illness (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2020) and the American Professional Agency (American Professional Agency, 2023), the authors selected five mental healthcare workers\u2019 tasks to be analyzed in the context of this study (see Table 1 ): (1) assessment, (2) therapy, (3) prescription, (4) documentation, and (5) monitoring. The American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2023) defines assessment as a process in which information regarding the patient's behaviors and other relevant data is assembled. The goal of this collection is to allow mental healthcare workers to gain insight into the patient's context and gather data that will be useful for the next steps of the therapeutic process. The assessment can be performed in the form of tests, interviews, observations, and other approaches. Therapy is a term used in several fields. Within the context of this study, the word therapy refers to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is a general concept assigned to therapy in which the patient speaks to a mental healthcare professional with the goal of treating mental health issues (Mayo Clinic, 2016). According to the US National Institute of Mental Health (National Insitute of Mental Health, 2023), psychotherapy encompasses tasks such as: giving the patient emotional support, identifying causes of stress, and applying techniques to decrease it. During psychotherapy the mental healthcare professional can provide help through the analysis of the patient's inner world and life context, guiding them in the understanding of their emotions and problem-solving together. Prescription (also referred to as medical prescription) pertains to a written order of medication. This order can be made by a medical professional and includes a set of instructions for the treatment. The treatment regimen contains the prescription of medication with the goal of diagnosing, treating, and/or preventing a health condition (Panchbhai, 2014). Documentation refers to the stored information regarding the patient by the mental health professional and includes (1) Electronic medical records; (2) Therapy notes; (3) Psychological Reports. According to the US National Cancer Institute (National Cancer Insitute, 2023), an electronic medical record holds patient data. This data is stored digitally and is used for keeping health professionals informed and guiding the care of the patient. A medical record can include information such as (1) The health history; (2) Medication; (3) Diagnosis; and (4) Treatment. The Office for Civil Rights (Office for Civil Rights, 2017) defines therapy notes as notes written by the mental healthcare practitioner which describe and explore the topics addressed during the sessions with the patient. At last, psychological reports comprise data about the patient's mental state and can include information about one or multiple diagnoses, cognitive abilities, skills, and emotional issues, in a way that allows the patients and/or their caregivers to gain a better understanding of the patient's mental functioning. The psychological report also includes advice on aspects that pertain to the treatment of the patient (Wiener & Costaris, 2012). Monitoring can include (1) Progress Monitoring; and (2) Medication Monitoring. The first one relates to tracking the state of the patients to gain insight into their developments throughout treatment (Goodman, Mckay, & DePhilippis, 2013). This monitoring allows healthcare professionals to understand how the patient is responding to the treatment and if changes to the therapeutic approach need to be made (CarlierWessel, 2017). Medication monitoring refers to the supervision of patients\u2019 experiences and reactions to medication. Given the possible side effects and the need to find the right dose, tracking these patients is a crucial task (Southwestern Medical Clinic of Lakeland, 2023). Table 1 provides an overview of the relevant tasks per group of workers. As can be seen, the main differences can be found regarding medical prescription, which is exclusively done by a psychiatrist, and therapy, which is exclusively not done by psychiatrists. 1.3 Objectives Due to the speed at which the field of AI is advancing, the authors opted by focusing on papers published in the last 4 years, so that the conclusions of the research are based on the most recent findings. The researchers selected empirical studies as sources in order to synthesize and further develop the existing evidence. In light of the possible changes in the work context of mental healthcare workers brought about by Artificial Intelligence systems, the goal of this research was defined as the following: \u2022 To characterize the impact of Artificial Intelligence on the tasks of mental healthcare workers according to empirical research published between 2019 and December 2022. Here, impact is considered as the applicability of the AI systems created for the tasks of mental healthcare workers. This applicability concerns how well these technologies translate to real-world scenarios based on: (1) The amount of data used to train the model (i.e. the number of unique instances); (2) The original author's evaluation of the systems' contributions to developments in the field and (or) employment readiness. In order to reach the previously defined goal three objectives were specified: \u2022 To verify to what extent the application of Artificial Intelligence systems impacts the tasks of mental healthcare workers; \u2022 To describe how Artificial Intelligence systems impact the tasks of mental healthcare workers; \u2022 To identify, what are the tasks that the use of Artificial Intelligence systems impacts. The uncertainty regarding the impact of the application of AI technologies on the tasks of mental healthcare professionals emphasizes the importance of shedding light on this influence. In this context, a scoping review was the selected approach to address the objectives. 2 Method 2.1 Protocol and registration The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was used as the review protocol (Prisma extension for scoping reviews, 2018). 2.2 Eligibility criteria Regarding inclusion eligibility, the researchers agreed on the following criteria: (1) Research papers; (2) Peer-reviewed, in order to preserve the quality of the results of the study; (3) Empirical papers; (4) Publication dates from 2019 to December 2022 since AI is a quickly developing field, in order to guarantee that the conclusions were based on the most recently developed research; (5) Written in English, in order to be accessible to a wide public; (6) Includes a description of the dataset (number of participants and details); (7) Not retracted; and (8) Inside the scope of the study. The dataset had to be described allowing the researchers to verify the validity of the results of the study. Considering these criteria, conference proceedings, books, case reports, reviews, working papers, and opinion pieces were excluded. 2.3 Information sources The search was conducted on two databases: EBSCOhost with access through a Dutch public university of applied sciences and Worldcat with access through another Dutch public university. Both database sources automatically removed duplicates. However, a few duplicates still remained which were later removed manually. The search strategy was conceived and discussed by the research team. 2.4 Search Boolean phrases were constructed to filter through the articles\u2019 titles and abstracts using relevant search terms (see Table 2 ). Additionally, three filters were applied: (1) Publication date of 2019-12/2022 time frame; (2) Publication in peer-reviewed journals; (3) Written in English; (4) Publication type of \u201cJournal Article\u201d. 2.5 Selection of sources of evidence Initially, a total of 139 articles were collected. Two researchers screened the articles together starting with the title, followed by the abstract and the conclusion. The researchers discussed the inclusion/exclusion of the articles based on the research goals and inclusion criteria. In cases of uncertainty regarding the inclusion of the article, a third researcher with a background in psychology was involved in the decision process and further sections of the paper were read. During this stage, reviewing articles for eligibility involved (1) checking the publication type, (2) screening the title, abstract, and conclusion, and (3) checking the type of study. If after these steps eligibility remained undetermined (for instance, the researchers were unable to confirm a study was empirical, based on title, abstract, and conclusion), the papers were kept for a more in-depth review at a later stage. During this phase, the following data was recorded (separately for each database) in Microsoft Excel: (1) Full citations (i.e., authors, year, title, publication, and DOI); (2) Type of study (empirical/not empirical); (3) In- or excluded; (4) Reason for exclusion (if applicable) and; (5) Comments. 2.6 Data charting process The data charting was inspired by the one presented by (Pisani & Ricart, 2016). The antecedents-phenomenon-consequences model was used to gain insight into the connections between Artificial Intelligence systems and the mental healthcare worker's tasks. It allows the identification of themes regarding key factors that trigger (antecedents) the implementations (phenomenon) and implications for practice (consequences). Since the antecedents, phenomenon and consequences are documented separately paper, they can be critically assessed to determine the impact. The process was conducted by two researchers individually. When a question regarding a data item emerged, both researchers discussed the issue. When an agreement was not reached upon discussion, feedback was requested from a third researcher. Fig. 1 represents the process. 2.7 Data items In the antecedents-phenomenon-consequences \u2018Antecedents\u2019 refer to the key factors which trigger the \u2018The Phenomenon\u2019. This phenomenon pertains to the main aspects of the implementation. Lastly, \u2018Consequences\u2019 describe the Outcomes of the previously described phenomenon (Pisani & Ricart, 2016). The levels of analysis, as defined by Berg (David, 2023), were also added to the table, in order to get an overview of the focal point of the research, these included: (1) The individual level of analysis, which refers to studies that analyze phenomena through the exploration of aspects pertaining to the individual; (2) The Interpersonal level of analysis, that connects to research which examines the topic through studying the relationship between two persons; (3) The group level of analysis, which studies the topic through the exploration of features common to specific groups of people and; (4) The intergroup level of analysis that investigates phenomena through the assessment of the relation between two groups or the representatives of those groups. A table was created during this phase, which included the following information for each paper: (1) ID, a unique identifying code given to each article; (2) N, the number of data instances/participants; (3) Description, including extra information regarding the data sources: (4) Reference; (5) DOI; (6) Level of analysis; (7) Context includes the mental healthcare tasks. Here, each task was coded as a letter: Assessment (A), Therapy (T), Prescription (P), Documentation (D), and Monitoring (M). Antecedents, in which the (8) triggers are presented, pertaining to the objective of the studies. The Phenomenon covers the (8) Field of AI and (9) Key Relationships. The AI field includes Artificial Intelligence in General (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Symbolic AI (SA), and Fuzzy Systems (FS). Key relationships concern relationships/variables explored by the paper. Finally, the outcomes are covered, including (10) Outcomes of the tasks produced by the AI system(s) and; (11) Practical implications. 3 Results 3.1 Selection of sources of evidence From the 139 collected articles, 22 were excluded due to being duplicates. Following the selection criteria previously presented, 20 papers were excluded due to not pertaining to empirical research. A total of 44 papers were excluded for being outside of the scope of this project (not in the mental health context). This was the case for papers that approached other healthcare topics such as speech therapy, and radiotherapy, or topics that relate to important mental tasks, such as learning and decision-making, but that were analyzed outside of the mental healthcare sphere. Additionally, 3 articles were excluded due to describing research that did not directly connect with mental healthcare workers\u2019 tasks. Moreover, in two of the articles, insufficient information regarding the dataset was available therefore, in accordance with the inclusion criteria, the papers were removed from the project. A research proposal was also excluded, due to not including a concluded study. Finally, one article was removed due to having been retracted. A sum of 46 articles remained to be analyzed by the researchers. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the entire process. 3.2 Characteristics of sources of evidence A systematic analysis of the content of the articles was conducted. The table below presents the research papers and corresponding data. 3.2.1 Instances and data types The minimum number of instances used in the collected literature was 12 (Tsai et al., 2021) and the maximum number of instances in a data source was 275843 (Zhong et al., 2019). The interquartile range (IQR) is 1317, where the 25th percentile (Q1) number of instances was 147.5 and 75th percentile (Q3) 1464.5. From this it can be concluded that the maximum number of instances observed (275843) is an extreme outlier, skewing the summary statistics (M = 8488.83, SD = 41945.32). Noteworthy on this outlier (Zhong et al., 2019) is that the initial data source contained 275843 instances, however, for model development 400 instances were used (200 for training and 200 for validating the models and parameters) and 9331 for evaluation purposes. Removing this outlier is justified given that the dataset for the authors\u2019 study was sampled from a database containing 275843 instances, but their dataset used differed substantially, thus misrepresenting the summary statistics aimed for in this analysis. Then, removing this outlier (Zhong et al., 2019) results in a minimum and maximum sample size of 12 and 20000 respectively, with a lower quartile (IQ1) of 100 instances, upper quartile (IQ3) of 1236 instances, and a median of 340 instances These results indicate that any dataset. with more than 2943.75 (IQ3 + 1.5*(IQ3-IQ1)) instances can be considered an outlier. The figure below (Fig. 2 ) shows the resulting boxplot for the sizes of the datasets used in the described studies. The majority of articles collected data through questionnaires (18 articles), followed by images (12 articles) as the second most used source of data and textual data sources (11 articles). Survey (questionnaire) data sources included responses from individuals in a therapeutic role ((Aktan, Turhan, & Dolu, 2022; Murali Doraiswamy, Blease, & Bodner, 2020; Zhang, Zhang, Ren, & Jiang, 2021), individuals with one or more diagnoses, such as depression (G\u00f3mez Penedo et al., 2022; Solomonov et al., 2021), affective disorders (Schwartz et al., 2021), anxiety (G\u00f3mez Penedo et al., 2022; Schwartz et al., 2021) and schizophrenia (Fond et al., 2019) and individuals with alcohol dependence (SymonsGerald et al., 2019, 2020). Image data consisted mainly of EEG images (Kumar Rout, Sahani, Dora, Kumar Biswal, & Biswal, 2022; LeiAbdelkader Nasreddine Belkacem et al., 2022; Li et al., 2019; Saeedi, Saeedi, Maghsoudi, & Ahmad, 2021), images of faces (Ahmed et al., 2022; Alsaade & Alzahrani, 2022; Singh & Goyal, 2021), and images related to drawings (Cuerda, Zornoza, Gallud, Tesoriero, & Romero Ayuso, 2022; MoetesumImran et al., 2020; Nolazco-Flores et al., 2022). Regarding the articles using data sources containing texts, it was noted that, of the ten articles which used more than 2000 instances, six fit in the category of using textual data (Dheeraj & Ramakrishnudu, 2021; Ewbank et al., 2020; Levis, Leonard Westgate, Jiang, Watts, & Shiner, 2021; Tanana et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2019). Further, textual data originated mainly from therapy session transcripts (Ewbank et al., 2020, 2021; Gunjan et al., 2022; Tanana et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021), (clinical) notes (Goldberg et al., 2021; Levis et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2019), and written responses from both online (Dheeraj & Ramakrishnudu, 2021; Huang et al., 2022) and offline (Nolazco-Flores et al., 2022) sources. Other than the above three major data source types, audio was used and automatically converted to text by two articles (Cohen et al., 2020; Goldberg et al., 2020), which is not considered textual source data. One study used behavioral data collected in a virtual environment for the detection of early-stage cognitive impairments (Tsai et al., 2021). One paper extracted information from a database containing medical track records of cancer patients (G\u00fcnther, Kirchebner, Ben Schulze, von K\u00e4nel, & Euler, 2022). One article used data for evaluating the user experience of a rule-based AI chatbot (Ardiana, Joni, & Udayana, 2020). Lastly, one article (Marti-Puig, Capra, Vega, Llunas, & Sol\u00e9-Casals, 2022) used app-activity data in addition to questionnaire data collected through the app (which is included in the questionnaire count). 3.2.2 Levels of analysis and mental healthcare tasks Regarding the level of analysis, all the articles adopted an individual level of analysis, with the exception of Goldberg et al. (Goldberg et al., 2020), which included an interpersonal level of analysis. With respect to the mental healthcare worker's tasks, the vast majority of articles pertain to assessment tasks (28). such as the diagnosis of autism (e.g. Ahmed et al. (Ahmed et al., 2022)), depression (e.g. Victor et al. (Victor, Aghajan, Sewart, & Christian, 2019)), and suicide risk detection (e.g. Levis et al. (Levis et al., 2021)). Monitoring was tackled by 14 research papers, including papers that explored the supervision of a patient's emotional development (e.g. Nolazco-Flores et al. (Nolazco-Flores et al., 2022)), and the prediction of treatment outcomes (e.g. Pearson et al. (Pearson et al., 2019)). Tasks relating to therapy were explored by 7 articles, some of the topics included predicting therapeutic alliance (Goldberg et al., 2020), detecting the therapist's interpersonal skills (Goldberg et al., 2021), providing counseling (Ardiana et al., 2020), and emotion detection systems (Tanana et al., 2021). Finally, prescription and documentation were only studied by one article. Both of these tasks (prescription and documentation) were explored by Doraiswamy, Blease, & Bodner (Murali Doraiswamy et al., 2020), who analyzed perspectives on AI for mental healthcare tasks based on the opinions of physicians, see Fig. 3 . 3.2.3 Goals Regarding the Antecedents, a plurality of goals was explored. A total of 7 articles studied AI for other therapy-related tasks, ranging from more patient-directed approaches such as providing counseling (e.g. Ardiana, Joni, and Udayana (Ardiana et al., 2020)) and personalizing treatment (e.g. Penedo et al. (G\u00f3mez Penedo et al., 2022)) to more therapist-based ones. This category includes systems for detecting compassion fatigue in helpline counselors (Zhang et al., 2021) and making emotion extraction from transcripts in psychotherapy easier for therapists (Tanana et al., 2021). The prediction of treatment outcomes or relapse was another frequent objective, with a total of 8 articles. One of these papers was the one by Pearson et al. (Pearson et al., 2019), which employed a machine learning system to predict treatment outcomes for depression. Improvement in the detection of suicide risk and assessment of depression were two explored goals. The first one was the antecedent of 6 papers, most of which focused on supporting the prediction of the risk of suicide (e.g. Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2021)), and the second one focused on the assessment of depression and triggered a sum of 4 research pieces (Li et al., 2019; Saeedi et al., 2021; Singh & Goyal, 2021; Victor et al., 2019). 17 articles studied AI for other assessment tasks, such as the diagnosis of schizophrenia (e.g. Appaji et al. (Appaji et al., 2022)) and dementia (Tsai et al., 2021). Treatment personalization was explored by two research pieces such as Penedo et al. (G\u00f3mez Penedo et al., 2022), whom studied AI to personalize treatment in routine care. Lastly, Creed et al. (Creed et al., 2022) explored individuals' perceptions of AI-driven cognitive behavioral therapy, and Doraiswamy et al. (Murali Doraiswamy et al., 2020) focused on physicians' perspectives regarding the use of AI for mental healthcare workers\u2019 tasks. 3.2.4 Artificial intelligence fields Regarding the field of AI, articles most commonly explored Machine Learning techniques, with a sum of 27 articles pertaining to ML systems such as Zhong et al. (Zhong et al., 2019) whom applied Machine Learning to clinical notes, with the goal of predicting suicidal tendencies in pregnant women. The second most employed technique was Deep Learning, explored by a total of 21 research pieces. One of these papers was by Saeedi et al. (Saeedi et al., 2021), whom used DL for the early diagnosis of depression. The field of Artificial Intelligence (in general) was approached by three research papers, all of which aimed at understanding perceptions towards the usage of AI in different mental health contexts, an example is Creed et al. (Creed et al., 2022), which studied the perspectives of stakeholders regarding the application of AI for fidelity measurement in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Fuzzy systems were employed three times, such as by Dutt, Ahuja, and Kumar (DuttNeelu Jyothi Ahuja and Kumar, 2022), whom applied FS together with DL for the assessment of students\u2019 disabilities, and Symons et al. (SymonsGerald et al., 2019), who used FS with ML for predicting the outcome of the treatment of alcoholism. Finally, Symbolic Artificial Intelligence was only employed once by Ardiana, Joni, and Udayana (Ardiana et al., 2020) in the creation of an AI chatbot for HIV and AIDS counseling. Fig. 4 shows the number of articles per field of AI, where some articles may utilize systems from multiple fields. Fig. 5 shows the relative frequency of each field of AI given each task. Regarding the task of assessment, 54.5% studied systems in the field of DL, 39.4% ML. The remaining 6.1% is equally divided amongst FS and SA. Note, however, that some articles studied multiple fields of AI, such as Ni et al. (NiDrew et al., 2020) and Lyu and Zhang (Lyu & Zhang, 2019). Regarding monitoring, 73.3% pertained to the field of ML. However, since the total occurrences of the fields within the task of monitoring are 14, of which 11 pertain to ML, it would be misleading to report percentages for single occurrences for the remaining fields. As such, with regards to the task of monitoring, AI in general was the field of AI twice, while FS and DL occurred once each. 3.2.5 Key relationships Regarding the key relationships, 26 articles studied AI in connection with the diagnosis of multiple mental health conditions, including schizophrenia (e.g. Alsaade and Alzahrani (Alsaade & Alzahrani, 2022) and other mental health issues such as Acquired Brain Injuries (Cuerda et al., 2022). A sum of 12 papers explored the prediction of treatment outcomes. Here, two approaches are adopted: while some researchers focused on patient-clinician interactions, such as Ewbank et al. (Ewbank et al., 2021) who used therapy data from communications between patients and therapists to evaluate therapeutic outcomes, others employed assessment (questionnaire) data, such as Solomonov et al. (Solomonov et al., 2021) who used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960) to assess patients and predict aspects that lead to the patient not responding to the treatment. Two papers analyzed the use of AI for the training of therapists. Goldberg et al. (Goldberg et al., 2021) explored AI for the evaluation of the interpersonal skills of therapists. Creed et al. (Creed et al., 2022) studied the perceptions of stakeholders regarding the use of AI in the measurement of fidelity in cognitive behavioral therapy. Furthermore, two papers studied the use of AI to monitor patients\u2019 moods, one through the use of writing and drawing data (Nolazco-Flores et al., 2022) and the other one through the application of therapy transcripts (Tanana et al., 2021). AI as a support agent for counseling was explored in three papers, such as Ardiana, Joni, and Udayana (Ardiana et al., 2020), through the creation and evaluation of an AI-AIDS HIV counseling chatbot. In this same category, Aktan, Turhan, and Dolu (Aktan et al., 2022) studied the perceptions regarding Artificial Intelligence systems as psychotherapists. Finally, one article (Murali Doraiswamy et al., 2020) researched the perspectives of physicians regarding AI for the replacement of mental healthcare workers in the mental healthcare tasks explored in this paper. 3.2.6 Task outcomes and practical implications The researchers identified three types of task outcomes: (1) Artificial Intelligence systems that contribute to assisting and supporting mental healthcare workers in the performance of their tasks; (2) Artificial Intelligence systems that contribute to the development and application of AI in the replacement of healthcare professionals in some of their tasks and; (3) Understanding of individual's perceptions regarding AI in mental healthcare contexts. Further, the classification of systems as either tools for assisting or replacing mental healthcare workers was conducted systematically. This process was as follows: where the original authors employed terms such as \u201creplacing\u201d and (or) \u201cautomating\u201d to describe the artificial intelligence systems, those were considered as tools that replace the mental healthcare worker in one or more particular tasks. Conversely, in contexts where the original authors refer to the systems as tools to \u201cassist\u201d and/or \u201chelp\u201d, those are coded as AI systems to support mental healthcare workers in one or more tasks. The first outcome was explored by 26 papers such as (Huang et al., 2022) who successfully applied Deep Learning for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, which could aid medical professionals in identifying the level of severity of the patient's condition. A sum of 17 articles explored AI as an autonomous system for the performance of tasks. One of these articles was the one by Symons et al. (SymonsGerald et al., 2020), where the authors explored AI for the prediction of the outcome of the treatment of alcoholism. Here, AI reached a higher level of accuracy in predicting treatment outcomes compared to healthcare professionals. Finally, three articles provided insight into individuals' perspectives on AI. The paper Aktan, Turhan, and Dolu (Aktan et al., 2022) was one of the pieces that focused on perspectives regarding AI. The authors studied individuals' perceptions and individual towards help-seeking and how those relate to a preference for AI therapy. One of the points observed in this article was that even though most participants hold a higher level of trust toward human counselors, 55% of them showed a preference for AI therapy. Regarding the practical implications, most articles contributed to improvements in the field of research. However, in five instances the performance did not reach satisfactory levels, such as in Symons et al. (SymonsGerald et al., 2019) in which Machine Learning was employed for the prediction of treatment outcomes. Here, in most cases, the system's performance was not higher than chance. 3.3 Results of individual sources of evidence A selection of representative sources of evidence (as described in section 3.2) can be seen in Table 3 .3 for each tasks. Since Documenting and Prescription were only covered by one article, these have been combined. 4 Discussion For this scoping review 46 empirical studies, between the dates of 2019 and December 2022, were analyzed. Considering that the goal of this paper is to characterize the impact of Artificial Intelligence on the tasks of mental healthcare workers, according to empirical research, this section is presented as follows. First, the summary evidence is discussed. Here, each of the subgoals is examined against the results. Additionally, the several tasks of mental healthcare workers are considered, being analyzed to what extent those tasks are affected and the corresponding consequences in terms of human resource management. Second, the limitations of the current literature review are described. Third, the conclusion is presented. Here, conceptual propositions for stimulating future studies are shared. Furthermore, some research gaps are identified and the corresponding future studies are proposed. 4.1 Summary of evidence Artificial Intelligence concerns systems that aim to replicate human reasoning (Millington, 2019). These technologies are expected to greatly transform work contexts (Bughin et al., 2017) and are currently already being explored for mental healthcare tasks (Tom et al., 2019). In light of increasing the understanding of how these systems impact mental healthcare workers\u2019 tasks, this paper examined that impact on tasks of psychologists, therapists/counselors, and psychiatrists. The impact of AI on assessment, therapy, prescription, documentation, and monitoring was explored through the analysis of the literature. Peer-reviewed, empirical research papers written in English were included. Further, it was required that articles include a description of the dataset used. The findings and supporting arguments are summarized in Table 4 and will be discussed next. First, from the antecedents-phenomon-consequence model it is clear that a need for improvement triggered the application studies of AI integrated into the mental health care setting (antecedents). It was found that only four of the reviewed articles state that their systems are not ready for implementation into practice yet. This indicates that AI is currently impacting and may increasingly impact the tasks of mental healthcare workers. However, the majority of articles use few instances to develop their systems, ranging from 100 to 1236 instances. A minority used anywhere between 2944 to upwards of 20000 instances, with an exceptional case with a database consisting of 273843. This large database, however, had yet to be filtered for relevant cases, reducing the final sample size from 273843 to 400 instances for model development. The small sample sizes are an issue, given that if the number of instances is low, while the number of features is relatively large, it becomes increasingly more difficult to reliably capture meaningful information in the feature space, in addition to generalizing to a larger population. However, most AI systems originated from the field of Machine Learning (27) and Deep Learning (21). Machine Learning systems generally perform well on small datasets, while Deep Learning systems perform well when on high-dimensional data (Janiesch et al., 2021). Thus, given that (1) a need for improvement triggered research, (2) the majority of systems originated from within the field of Machine Learning, which require less data than deep learning systems, and (3) only four out of 46 papers stated their systems are not ready for real-world application, it is reasonable to assume that AI has and will have an impact, which answers the first sub-goal of this paper. This leads to the next (second) subgoal, to establish, in case there is an impact, how Artificial Intelligence will affect the tasks of mental healthcare professionals. Firstly, as mentioned, the number of instances used for model development reduces the systems\u2019 capabilities to generalize and capture information in the feature space, thus making them less reliable to function independently. Secondly, most articles (26 in total) were aimed at assisting and supporting mental healthcare workers. This is much more than the number of articles (17 in total) targeting systems capable of replacing mental healthcare workers in their tasks. Following these two points, it is reasonable to assume that AI systems will be incorporated into the tasks of mental healthcare workers more than replacing them, or, at least, the authors show more attention towards aiding professionals versus replacing them. The implication of that to the HRM in mental healthcare is that intensive training interventions are required to make professionals able to use AI in their jobs. Furthermore, since it is a fast pace evolving field, expertise is required for mental healthcare organizations, maybe experts in AI specifically applicable to the mental healthcare context. The remaining (third) subgoal is to identify the tasks that Artificial Intelligence systems impact. The results show that the majority of studies addressed the tasks of assessment (n = 28), monitoring (n = 14), and therapy (n = 7). Medical prescription and documentation were explored by only one article (Murali Doraiswamy et al., 2020), which was a survey study and, as such, not focused on developing an AI system. In it, the authors found that physicians rated the likelihood of AI systems replacing psychiatrists in a series of tasks, of which documentation-related tasks were estimated as most likely. This contrasts with what the aforementioned results suggest: research is disproportionately focused on assessment tasks. Monitoring and therapy were less explored, but still present in some of the articles. Thus, it is estimated that Artificial Intelligence is most likely to transform the tasks of assessment, monitoring, and therapy. Overall, most papers focused on employing AI technologies for aiding mental healthcare workers, however, a portion of the papers test the employment of fully automated systems. The majority of studies displays promising results, which shows that these could become valuable tools for increasing professionals\u2019 abilities within their work context. Regarding assessment, AI systems can classify patients, currently mainly through analyzing questionnaire, image, or text data. The systems can detect a series of mental health conditions such as suicidal tendencies, depression, and autism. It is expected that these systems could (1) speed up diagnosing patients, and (or) (2) find paths of further inquiry. A similar thing can be said for the task of monitoring, where systems can aid in estimating a patient's development and inform mental healthcare professionals of the expected treatment outcomes. Here, the reviewed papers explored ranged from general approaches, such as forecasting psychotherapy outcomes and detecting patients' mood, to more specific treatments, such as the monitoring of the treatment of alcoholism. This indicates that these systems could contribute to improvements in the delivery of treatment and the identification of variables associated with positive therapeutic results. It is expected that by mastering AI and using it in assessment tasks, mental healthcare workers can focus on the therapeutic process, since the assessment is performed primarily by the system. Furthermore, using AI in monitoring in supervision processes allows the supervisor and the supervisee to check their subjective perception against the objective record. This way, the use of AI can improve the professional development provided by supervision processes. Lastly, with respect to the task of therapy, AI systems can transform this task by providing live feedback regarding the client's emotional state as well as providing insight into variables regarding patient-therapist interactions, such as therapeutic alliance which could contribute to the training of professionals. Regarding perspectives toward the use of AI for training, stakeholders considered these tools as useful but are uncertain about their abilities to capture some important information, like the nuances of non-verbal communication. Some studies are already trying to capture these nuances, such as Singh and Goyal (Singh & Goyal, 2021), which used video data to detect depressed subjects achieving a precision of 64. Although this precision level is not high, it might be improved in future studies. One research paper also employed an AI chatbot for AIDS/HIV counseling, suggesting that these systems could become helpful as autonomous systems for therapy (Ardiana et al., 2020). However, such an application raises ethical concerns, such as the fact that AI is limited in the type of empathetic care it can provide. The remaining tasks, documenting and medical prescription, were only explored by articles that examined the perspective of individuals regarding the use of AI for those tasks. So far, no transformation in these tasks is expected in terms of AI integration. However, when dealing with AI systems in mental healthcare tasks, patients express their ideas and perceptions regarding these systems. They can reject, accept, or even prefer dealing with AI Systems. Consequently, those who reject the system because they perceive it ineffective or threatening do not cooperate in an effective and positive interaction. Thus, that perception makes the system weak. Contrariwise, those who accept or prefer to deal with AI systems cooperate and make the system effective. Therefore, pa perceptions of AI Systems impact how healthcare workers perform their tasks to use those systems properly with those patients, It can be expected that therapy assessment and monitoring may become grounded in stronger and more reliable indicators through the use of AI systems, making it possible for the professional to focus on the quality of the therapeutic interaction without missing relevant data. Moreover, professional development such as that promoted by supervision practice can be improved by introducing AI systems that help the professional in tasks that are highly attention-demanding but are not specifically therapy and treatment. In Fig. 6 , the AI tasks impacted and type of impacts are presented. 4.2 Limitations This study has some limitations. Firstly, the evaluation of the level of performance of the AI systems was fully based on what was stated in the research papers. Neither the quality nor the accuracy of the original claims was assessed. For instance, one of the papers (Ardiana et al., 2020) assessed their system using a usability study and concluded that the system helps in counseling based on the results that (1) a correct answer to information-related questions was given 71% of the time, and (2) that users rated the usability of the system positively. The relationship between whether a system's usability is good and the effectiveness of counseling was not clarified, nor was the minimum level of accuracy required for a system to be helpful in counseling. Another article (Appaji et al., 2022) developed a system that could correctly identify schizophrenia in 95% of the cases but added that the system is not ready for real-world application. These examples highlight the different standards set in terms of system performance and deciding on its effectiveness. Lastly, very few papers compared AI systems to human performance, such as Ni et al. (NiDrew et al., 2020), resulting in very little comparative insight into the performance of these technologies. For instance, perhaps 71% correctness could be considered good if shown that humans perform much worse on the same task, while 95% accuracy might be very poor if humans are close to 100% accurate. These examples highlight the different standards set to assess whether a system could replace a mental healthcare worker, or support them in, a particular task. Secondly, and in connection with the previous points, many studies include a small number of data instances, making it more difficult to generalize based on the results. Thirdly, the details added to the table were in accordance with the original papers. For this reason, it is important to mention that in the article by Dheeraj and Tene Ramakrishnudu (Dheeraj & Ramakrishnudu, 2021), there was an incorrect claim. Mental problems, such as addiction, were classified as emotions. It was noted that this information was questionable but the table was kept in line with the original piece for consistency. Fourthly, regarding the level of autonomy of the explored AI systems, while it is true that some of these systems can perform tasks independently, that does not imply that they should replace the mental healthcare worker. On one hand, this is due to the importance of the presence of the professional for a series of aspects surrounding their tasks, such as providing empathetic care to patients during their treatment. According to Moudatsou et al. (Moudatsou et al., 2020), individuals working in therapeutic contexts who possess higher levels of empathy achieve better results in their functions. However, AI systems do not have the same abilities for empathy as humans (Montemayor et al., 2022) On the other hand, due to the fact that the skills of AI and humans complement each other, highlighting the potential of hybrid intelligence (Dellermann et al., 2018). As stated by Kamar (Kamar, 2016), humans already play an important role in the training of these systems. An alternative argument could be made that AI systems not presented as fully automated may become so later on. An example can be seen in the assessment of autism, accuracy level of 95% was achieved in the best-performing model [5]. Therefore, even though mental healthcare professionals are mentioned as an important part of the process, these technologies might be applied to execute some of these tasks autonomously in the future. Finally, another limitation of this literature review is the disregard of publication bias. Since it would be time demanding and affect the authors\u2019 ability of delivering a scoping literature review in a fast-evolving field, the required procedures to check possible publication bias were excluded. In future literature reviews that bias should be checked. 4.3 Conclusions Overall, AI shows promising results for application in mental healthcare. Currently, most developments in this field aim to support mental healthcare workers in their tasks, namely assessment, monitoring, and some on therapy. These observations highlight the importance of considering the social and economical implications of the implementation of these systems for mental healthcare and the professional's role in the context of these new technologies. Considering these results, the following propositions are presented: Proposition 1 Providing adequate training to mental healthcare professionals to increase their skills using AI systems in assessment and monitoring tasks improves the quality of the therapeutic process. The rationale for that proposition is that the use of AI enables them to focus on therapeutic and treatment functions instead of focusing their attention on other demanding tasks (for example assessment). Proposition 2 In light of AI\u2019s application for supporting workers, it might be relevant to train individuals on the functioning of these new technologies, in order to guarantee the proper use of these systems and enable positive outcomes, such as the reduced burden on mental healthcare systems and increased support of mental healthcare professionals while avoiding some possible drawbacks. Negative outcomes of the application of these systems could include an increase in job losses and reduced quality of services caused by, for instance, a lack of empathetic care. Future studies should focus on the following topics: (1) To explore the application of Artificial Intelligence for tasks such as medical prescription and documentation, which were not applied by any of the research pieces present in this literature review; (2) It is also relevant to compare systems\u2019 performance to that of human beings and to test their accuracy in hybrid contexts, in order to gain deeper insight into the benefit of the use of these technologies. Furthermore, it is important (3) to look into ways of safeguarding empathy in the context of AI-supported mental healthcare and to measure the implications of autonomous AI-driven therapy systems, to; (4) To study the consequences of the implementation of these technologies in real-world scenarios. Finally, it is crucial to research (5) how to implement these systems considering the work context of professionals, by, for instance, exploring possible training programs, their social impact on workers, and other related practicalities.

The large amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activities, especially the emission of carbon dioxide, is an important driving factor behind climate issues. Under the background of China\u2019s \u201c3060\u201d decarbonization goal\u201d, Chongming District in Shanghai is actively promoting the construction of a world-class ecological island and is committed to creating a carbon\u2013neutral demonstration zone with global influence. However, Chongming District faces challenges as the mechanism of carbon-neutrality transition path remains unclear. The data related to evaluating carbon neutrality status are heterogeneous from multiple sources. It is difficult to effectively implement relevant evaluation and response measures, impeding the progress of its low-carbon transformation. In response to the aforementioned challenges, this paper will propose and discuss the potential methods based on the new generation of information technology, represented by big data and artificial intelligence. These technologies aim to facilitate the integration of diverse factors, including carbon, and explore the nexus among them, thus exploring pathways for low-carbon transformation, and ultimately achieving decarbonization goal in Chongming District. Hopefully, the research conducted in this paper will contribute to the efforts of China and the global community in addressing carbon-related challenges and advancing towards a more sustainable and low-carbon future. Keywords New generation of information technology Big data Artificial intelligence Deep learning Multi-element nexus 1 Introduction In the present era, climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity. With rapid social, economic, and technological developments, the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, particularly carbon dioxide emissions, are increasing at an alarming rate, becoming a major driver of global climate change. As a responsible major country, China has put forward the \u201c3060\u2033 decarbonization goal (Wang and Zhang, 2020) and has called for localized research on the evolution mechanisms and patterns of carbon neutrality in typical regions. In the context of the \u201c3060\u2033 decarbonization goal, selecting Chongming District as a testing ground and breakthrough point for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality holds significant importance. On the one hand, as the only world-class ecological island in China, Chongming District relies on its unique geographical location and natural resources to embrace a low-carbon, green, and eco-friendly development approach. This strategy has led to significant progress in policy formulation and practical implementation, particularly in areas such as energy utilization, energy conservation, emission reduction, and low-carbon transformation (Li et al., 2020). On the other hand, when compared to other cities that are building low-carbon demonstration zones, Chongming District still lags behind in economic development, transportation, technological advancements, and several other aspects. It is confronted with many challenges on the road to achieve the decarbonization goal, including unclear paths, relatively insufficient infrastructure construction, and poor ability to comprehensively coordinate various elements, etc (Luo et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2018). However, being situated within the radiance of the Shanghai metropolitan area, Chongming District holds immense potential for low-carbon and eco-friendly urbanization and industrialization. In fact, its scale in constructing a world-class ecological island surpasses that of any other low-carbon city construction project. Therefore, if a successful low-carbon transition pathway can be established in Chongming District, it will provide valuable experience for the high-quality development of the Yangtze River Delta region and the entire country. It will also serve as a new model for green and low-carbon transformations in developing countries, contributing to the global decarbonization goal. With the development of information technology and the Internet, we have entered an era of data explosion. A massive amount of data is continuously generated, and as the scale of data expands, traditional data analysis and processing techniques are facing limitations and bottlenecks. These massive, multi-source heterogeneous data can bring rich information and value to evaluating the carbon neutrality status, but at the same time put forward new requirements for high-performance computing, storage technology and analysis technology. In recent years, the rapid developing new generation of information technology, such as artificial intelligence and big data, has shown their immense potential for applications in various disciplines and interdisciplinary research. Therefore, integrating new-generation information technologies like big data and artificial intelligence into the evaluation of carbon neutrality status is of great importance (Rabah, 2018; Misra et al., 2020; IoT and cloud, 2020; Zhang and Lu, 2021). Previous studies have indicated that big data and artificial intelligence technologies play a significant role in evaluating carbon neutrality status, particularly in data monitoring, carbon emission and absorption calculations, process forecasting, decarbonization pathway planning, and policy implementation (Chen et al., 2021). However, the majority of these existing studies have only focused on exploring the application potential of individual technologies within specific domains, such as the use of artificial intelligence in promoting carbon reduction in the energy industry. There is a lack of a comprehensive system that spans multiple domains and includes the entire process of data acquisition, storage, management, analysis, validation, and application. This paper delves into two aspects: big data technology and artificial intelligence technology. Firstly, we discuss the limitations of traditional methods in acquiring and processing carbon-related data. Subsequently, based on big data and artificial intelligence technology, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework which cover the entire process of data acquisition, storage, management, analysis, validation, and application. This framework has the potential to unveil the nexus among various elements, including social, economic, ecological and geographical aspects, and promote their integration with carbon related elements in Chongming District. By identifying and establishing the inherent correlations between different elements and carbon neutrality status, a more comprehensive and accurate system for evaluating carbon neutrality status can be established, which will ultimately help the realization of the decarbonization goal. 2 Harnessing the power of big data technology: Acquisition and management of heterogeneous multi-source data for carbon neutrality 2.1 The limitations of traditional approaches in acquiring and storing heterogeneous multi-source data In today's digital world, the application of big data continues to penetrate and expand across various fields, demonstrating unprecedented insights and innovative potential in the process of social, economic, and technological development, and bringing enormous opportunities. However, along with these opportunities, there also come a series of challenges. On the one hand, big data holds tremendous potential in uncovering intricate nexuses and patterns that may remain hidden in small-scale data. On the other hand, the characteristics of big data, such as large volume, high dimensionality, and heterogeneity, put forward new and higher demands for data acquisition and storage (Fan et al., 2014). Traditional data analysis methods face certain challenges in monitoring, evaluating and managing carbon neutrality status, which primarily arise from factors such as data disorder, isolation, and lack of collectiveness (Chunming et al., 2015). These limitations make it challenging to integrate data and conduct comprehensive analysis. Therefore, in order to enhance the monitoring, evaluating and management of carbon neutrality status in Chongming District, it is necessary to adopt new data acquisition technologies and methods to capture the hidden patterns, promote the integration, and conduct correlation analysis of diverse data and elements. Furthermore, traditional storage systems are not designed to handle these huge data, so they cannot effectively store and process big data. In the face of big data, traditional data storage systems present several challenges, including: read-write patterns, storage costs, proprietary hardware costs, complexity, data heterogeneity, applying data to programs, etc (Faridoon and Imran, 2021). In order to deal with these problems, new data storage and processing mode architectures are proposed (Casado and Younas, 2015; Chen et al., 2014; Mehmood et al., 2019). By adopting these new technologies, large-scale data related to carbon neutrality status can be effectively stored, retrieved and managed. The combination of advanced data storage capabilities and innovative data acquisition approaches provide data support for conducting in-depth analysis of the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District. 2.2 Multi-source heterogeneous data acquisition system In the era of big data, data acquisition is a fundamental step in conducting research related to data analysis, involving the retrieval of data from diverse sources, including private sources, as well as public sources (Chaulagain et al., 2017). So, it is crucial to employ various tools and technologies for data acquisition. With the widespread use of the Internet, the amount of data available online has experienced a rapid growth, and manual data retrieval becomes highly inefficient, leading to a decline in competitiveness (Khder, 2021). Based on the aforementioned situation, web crawling technology has emerged. Web crawling, also known as web scraping or web spidering, is an automated technique for extracting information from the internet. By simulating the behavior of a human browser, web crawlers automatically access web pages, extract data, and store it locally or in other target locations. It frees people from manual data retrieval tasks, enabling computer applications to efficiently and accurately gather web data (Lawson, 2015). The advantages of web crawling have made it widely used in both commercial and scientific research fields. Hillen (Hillen, 2019) conducted research on food prices using web crawling, demonstrating the immense potential of web scraping in the field of food price analysis. Vording (Vording, 2021) pointed out that high-quality and large-scale data obtained through web crawling can optimize decision-making in market pricing, trend analysis, and research and development. He (He, 2014) utilized web crawling techniques to acquire carbon information disclosed by companies on public platforms. By combining index methods and multiple linear regression models, she obtained the Carbon Disclosure Index (CDI) and explored its relationship with factors such as company size, industry sector, and company nature, making a significant contribution to China's decarbonization goal. These studies have made significant contributions by demonstrating the ability of web crawling to acquire diverse and heterogeneous data, which is valuable for subsequent analysis. Also, it is worth mentioning that the use of satellite remote sensing data for detecting and evaluating carbon dioxide level has been a recent focus of research. Previous studies have demonstrated the significant progress made in utilizing satellite remote sensing data for understanding climate change (Yang et al., 2013), inverting and estimating carbon dioxide concentrations (Hong et al., 2022), monitoring and evaluating wetland resources (Ozesmi and Bauer, 2002), and facilitating global biodiversity monitoring by involving experts from various fields (Pettorelli et al., 2018). Considering the above research results on data acquisition methods and the characteristics of Chongming District, we propose a data acquisition framework which contains web crawling technology and \u201cSpace-Sky-Ground\u201d integrated monitoring system. The \u201cSpace-Sky-Ground\u201d integrated monitoring system for data acquisition refers to a comprehensive approach that utilizes various data sources to capture information for the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District. In this system, \u201cSpace\u201d represents the utilization of satellite remote sensing data to acquire macro-scale data. \u201cSky\u201d refers to the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to capture medium-scale data within specific geographic areas. \u201cGround\u201d involves the deployment of various ground-based sensors to collect smaller-scale data in proximity to the sensor installation sites. Fig. 1 shows the proposed data acquisition Framework. For the multi-source heterogeneous data acquisition framework, we will discuss the specific data that can be collected by each of the components below. Web crawling can help us access the following publicly available data on the Internet: \u2022 Chongming Statistical Yearbook and monthly bulletin. Including comprehensive social data of Chongming District (e.g. population size, GDP, major economic indicators, etc.), basic production and gross output value of industry and agriculture, living and production situation of different townships and green ecological indicators. \u2022 Data from public monitoring sites in Chongming District. Including daily weather conditions, air quality, and other data publicly released by monitoring stations. These data can serve as specific supplements to the statistical yearbook, effectively reflecting the changing trends of various elements and carbon emissions. \u2022 Company information data. Including the basic business information of companies (e.g. industry sector, economic scale, and geographic location, etc) as well as the enterprise's self-disclosed data (e.g. carbon emissions, energy consumption, and wastewater and gas emissions, etc.). These data can be utilized to establish the relationship between production patterns and carbon emissions for subsequent analysis. \u2022 Real-time Internet data. This mainly includes real-time data obtained from various websites, web platforms, social media, and other channels, capturing market trends, public engagement, carbon reduction policies, and other relevant information. These data can assist in understanding the current status of the public's practice of carbon emission reduction (Yang et al., 2021), and at the same time can be used as a complementary basis for evaluating the low carbon transition process (Chen et al., 2022). For the \u201cSpace\u201d in the Space-Sky-Ground\u201c integrated monitoring data acquisition system, we can acquire the following data: \u2022 Data on topography of different areas of Chongming District. Previous studies have shown that differences in soil organic carbon stocks in different parts of the terrain, as well as differences in the intensity and rate of weathering under different terrain conditions, will have an impact on carbon cycling and carbon evaluation (Berhe et al., 2008). Therefore, it is necessary to use satellite remote sensing image data to obtain topographic data of different areas as an important reference for carbon evaluation. \u2022 Forest-related data. Forest can absorb and fix atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, thereby playing a significant role in carbon sink. So these data can make an important contribution to estimating the forest carbon dioxide flux in Chongming District (Cho et al., 2021). \u2022 Land-related data. Chongming District is primarily dominated by agricultural industry, and the characteristics and changes in land use intensity and coverage types are closely linked to the total carbon emissions and trends (He and Zhang, 2022). \u2022 Wetland-related data. On the one hand, wetlands are a significant Terrian type in Chongming District. On the other hand, wetlands have a strong carbon sequestration capacity and are also a source of methane emissions (Oikawa et al., 2017). \u2022 Coastal organism data. Chongming District is surrounded by the ocean, and it possesses abundant \u201ccoastal blue carbon\u201d resources, including salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds, which have a strong capacity for carbon fixation and storage (Wylie et al., 2016). Leveraging remote sensing image enables the detection and evaluation of carbon distribution in different regions of Chongming District. For the \u201cSky\u201d in the Space-Sky-Ground\u201c integrated monitoring data acquisition system, we can obtain the following data related to enterprises, agriculture, nature reserves and other parks (hereinafter referred to as \u201dparks\u201c). \u2022 Airborne gas composition within the parks. The drone can accurately obtain the level of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the air within the park area by carrying a variety of gas sensors. These data can be used to validate the accuracy of data derived from other indirect methods. \u2022 Infrastructure-related data within the parks. Due to the ability to transmit real-time video and image data, drones can perform real-time inspections of infrastructure in enterprises and agricultural parks, such as power supply networks, transmission pipelines, and fishery-lights complementary facilities. By collecting these data and establishing the relationship with greenhouse gas content in the air, it is possible to enhance the efficiency of infrastructure utilization and promote its development towards high efficiency and low carbon emissions. \u2022 Soil-related data with the parks. The interaction between crops and soil is mutual. On the on hand, the conditions of crops will affect the storage and content of soil organic carbon (Zhang et al., 2019). On the other hand, soil rich in organic carbon can reduce the application of fertilizers during the crop growth cycle, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, organic carbon resources can be developed and utilized to replace fossil energy. Therefore, the condition of soil and crops is closely related to the carbon cycle of the whole park ecosystem and should be treated as an important element for carbon evaluation. For the \u201cGround\u201d in the Space-Sky-Ground\u201c integrated monitoring data acquisition system, we can obtain the following data of a specific monitoring point: \u2022 Basic environment parameters. Including temperature, humidity, light intensity, etc. Considering that Chongming District is mainly based on agricultural industries, these environmental parameters are closely related to agricultural production factors such as crop growth and soil conditions. \u2022 Production energy consumption and emission parameters. Including power consumption, wastewater discharge and composition, waste gas discharge and composition, etc. Firstly, as one of the major energy consumers in the production, electricity comes mainly from fossil fuels, the combustion of which releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. Secondly, agricultural and industrial production generates a large amount of wastewater containing various organic and inorganic compounds, the biochemical decomposition of which releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Lastly, the content and composition of exhaust gases obtained by ground sensors can be used to supplement the data obtained by satellites and UAVs. Through the above data acquisition system, we have obtained various types of data relevant to evaluating the carbon neutrality status of Chongming District. To ensure the quality of the acquired data, we also need to clean and standardize the data (Rahm and Do, 2000; Gal and Rubinfeld, 2019). For non-image data, we can use the \u201cPandas\u201d library in Python to perform operations such as handling missing values, handling outliers, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, converting data types, and performing numerical normalization and standardization (Brownlee, 2020). For image data, such as satellite remote sensing data, Python also provides libraries like \u201cGDAL\u201d for data cleansing and standardization, performing operations such as data cropping, resampling, merging, splitting, and format conversion (Garrard, 2016). Based on the above analysis, web crawlers provide efficient support for obtaining social and economic data related to the carbon neutrality status of Chongming District released publicly on the Internet. At the same time, the \u201cSpace-Sky-Ground\u201d integrated monitoring data acquisition method composed of satellite remote sensing data, UAV telemetry data and ground sensor data has achieved complementary advantages in obtaining various types of data related to the geography and ecology of Chongming District. Furthermore, by cleansing and standardizing the collected data, the accuracy and completeness of the data is significantly improved and the efficiency of data storage is enhanced. This whole system provides macro, local, and micro-scale data support for the carbon neutrality evaluation in Chongming District. 2.3 Multi-source heterogeneous data storage and management scheme The data acquisition system based on \u201cSpace-Sky-Ground\u201d integrated monitoring and web crawling data acquisition system provides a rich and valuable data resource for monitoring and evaluating the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District. However, traditional relational databases have encountered bottlenecks in the storage of these unstructured multi-source heterogeneous data (Subramaniyaswamy et al., 2015). Traditional SQL data uses expensive mapping frameworks and complex algorithms to solve the problem that the data model cannot match the relational model. This is unacceptable when dealing with real-time, heterogeneous, and large-scale data required for evaluating the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District (Hecht and Jablonski, 2011). Therefore, a new storage strategy that is suitable for the characteristics of big data is required. Currently, in order to cope with the challenges posed by big data to storage management technology, significant progress has been made in the research on NoSQL (not only SQL) (Siddiqa et al., 2017). NoSQL, as a feasible solution, overcomes the problems of traditional relational databases, and has the advantages of fast reading and writing data, supporting massive storage, easy expansion and low cost (Khan and Mane, 2013; Han et al., 2011). Among them, Google developed Google File System (GFS) (Ghemawat and Gobioff, 2003) and Bigtable (Chang et al., 2008) based on large-scale distributed data management methods and distributed multi-dimensional array mapping technology. These two systems cooperate with each other in Google's infrastructure, providing efficient data storage and management capabilities for various Google services. In addition, the research and application achievements of GFS and Bigtable have contributed to the rapid development of distributed data management concepts, giving rise to systems such as the distributed file system Hadoop (Borthakur, 2008), the data storage solution for big data, HBase (George, 2011), and the distributed database Hypertable (Khetrapal and Ganesh, 2006). MongoDB, which belongs to the NoSQL category, is a good choice for storing and managing the big data related to the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District. MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database that provides a flexible distributed data storage and management solution, focusing on document-oriented data, with high reliability, availability, scalability, and responsiveness (Plugge et al., 2015). MongoDB encompasses three key elements: Database, Collection, and Document. In this context, a Database serves as the physical container for Collections. Collections, in turn, consist of Documents that possess similar or related attributes. Users have the freedom to define the names of their Documents. Within a given Collection, Documents are not required to share the same set of fields or structure, and common fields can accommodate data of varying types (Chauhan, 2019).Due to the data used to evaluate the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District combines various elements such as society, economy, ecology, and geography, it possesses characteristics of heterogeneity and unstructured nature. Consequently, personalized storage formats need to be defined according to specific requirements. While traditional relational databases like SQL do not support fully customizable storage based on user needs (Gy\u0151r\u00f6di et al., 2015), MongoDB offers a suitable solution. MongoDB, with its document-oriented approach, not only satisfies the requirement for customization but also provides robust querying capabilities comparable to SQL. Fig. 2 shows an exemplary utilization of MongoDB as a robust and flexible data storage solution. In summary, NoSQL provides innovative solutions for storing and managing large-scale data in the context of data. Among them, MongoDB database offers advanced technical capabilities for storing and managing heterogeneous carbon data from multiple sources in the context of integrating various elements in Chongming District. It is known for its scalable distributed architecture, flexible data storage model, and high-performance real-time querying and updating functionalities. Based on the data storage and management approach of MongoDB, it effectively supports the storage, querying, and real-time updating of carbon neutrality data in Chongming District. Together with \u201cSpace-Sky-Ground\u201d integrated monitoring and web crawling, it forms a complementary system. This system provides ample data resources and robust data management methods. It serves as an innovative foundation and vital support for the application of artificial intelligence technology in unveiling the nexus of diverse factors. Furthermore, it enables in-depth analysis to evaluate the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District. 3 Exploring the potential of artificial intelligence technology: Evaluating carbon neutrality status and exploring low-carbon transition pathways 3.1 Limitations of traditional carbon evaluation methods In the context of global climate change, low-carbon emissions have become a well-established topic worldwide. Since the last century, international organizations and institutions such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have been actively engaged in research on greenhouse gas emissions inventories Their efforts have aimed to facilitate carbon control and optimize carbon strategies worldwide in response to the challenges of climate change (IPCC, 1996; IPCC, 2006; ISO, 2018). Consequently, numerous subsequent studies have revolved around the theme of low-carbon emissions reduction.Lu et al. (Lu et al., 2011) developed a low-carbon evaluation framework for the implementation of low-carbon urban development in Tianjin, based on the city's carbon emission mechanism and key influencing factors, combined with expert consultations. They established a statistical table of weights for the low-carbon planning index system and an evaluation table for the current status and planning of low-carbon indicators, providing a basis for low-carbon evaluation in Tianjin. However, this low-carbon evaluation method has limited indicators and a relatively crude model, making it difficult to uncover the connections among different influencing factors and form an integrated evaluation system that incorporates multiple factors. Additionally, the involvement of experts is required in this evaluation system, which hinders the efficient establishment of a carbon evaluation system involving multiple factors, especially in the context of big data. Nosheen et al. (Nosheen et al., 2020) used the extended STIRPAT model to assess the energy consumption and urbanization of Asian countries on carbon dioxide emissions and environmental quality, and verified the feasibility of the method. Although statistical models such as STIRPAT provide a scientific basis for understanding and predicting carbon emissions and environmental quality, such statistical models mainly rely on predetermined influencing factors and linear relationship assumptions, which may make it difficult to capture the underlying complex nonlinear nexus of different factors (V\u00e9lez-Henao et al., 2019). Similarly, when utilizing remote sensing data for environmental parameter monitoring and analysis, the process of establishing physical models heavily relies on prior knowledge (Yuan et al., 2020), which introduces a high level of complexity. Previous research has made certain achievements in the evaluation of carbon emissions and environmental conditions. However, these methods still have certain limitations. when faced with large-scale, multidimensional and heterogeneous data from various sources, these methods and models exhibit low processing efficiency and struggle to capture the complex nexus and nonlinear patterns inherent in the data. Additionally, they require different domain expertise and experience for modeling in different application scenarios, lacking a unified and easily understandable modeling framework. Therefore, it is crucial to explore an approach that can capture and establish the hidden correlations among various factors such as social, economic, ecological, and geographical aspects. This approach should enable the comprehensive extraction of data value and accelerate the low-carbon transformation of Chongming District, leading to the successful achievement of decarbonization goal in a high-quality manner. 3.2 The application potential of artificial intelligence technology in evaluating carbon neutrality status In recent years, there have been remarkable breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technology. AI is not limited to a specific field but represents a revolutionary and transformative technology with the potential to empower various domains (Lyu y-g., 2020:). It has the capability to enhance and revolutionize every aspect of science and technology. At present, under the decarbonization goal of \u201c3060\u2033 decarbonization goal and \u201dArtificial Intelligence 2.0\u2033, it is a natural and trendy choice to apply artificial intelligence technology to evaluating carbon neutrality status (Pan, 2016). Deep learning, as one of the most important branches of artificial intelligence technology, has surpassed human capabilities in various application domains and scenarios (Shrestha and Mahmood, 2019). Examples include AlphaGo (Granter et al., 2017) in the field of Go, ResNet (He et al., 2016) in image recognition, and Google's cancer detection models (Liu et al., 2017). Inspired by the success of deep learning in computer vision (Voulodimos et al., 2018), natural language processing (Young et al., 2018) and multimodal learning (Summaira et al., 2021), we believe that artificial intelligence technologies represented by deep learning models can facilitate the integration of diverse factors related to carbon neutrality in Chongming District. They can also uncover the underlying nexus and latent patterns that are difficult to predict based on prior knowledge. In the following discussion, we will focus on deep learning methods to explore and analyze the potential of AI technology in evaluating the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District. Fig. 3 shows a potential applications of AI technology in the evaluation of carbon neutrality status in Chongming District. 3.2.1 Deep learning models help to uncover the value of sensor data The \u201cSpace-Sky-Ground\u201d integrated monitoring system provides abundant sensor data resources for evaluating the carbon neutrality status in Chongming, including satellite remote sensing images, UAV telemetry data, and ground-based sensor data. Currently, many researchers have carried out research on deep learning in processing remote sensing image data (Zhu et al., 2017). Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2019) used deep learning methods to effectively classify land cover and land use from high-resolution remote sensing images. Yuan et al. (Yuan et al., 2020) proposed that deep learning can be utilized to detect and simulate parameters in complex environments using remote sensing data, especially for those environmental phenomena that lack or are difficult to establish physical models. Similarly, deep learning techniques have also been applied to process UAV telemetry data. This includes the use of deep learning for processing UAV video imagery to identify and monitor human activities (Geraldes et al., 2019), as well as the development of an artificial intelligence system for disaster relief UAVs using semantic segmentation and task detection models (Speth et al., 2022). In addition, data fusion has been an important research area in the field of remote sensing (Zhu et al., 2017; Alparone et al., 2007; Schmitt and Zhu, 2016; G\u00f3mez-chova, et al., 2015). Currently, mainstream research focuses on two levels of fusion strategies: Feature-Level and Decision-Level. Feature-Level fusion involves merging different input data from various sources using a certain combination method and feeding them into deep neural networks for training, thereby extracting relevant features of interest. On the other hand, Decision-Level fusion combines the output of different models to obtain the final output (Zhu et al., 2017). Both of these strategies provide insights into fusing heterogeneous data from multiple sources and are of great reference value. Based on the above discussion, when evaluating the carbon neutrality status of Chongming District, we believe that the deep learning models provide a solution for mining the value of massive and heterogeneous sensor data. Due to the capability of deep learning models to automatically learn and extract various features from heterogeneous data sources, they can be utilized for processing satellite imagery and UAV telemetry data, as well as various ground-based sensor data. Considering the characteristics of sensor data, a feasible evaluation approach is as follows: Deep neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (Lecun et al., 2015) can be used to extract features related to the terrain conditions, land use, vegetation coverage, and water conditions in Chongming District from satellite remote sensing and UAV telemetry image. By using deep learning models like Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), specifically designed to handle time-series data, we can effectively analyze temperature and humidity variations across different time periods and regions, as well as evaluate atmospheric composition, including pollutant levels and carbon dioxide content. Furthermore, we can gain insights into human activities related to production, such as fertilizer management, wastewater discharge, and energy consumption. By this step, we are able to extract valuable features from diverse data. Ultimately, an encoder-decoder model such as Autoencoder (Tschannen et al., 2018) can be used to remove redundant information in high-dimensional feature data and acquire low-dimensional feature vectors that retain the main information. Through the above processing steps, it is possible to extract features from various data sources in Chongming District, including ecological environment and economic production. These features can then be used to capture and establish the nexus with data related to carbon emissions and carbon sequestration, which are crucial for evaluating the carbon neutrality status. 3.2.2 Large language model has the potential to extract the value of online data Web crawling offers a rich source of online data for evaluating the carbon neutrality status in Chongming District, encompassing data from government statistical yearbooks, corporate disclosure reports, and other relevant sources on the internet. These data exhibit characteristics such as wide-ranging sources, complex formats, low relevance, abstract and difficult-to-quantify content, making it challenging to directly employ deep learning models for processing and analysis. Recently, large language models represented by ChatGPT have made great progress and significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing tasks (Abdullah et al., 2022). Biswas et al. (Biswas, 2023) analyzed the potential contributions of ChatGPT in the research of global warming, providing support for the feasibility of using large language models in evaluating the carbon neutrality status of Chongming District. Therefore, we propose a method that utilizes large language models to extract the value of relevant online data. First of all, data such as government statistical yearbooks and corporate disclosure reports are usually presented in a structured format, and the application of large language models can help quickly identify and extract various information and indicators, and output them in a specified form. In addition, by inputting personalized prompt instructions based on specific needs (White et al., 2023), we can extract abstract information related to the decarbonization goals in Chongming, such as real-time emission reduction targets, mitigation actions, and public participation from various online platforms including government policy reports, news, and social media. This information can be condensed into concise textual outputs that retain the key information. Then, we are able to extract the desired content from the complex and diverse web data, thereby enhancing the efficiency and quality of data filtering and processing. Furthermore, for further analysis of these data, we can utilize deep learning models to extract features from the outputs of large language models. Specifically, numerical outputs can be processed using convolutional neural networks for feature extraction, while textual outputs can be handled using models like BERT (Devlin, et al., 2018) for text encoding and feature extraction. Through these operations, the heterogeneous and abstract web data from multiple sources are transformed into feature vectors that can be trained using deep learning methods. It is worth noting that large language models, such as ChatGPT, will sometimes provide false information (Tsigaris and Teixeira da silva, 2023:) and carry the risk of data leakage (Aiyappa et al., 2023). Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the generated results and avoid uploading sensitive and confidential data when using them. This is also why our proposed approach primarily focuses on publicly available data sources on the internet. 3.2.3 Enabling comprehensive evaluation of carbon neutrality through contrastive learning and graph neural networks The utilization of deep learning models and large language models enables the processing and exploration of sensor data and web data, providing a technological foundation for obtaining feature representations of diverse and heterogeneous data from various sources. However, it is important to consider that the mentioned deep learning models primarily rely on supervised learning methods, which require labeled signals, such as carbon emission data, to train the neural network and obtain feature representations. In the context of evaluating carbon neutrality status, the availability of such labeled signals is often limited or insufficient. This limitation diminishes the efficacy of supervised learning approaches in these cases. To address this limitation and mitigate the dependence on labeled data, the incorporation of unsupervised learning techniques becomes imperative. By introducing unsupervised learning methods, we can utilize the nexus within the data itself to extract informative representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a type of deep learning model that operates on graph-structured data. By representing the three key elements of a graph, namely nodes, edges, and global context, as feature vectors and using deep learning methods, GNNs can effectively capture and model the features and relationships among nodes. This makes them applicable in various domains for analysis purpose (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019; Xv et al., 2020). The contrastive learning method, represented by MoCo (He et al., 2020), can be used to train models in the absence of labeled signals. By constructing positive and negative sample pairs, this method effectively brings similar samples closer together while encouraging dissimilar samples to be separated, facilitating meaningful feature representation learning. Drawing inspiration from successful applications of contrastive learning and graph neural networks (Yu et al., 2021; Xia et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2023), we propose a novel approach for comprehensively evaluating the carbon neutrality status in the Chongming District. Our approach combines the power of GNN and contrastive learning, and aims to overcome the challenges of training supervised learning models in scenarios with limited labels. When evaluating the carbon neutrality status of the Chongming District, we can construct \u201cgraphs\u201d based on different application scenarios. These scenarios encompass both small-scale environments such as individual businesses and industrial parks, as well as large-scale settings including towns and villages. Additionally, to address the issue of insufficient data and missing data in different application scenarios, we can introduce some prior knowledge as constraints and convert the problem into an edge-level prediction task, thereby reducing the reliance on data volume and integrity (You et al., 2020; Borate et al., 2023). Below, we will present a general evaluation framework applicable to different scenarios, using enterprise applications as an example: Firstly, the data from different enterprises will be categorized and summarized based on a yearly or other time interval. For example, it can be divided into the following categories: \u2022 Enterprise business information such as enterprise size, industry classification, products produced, and geographical location. \u2022 Enterprise production process information including production parameters, material information, equipment details, and energy consumption information. \u2022 Enterprise emission information covering wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and various types of gas emissions. Each type of data and the relationships between them have a learnable latent representation vector. Using these representation vectors, we construct a set of graph data. These graph data are combined based on different time intervals and enterprises, forming a large-scale graph dataset for model training. Specifically, we can first create graph data for different time points of the same enterprise, treating them as positive samples. Then, we consider graph data from different enterprises and time points as negative samples. By using contrastive learning methods, our model learns to effectively capture the distinctive features of elements within the same enterprise and establish feature disparities across different enterprises. Additionally, to enhance the training, we can introduce a limited amount of graph data that contains carbon emission-related information. This data can include known carbon emission levels from specific years or data from enterprises that disclose their carbon emissions. By integrating such data, we introduce a novel framework that synergistically combines self-supervised and semi-supervised methods (Zhu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2019), leading to the expected performance improvement. Furthermore, through training process, we can acquire feature representations that encompass fundamental information, production patterns, and carbon emission patterns of different enterprises. These representations unveil the nexus among these various elements, allowing us to establish meaningful correlation between them and carbon emission patterns. Ultimately, a comprehensive multi-factor evaluation framework for evaluating the carbon neutrality status of enterprises can be established. 3.3 Exploring low-carbon transition pathways with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology The application of artificial intelligence technology in evaluating carbon neutrality status enables us to facilitate the coupling of various factors inherent in multi-source and heterogeneous data and establish their nexus to carbon neutrality. Many of these nexuses are challenging to model using traditional approaches or discover and interpret through prior knowledge. However, artificial intelligence technology provides a solution to capture and establish these nexuses, thereby assisting professionals from diverse domains in exploring low-carbon transition pathways. Specifically, the inherent connections among these elements offer researchers fresh inspiration and valuable insights. They serve as a complement to the existing knowledge in the field of carbon evaluation and provide a foundation for exploring novel research avenues. By comprehensively considering the factors involved across diverse data sources, researchers can delve into the intricate connections and underlying mechanisms that related to carbon neutrality status evaluation. This exploration will unravel the influential factors, key drivers, and limiting constraints, shedding light on the complex dynamics that underlie low-carbon transformation. Meanwhile these emerging research directions can foster increased scholarly exchanges and collaborative efforts. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze diverse data, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research and collaborations can be pursued. This enables a profound exploration of the interconnections and interactions between carbon neutrality and various academic disciplines, including society, economy, ecology, geography, and more. Furthermore, stakeholders including governments, businesses, and social organizations committed to the decarbonization goal can use models developed by artificial intelligence techniques for carbon emission trend forecasting, production demand forecasting, low-carbon technology prediction, policy impact assessment, and social engagement evaluation. This big data-driven artificial intelligence technology framework will be applied and verified in the practice of low carbon transition in Chongming District based on the project \u201cResearch on Intelligent Monitoring, Evaluation and Response Technology for Carbon Neutrality Status in Chongming District\u201d. For example, the carbon emissions of a region or an enterprise predicted by the artificial intelligence model will be compared and verified with the results projected by the carbon evaluation experts using the corresponding professional methods, and the artificial intelligence model will be further verified and optimized based on the subsequent measured data and the professional opinions of the experts. In addition, potential nexus between elements captured by the AI model will be verified and analyzed by experts in different fields through research and experiments. The newly discovered elements and relationships that are verified to be informative and valuable will be treated as important considerations for subsequent carbon monitoring, evaluation and response. In summary, the application of artificial intelligence technology fosters the establishment of a more comprehensive and inclusive carbon neutrality evaluation framework. It empowers decision-makers and participants from diverse stakeholders by providing precise data and robust model support, enabling them to explore low-carbon transition pathways with greater precision. The feasibility and performance of AI models will be further verified and improved by cross-validating with expert research results in actual practices. This, in turn, guides the formulation of effective low-carbon policies and the implementation of impactful carbon reduction initiatives. Ultimately, it serves as a driving force towards the achievement of the decarbonization goal. 4 Conclusion This paper addresses the challenges and obstacles faced by Chongming District in evaluating the carbon neutrality status and promoting low-carbon transition. To tackle these issues, we propose a solution based on next-generation information technologies, with big data and artificial intelligence at the forefront. Our approach involves the creation of a comprehensive data acquisition framework that combines web scraping and \u201cSpace-Sky-Ground\u201d integrated monitoring system. Additionally, we explore the potential applications of artificial intelligence techniques, including deep neural networks, large language models, graph neural networks and contrastive learning, to handle various data patterns effectively. By implementing these strategies, we can effectively acquire diverse and heterogeneous data sources, enabling us to capture the nexuses between different elements and establish meaningful connections among them. This integration of carbon neutrality and its associated elements fosters a more comprehensive evaluation framework in Chongming District, promoting a holistic understanding of the carbon neutrality status. Hopefully, our innovative approach will provide valuable insights for establishing Chongming District as a carbon\u2013neutral demonstration zone and achieving the committed \u201c30-60\u201d decarbonization goal.

Abstract Artificial Intelligence is increasingly being discussed as something essential and pressing in all aspects and areas of society. Its potential use in education is no exception. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, and technologies, in general, are unavoidable elements to be considered in the teaching-learning process at all levels of education and training. There are many initiatives, essentially exploratory in nature, for the application of Artificial Intelligence in this process. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how they can be used for this purpose and how they relate to pedagogical methods. In the present study, and within this context, we address how Artificial Intelligence can be used in software to support cognitive and motor development and stimulate reasoning. We propose a reference model for techniques for this purpose. Concrete cases of existing applications are presented to better illustrate the potential of Artificial Intelligence in education. 2021 The uthors.

Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies for teaching are spreading and being used more and more because of their advantages. [2,16,33]. The establishment of the Beijing Consensus [29], which is the first AI and education document adopted by UNESCO member states, has brought to the attention of education leaders and policymakers worldwide the recognition of the urgency to discuss and define the future of education. As a result, AI in Education (AIED) - the intersection of the AI and education domains - has become a strategic priority in many countries [30]. However, there are barriers to its effective and widespread use. For example, Wang and Cheng (2021) identify barriers in secondary schools in Hong Kong, findings that can be generalized in the sense that they are not culturally dependent. If we look at the actual situation in most of the various schools and training centers spread throughout Portugal, we see that its use is not yet as widespread as one would expect. In this paper, we refer, in particular, to what concerns the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques to support the cognitive and motor development of children and adolescents and stimulate their reasoning. There are different strategies for building Artificial Intelligence, and it is possible to use each one or a combination of them to address different specific problems. In solving some types of problems, only a few strategies are possible. In other problems, there are several alternative paths. Artificial Intelligence is a vast area of computer science composed of different specialty subfields. These domains include Automatic programming, Planning; Learning; Reasoning; Natural language; Problem-solving, Search, Genetics and Evolution, Knowledge representation, Vision, Simulation and social modeling, Speech, Affective computation, Demonstration of theorems; Artificial life, among others. Regardless of the area or subarea, it is possible to identify three base approaches for building intelligent systems: the computational or symbolic, the connectionist, and the biological [9]. The Symbolic or Computational approach is based on a computational metaphor, in which intelligence is defined by the sum of processes that simulate reasoning and computational structures. In the so-called connectionist approach, intelligence is considered an emergent property of the interactions of a large number of elementary processing units, usually neurons or artificial lymphocytes, that simplistically replicate the functioning of their biological counterparts. The biological approach is based on the computer simulation of Darwin's theory of natural selection of species. The \"intelligence\" emerges from the evolution and learning of a species of artificial individuals in each context. Physical and motor development can be understood as the development of a child's or adolescent's motor skills. In children, everything referring to the act of crawling, walking, running, grasping objects, sucking, eating, drinking, etc. In adolescents, it is the biological part of the body that transforms throughout life [11]. Regarding cognitive development, in the context of this text, we refer essentially to Jean Piaget's theory of cognition development [18], i.e., the set of brain/mental capacities necessary to obtain knowledge about the world that involves thinking, reasoning, abstraction, language, memory, attention, creativity, and problem-solving skills, among other functions. Activities that stimulate reasoning are understood as all activities that directly or indirectly encourage and promote the development of reasoning [25]. Good examples are games (chess, checkers, go, ...), hobbies (crossword puzzles, sudoku, ...), puzzles (Cluedo, ...), curiosities (history, science, ...), and challenges (competitions, self-overcoming, ...). We seek to answer whether technologies based on Artificial Intelligence can help in physical and motor development and stimulate reasoning. It is known that, with respect to physical and motor development, they have an enormous potential to complement the work of a teacher/tutor, for example, obtained by participating in games that require increasing motor coordination, agility, and speed. Regarding the stimulus to reasoning, for example, by making games more \"intelligent,\" hobbies and puzzles more dynamic and challenging, they contribute relevantly to the learner's facing increasing difficulties and thus receiving an evolving stimulus adjusted to the learner's evolution [3]. This paper presents a proposed reference model for using AI techniques to stimulate reasoning and cognitive and motor development. We better illustrate the potential of AI in education by presenting some cases in which, using the application of Artificial Intelligence in well-known contexts, platforms are obtained that enhance physical and motor development.

Methodology We used the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology for this work. DSR is an approach with growing relevance in information systems research based on the construction of an artifact (in this case, a reference model) that aims to ensure answers to the questions posed by the study problem [19]. Since we intend to design and implement an artifact, we consider this to be the most appropriate methodology for its elaboration, implementation, and critical analysis of the results. The artifact is the central element of the Design Science Research (DSR) and must be well tested, understood and documented to ensure its pragmatic validity. The evaluation is a central phase of the process, in which the usefulness, quality and effectiveness of the artifact are demonstrated, using well-executed evaluation methods. The sequence of steps provided in the methodology is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. DSR sequential activities [19]. In the form of a reference model, the artifact to be proposed will be materialized by the collection and analysis of AI application cases in stimulating reasoning and cognitive and motor development. After this phase, we will validate it through interviews with experts. With this collected data, we will process it, incorporate the identified improvements, and conclude. 3. Artificial Intelligence technologies in teaching It is always tricky to predict the future. However, it is possible that technologies currently in use will see their use expanded and that technologies of growing importance, such as Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality, will be progressively integrated into schools. There are countless cases of Artificial Intelligence being applied to support teaching and education, allowing teachers novel ways of teaching-learning and increasing the efficiency of the whole process [28]. The Internet has enabled a large proportion of children to access quality teaching platforms and content. These collaborative platforms and teaching aid applications allow access to school material and communication; and support knowledge sharing between school institutions in all areas and different languages [8]. They can be used on all computer operating systems, mobile devices, and the Internet [4]. An example of context for the use of AI techniques is known as MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses). This system allows several students to have access to numerous courses, making it possible, for example, for a teenage boy from Bangladesh to attend a digital circuits course remotely and learn other subjects that do not exist in schools in his/her country. Another technology related to mobile devices is E-books (electronic books). All material is available 24 hours a day, there is a text search functionality, and the portability of texts is an advantage [6]. Furthermore, the availability of specialized periodicals and scientific and literary texts, libraries, music, films online, despite the controversy related to copyright and intellectual property and the consequent impact and challenges posed to the sustainability of markets, will definitely contribute to broadening and disseminating knowledge [23]. Besides the existence of virtual libraries, museums, and countless sites for sharing music, videos, films, or series, there are multiple thematic sites and ad hoc offers focused on authors, geographies, and even works. Artificial Intelligence will increasingly have a decisive say. Noteworthy are automatic translation systems, which are already fundamental in breaking down language barriers, the support systems for the development and stimulation of reasoning in children and teenagers (intelligent tutors, games, ...), and the support systems for motor development. In this last case, a good example is the Nintendo Wii, which through movement sensors, helps improve the motor 1060 Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 219 (2023) 1057\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10664 Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 activities of students, namely those with Autism and Down Syndrome. Another instance is the game Wii Fit, which can help individuals with difficulties in movement and balance through a platform because it offers instant feedback on the movements performed on the platform. In addition, technologies for automatic translation from sign language to spoken language and from spoken language to sign language will remove traditional accessibility barriers for mute and/or deaf students. 4. Artificial Intelligence use cases in teaching 4.1 Physical and motor development There are many examples of the use of AI, in association with other types of technologies, to support physical and motor development. It is easy to find illustrative cases in the education of children and young people, in sports, and the support of people with special needs, from dexterity support (fine motor skills), to training and preparation of high competition athletes or intelligent software with self-adaptation of interfaces for special users [21,22]. Usually, AI techniques appear together with other important technologies. In particular with the so-called Virtual Reality and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies [7, 27]. The first is a rapidly expanding and already relatively advanced technology that allows the simulation of real-life or fictitious environments. It has already been consolidated in applications in several areas, such as education, health, and entertainment. There are several types of Virtual environments: The \"fully immersive\" ones where everything is virtual objects; the \"Augmented Reality\" ones where immersion in the real world is affected by the addition of virtual elements; and the \"non-immersive\" ones where the virtual environments are seen through windows (the screens). The second, IoT, constitutes a set of emerging technologies that can be defined as a network connecting various technologies through the Internet and allowing communication and the exchange of information between different devices and systems. With the spread of Artificial Intelligence techniques, the progressive introduction of IoT-based intelligent systems can be expected [14]. However, it cannot be said that the education sector is at the forefront of adopting smart IoT technologies. A school that uses smart devices promotes a more advanced level of personalized learning [20]. These devices that use Wi-Fi to receive instructions and send data can help students utilize key school resources, create more innovative lesson plans, secure campuses, and improve access to information. Several examples and application cases can be considered. One example is wearable technology on students in a school that automatically counts students as being present, late (they are on school premises but not in their class), or absent (they are not on school premises) when the bell rings. With that information, the system will determine the information for the parents and provide links to the elements of the subject matter that the student missed. These same wearable devices can also help determine when the class is too tired or becomes inattentive and in need of a break, and the smart boards will record all the notes taken in a class. The inclusion of smart microphones in this solution will even allow it to recognize when a teacher mentions that there is a homework assignment due and update the students' calendars accordingly. An excellent example of using IoT to support students' physical and motor development is the use of performance monitoring sensors in physical education (see example in Fig. 2). These sensors collect data that can be analyzed by AI systems and teachers and be translated into adaptive practices, such as changing the pace of practice and training for better energy management and increased performance.

Shoe-based wearable sensors. These types of applications can also be considered game-changers, as they provide a large number of educational games that provide exciting features and possibilities in teaching and learning and thereby aid cognitive development. 4.2 Reasoning stimulus Also, with regard to stimulating reasoning, there are multiple examples of the use of Artificial Intelligence, either, for example, by applying 3D systems or by applying natural language processing [10,13]. Next, we analyze three relevant cases that we consider significant insofar as they allow the use of AI in stimulating reasoning. Chess In recent years, technological advances have made it possible to investigate better which factors are related between chess and human cognitive abilities. The first to study and relate chess with human intelligence was the French psychologist Alfred Binet, who is considered the father of intelligence tests. In 1894, he conducted studies where he asked chess players to describe how they reasoned during a chess match [5]. Play helps develop skills considered relevant to cognitive development. These skills include logical thinking, concentration, strategy, patience, memory, mental and physical control, and the perspective of future scenarios, which are useful for decision making. Artificial Intelligence techniques in chess games date to the 60s/70s. Even then, using techniques from Game Theory and \"Alpha-Beta pruning\" search tricks, computers managed to rank among the top 100 in the world at the tournament level. In 1982 the Belle Chess Computer, which included special circuits for motion generation and evaluation, achieved a score of 2250, with beginners having about 1000 and the world champion at 2750. In 1987 Hitech System's system, capable of evaluating 10 million positions per move, defeated the world champion. In 1990 Deep Thought 2, with a capacity to evaluate 500 million positions per move, was among the top 100 globally. In 1995 Deep Blue (1024 specialized parallel chips) could analyze one billion positions per second. Today, an advanced Artificial Intelligence system, such as Google's Alpha Go Zero, can learn and master the game of chess in 24 hours to the point of defeating world champions [12,32]. Cluedo Cluedo (also known as Clue) is a mystery game for three to six players created by Anthony E. Pratt of Birmingham, England. The game was first manufactured in 1949 in the United Kingdom. The game's objective is to determine who murdered the game's victim (Dr. Black), the location of the crime, and what weapon was used. Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and tries to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion (see Fig. 3) and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players. It is possible to establish deductive reasoning starting from the clues, which can be reproduced by an AI system, leading to discovering the culprit. For example: 1062 Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 219 (2023) 1057\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1066 6 Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 Fig. 3. - Cluedo game board Similar work was presented and discussed by Aartun in 2016 in his dissertation, demonstrating how Cluedo knowledge actions can be formalized in dynamic epistemological logic, in this case, implemented in Prolog [1]. 4.3 Artificial Life and evolutionary computer games The study of artificial life (A-Life) focuses on creating and evolving organisms and systems like living systems. The material from which artificial life is produced is inorganic, and its essence is information. Computers are test tubes in which new organisms are produced [24]. When the primary purpose of a game is to teach/train, the players should have increasing challenges that allow them to evolve. So it is expected that when they mature in their way of playing, their \"opponent\" will do the same. On the other hand, each player has a different \"game strategy,\" meaning that the \"opponent\" must follow a different strategy for each case. For this purpose, Artificial Life techniques can be a good idea [15,26]. Let us imagine, for example, an aim training game where it is intended that the player, by trying to shoot a given type of duck (e.g.,), can improve his intelligence, strength, and agility via the game (see Fig. 4).

Reference Model for using Artificial Intelligence techniques to stimulate reasoning and cognitive and motor development Based on the literature review and the cases described, it was possible to ascertain two critical elements. One is to realize the multiplicity and dispersion of techniques and areas, and the other is the lack of aggregation and the usefulness of having a reference model for the use of AI techniques in the teaching context. With the analysis of the cases, elements were possible to build a reference model for this purpose. This circumstance highlights the need for a reference model, as shown in Table 1. Table 1. AI techniques reference model in stimulating reasoning and cognitive and motor development Reasoning stimulus Cognitive development Motor development A pp lic at io n A re as o f A rt ifi ci al In te lli ge nc e Games Games of intellect (chess, Cluedo, Go,) Strategy gaming, gamification Action games (e.g., Duck Hunt) IoT (Internet of Things) Monitoring and feedback systems (e.g., Image acquisition) Monitoring and feedback systems (e.g., Image acquisition) MOOCS Smart Tutors, Affective Computing, Assessment e-Learning Intelligent Tutors Intelligent Tutors, Affective Computing Virtual Reality Spatial Reasoning development systems Simulators Simulators, Avatars Learning Analytics Intelligent Data Analytics (Data Mining, Deep Learning,\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) I Intelligent Data Analytics (Data Mining, Deep Learning,...) Intelligent Data Analytics (Data Mining, Deep Learning,...) The reference model crosses different areas of artificial intelligence application techniques (table rows) with the areas of the teaching-learning process under study (table columns). The crossing of the rows and columns of the table corresponds to the identification of the types of technologies that, according to what has been studied, can be used in each situation. Teachers and tutors can use the reference model to select the tools that best fit their teaching strategies 6. Validation As shown in Table 2, a questionnaire was created based on the analysis vectors and questions to evaluate this reference model. 1064 Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 219 (2023) 1057\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10668 Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 Table 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Questions to validate the proposed reference model. # Vector Analysis Question Q1 Relevance How relevant and/or essential do you consider the existence of the now proposed reference model? Q2 Usefulness In your opinion, will the proposed reference model be useful for educators, teachers, trainers, trainers, ....? Q3 Completeness In terms of completeness, how do you rate the reference model? Q4 Use Do you consider the proposed reference model simple to use? Q5 Improvements What recommendations/suggestions would you indicate to be able to improve the reference model? Q6 (Generic) Do you have any other comments you can provide on the proposed reference model? Interviews were conducted with three professionals in the education field, covering secondary education, higher education, and vocational training. Table 3 summarizes the answers obtained to each of the six questions Table 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Answers to the reference model validation questions. # Answers Q1 It seems useful to me. One talks about AI but does not know how to apply it. This also helps in the decision to build tools. The reference model may make sense for beginners, but it would need to be further developed for those who are teachers or trainers. I find it pertinent as it organizes/systematizes the use of AI in various application areas. Q2 Very useful. It works like a map, where I quickly find what I'm looking for. It adapts to the current supply. It will be useful only as general guidelines for approaching AI in education/training. In my opinion, it is useful because it facilitates the choice of the most appropriate tools according to the objectives to be achieved. Q3 I think more areas and ideas could be added. I think the reference model needs to be further developed and deepened; there are areas that overlap (e-learning and MOOCs) and others that are not there (Augmented Reality, for example). I can't think of any important elements that are missing in the reference model. Q4 Yes, it is useful. Yes, it seems simple in a purely informative approach. I find it accessible, although some of the terms used are not familiar to all teachers. Q5 In MOOCs, you can put intelligent tutors in the reasoning part, for example, when the MOOCs have exercises to detect a sequence of wrong answers from the student/trainee. As improvements, there should be more comprehensiveness in the application areas and more objectivity in the educational options. Explanation of some of the terms used (e.g., Affective Computing). Q6 - Maybe it is better to use other matrices as a basis and adapt them. Perhaps give examples of tools that fit each case. An analysis of the answers obtained determines that the proposed reference model is pertinent, although it needs to be developed further in some particular situations. We, therefore, understand the need to provide more detail, particularly explanatory, about it. It is also verified that the reference model is useful and unanimously recognized. Regarding completeness, there is flexibility to include other tools, and it is indicated that there is room for development in this area for future work. At the same time, the reference model is simple to use, although it includes some terms with which not all potential reference model users will be familiar. Thus, several suggestions for improvement were made, and ways of introducing them into the proposed reference model were indicated. 7. Conclusions As Niemi (2021) mentioned, AI has the ability to change the landscape of learning while recognizing the need to specify the application scenarios of AI in education further, particularly in stimulating reasoning and cognitive and motor development [17]. Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 219 (2023) 1057\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1066 1065 Vitor Santos et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 9 This paper sought to discuss how Artificial Intelligence can be used in systems to support cognitive and motor development, stimulate reasoning and suggest concrete ways to implement these strategies. Tangible examples were presented in which the application of Artificial Intelligence promotes physical and motor development and stimulates reasoning. Based on the study and rigorous analysis of these examples, a proposal for a reference model for the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in stimulating reasoning and cognitive and motor development was presented. Although there is still a long way to go, it is already clear today that Artificial Intelligence can play a vital role in systems that support cognitive and motor development and stimulate reasoning. However, we realize that the link between pedagogy and technology is often absent from the debate about AI-driven teaching tools. It is, therefore, possible to foresee that, in the future, this role may become more relevant and that new forms and even more ambitious projects will be born. Regarding future work, we can mention two distinct areas. On the one hand, the application of the proposed reference model and the observation of the results obtained through this application. On the other hand, throughout the texts we used as references for this work, we can see, either implicitly or explicitly, that there is a growing popular belief that AI will one day surpass human intelligence. Although it is not part of this work's objectives, we believe it is pertinent to mention the importance of examining whether this common belief translates into negative psychological and behavioral consequences when individuals evaluate that AI performs better than them in cognitive and intellectual tasks. This effort would be to continue the existing clues in the work of [31]. References [1] Aartun, V. I. (2016).

Its potential use in education is no exception. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, and technologies, in general, are unavoidable elements to be considered in the teaching-learning process at all levels of education and training. There are many initiatives, essentially exploratory in nature, for the application of Artificial Intelligence in this process. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how they can be used for this purpose and how they relate to pedagogical methods. In the present study, and within this context, we address how Artificial Intelligence can be used in software to support cognitive and motor development and stimulate reasoning. We propose a reference model for techniques for this purpose. Concrete cases of existing applications are presented to better illustrate the potential of Artificial Intelligence in education.

The main task of the AI-based methods applied to managerial functions is to optimize their processes which are abundant in enterprises [8]. Generally, AI algorithms are believed to make certain predictions more accurately than human agents. For example, improved predictions of consumer behavior and demand for manufactured products can enable companies to produce just as much as the market needs instead of creating surplus (stock) products stored in warehouses. Such an application of AI optimizes the use of environmental resources and costs [9]. Another example of using AI in sustainable management is the optimization of purchasing green energy from its producers in terms of dynamically changing demand for green energy in the enterprise. AI algorithms can efficiently analyze the price and amount of energy consumed and stored versus market price to optimize energy self-sufficiency and, therefore, reduce the environmental and carbon footprint of the company's activities [10]. It appears that opportunities for enhancing sustainability are embedded within various managerial processes in organizations. Despite the growing utilization of AI in management functions, they were by far mostly approached with specific, tailor-made AI models for isolated problems they were built to address. However, there is a rapidly growing interest in development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - highly capable AI with broad knowledge that can rival or even surpass human agents in previously-human-only tasks, including management of organizations [11]. Even such an advanced synthetic agent is expected to be a part of the digital world (as opposed to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd world humans and organizations live in) so, in the spirit of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153garbage-in garbage-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd notion rooted in data science [12], it will be necessary to provide the digital agent with equally accurate, valid, and complete digital data - a digital representation of the real organization, its environment, and phenomena occurring within them. This paper draws inspiration from the recent success of large language models, such as GPT, LLaMA, or BERT, which have demonstrated the potential of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (a subset of AI algorithms) to synthesize vast amounts of information and provide a user with easy access to the knowledge via a conversational interface. Notably, the large language models derived their success from the abundance of digitalized knowledge that they could be trained with [13]. A similar approach, utilizing mathematical models of an organization and its environment along with ML algorithms, could allow a user to grasp phenomena occurring in the organization and its environment. Yet, it is important to note that data required by managerial functions, e.g., soft skills, emotional intelligence, or implicit knowledge, cannot always be effectively expressed with words, and requires more abstract digital representation. Consequently, there is a growing need for identification of mathematical models that can provide a holistic representation of an organization, encompassing both its internal structure and its interactions with the environment, which can be then used as foundations for a generalized ML model. The aim of this paper is to identify the link between the key management functions and the theory of ML modeling that could lead to automation of the key management functions. To achieve this, the authors critically reviewed a body of literature of the three themes, found in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, augmented with Google Scholar searches (limited to highly cited articles): \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 management functions, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 business applications of machine learning, and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 organization and its environment in organizational studies. 2. Management functions The purpose of this chapter is to provide a review of the existing management literature on the functions of management in organizations that could be addressed with ML. The chapter examines the key management functions and highlights the relevance of these functions in contemporary organizations. The review of the literature is organized into the following sections: planning, organizing, leading, and controlling [14], and summarized in Figure 1. Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4795\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4804 4797 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa, Grzegorz Krzos / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 3 Figure 1. Functions of a manager. Source: Own elaboration based on [14]. 2.1. Planning Planning is the process of setting goals and determining the best way to achieve those goals [14]. Drucker emphasized that planning is a vital function of management as it sets the direction for the organization and aligns its activities with its objectives. Mintzberg [15] challenged the conventional notion of planning as a linear, top-down process and proposed that planning should be a continuous, learning-oriented activity. In the context of planning as described by Drucker and Mintzberg, the ability to forecast future events is crucial. The process of setting goals, devising strategies to achieve them, and allocating resources all require a level of foresight about potential future outcomes. They bring an anticipatory dimension to the planning process, emphasizing the need to make informed predictions about future conditions. Furthermore, Mintzberg's notion of planning as a continuous, learning-oriented activity necessitates an ongoing assessment of future scenarios to adjust plans and actions in a dynamic manner. 2.2. Organizing Organizing involves defining and grouping tasks, assigning authority and responsibilities, and allocating resources to achieve organizational goals [14]. Organizing is essential for establishing a clear organizational structure that facilitates coordination and communication between different departments and units. Galbraith [16] introduced the concept of organizational design, emphasizing the importance of creating structures that enable organizations to adapt to their environments. With his notion that the optimal structure is one that best facilitates environmental adaptability, organizing can be conceptualized as an optimization problem of an efficient assignment of tasks, delegation of authority, and allocation of resources within certain constraints. 2.3. Leading Leading entails influencing and directing actions of organizational members to achieve the goals [14]. The literature on leadership is vast and encompasses a wide array of perspectives, including trait theories [17], behavioral theories [18], contingency theories [19], and transformational leadership theories [20]. One of the most significant contributions to leadership literature is Burns' [21] distinction between transactional and transformational leadership. Transactional leaders focus on maintaining the status quo by rewarding or punishing employees based on their performance, while transformational leaders inspire and motivate employees to exceed their potential and achieve higher levels of performance. Especially in the latter case, leadership is a complex 4798 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4795\u00e2\u20ac\u201c48044 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa, Grzegorz Krzos / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 process that extends beyond hierarchical models and relies heavily on human interactions. It is seen as a dynamic process that emerges from interactions, not just a trait inherent to certain individuals. This viewpoint underscores the complexity and sophistication of leadership, highlighting that it operates as an adaptive, collaborative system, and hence necessitates an equally dynamic and multifaceted approach to modelling [22]. 2.4. Controlling The term \"control\" is often defined as the process by which managers ensure that resources are obtained and used effectively and efficiently in the accomplishment of the organization's objectives [23]. Controlling involves monitoring of organizational performance, comparing actual results with planned outcomes, and taking corrective action if necessary [14]. Drucker highlighted the importance of control systems in providing managers with feedback on the organization's progress toward its goals. Kaplan and Norton [24] introduced the Balanced Scorecard, a widely adopted performance management tool that measures organizational performance across multiple dimensions, such as financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth. In addition to the Balanced Scorecard, there exists an abundance of other tools that aid in performance management. For instance, Key Performance Indicators [25] provide a general framework with quantifiable measurements that reflect the performance level of an organization in achieving its objectives. Total Quality Management [26] is a management approach to long-term success through customer satisfaction. The Economic Value Added [27] metric, on the other hand, offers a perspective on financial performance by determining the company's economic profit. In this context, controlling can be seen as a structured, to some extent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mechanical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd process. 3. ML applications and problem formulation In recent years, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to address a wide range of specific, managerial tasks has increased significantly. Several studies have demonstrated the power of ML algorithms in various domains, including but not limited to finance [28], marketing [29], and human resources [30]. This chapter aims to review some of these cases and outline the importance of formulating a problem in numerical form, specifically as vectors, in order to solve it with machine learning. In finance, machine learning has been applied to tasks such as credit scoring, fraud detection, and portfolio optimization. One notable example is the study by Kraus and Feuerriegel [28], which explored the application of ML algorithms for predicting stock prices. The authors used various ML techniques, such as random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning, to forecast the stock prices of various companies. They transformed the problem into a numerical form by representing the stock prices as vectors and using historical price data as input features. The study demonstrated that ML algorithms can significantly outperform traditional time-series models in predicting stock prices. In marketing, ML techniques have been employed to improve customer segmentation, predict customer churn, and optimize advertising campaigns. A study by Ngai et al. [29] investigated the use of ML algorithms for customer relationship management. The authors identified several key data mining methods used in customer relationship management which represented the problem in numerical form (e.g., as vectors): neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression, clustering, association rules, self-organizing maps, and genetic algorithms. These techniques were employed to analyze customer data and predict their behavior in order to develop a competitive CRM strategy that acquired and retained potential customers while maximizing customer value. In the realm of human resources, ML has been used for employee selection, retention, and performance prediction. Chien and Chen [30] applied ML algorithms to predict employee turnover based on pre-hire assessments. The authors represented the problem in numerical form by analyzing human resource data using a data mining framework, which employed decision tree algorithms to extract rules between applicants' profiles and their work Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4795\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4804 4799 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa, Grzegorz Krzos / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 5 behaviors. Their results indicated that ML algorithms could effectively predict employee turnover and offered better accuracy compared to traditional linear models. ML excels in uncovering complex patterns, relationships, and trends that may not be apparent with traditional methods, even when their amount is excessive. However, as discernable in the aforementioned studies, the common theme is the importance of formulating a problem in numerical form, specifically as tensors (a generalized form of mathematical vectors and matrices), to effectively apply ML techniques. This involves converting the domain model (along with both input and output data) into a series of features represented by numbers. 4. ML and management functions in an organization The review of literature on the management functions revealed that the realm of organizational management is fraught with intricate, multidimensional, and intertwined issues. These complexities span across the different functions, from planning to organizing, leading, and controlling, each requiring its unique blend of decision-making, people management, and resource allocation. Despite this overwhelming intricacy, a consistent pattern seems to emerge: these management functions can be viewed as processes - sequences of tasks carried out by a manager. In this context, in which both the organization with its environment and the tasks of management functions are transformed into sequences of numerical tensors (as the input and output of an ML model, respectively), the sequence-to-sequence models [31] (and autoregressive models in particular) present a powerful opportunity. These models, known for their ability to make predictions based on past data, can be pivotal in predicting future trends, behaviors or events. Temporal dependence is a natural part of most managerial scenarios, in which the managerial agent needs to predict future events based on the past ones - like sales forecasting, inventory management, or understanding customer as well as employee behavior, among others. Notably, it is directly accounted for by autoregressive models which can naturally translate to these managerial scenarios and could potentially predict a sequence of future events (including the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tasks) based on a sequence of past or alternative events (in the case of a simulation of different scenarios). In the case of autoregressive models (and sequence-to-sequence models in general), the whole domain model (input and output data) must be transformed into time-series data. This involves restructuring the data into a sequential order of instances, with each instance capturing the state of the system at a specific point in time as depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2. The transformation of a domain model (1) to an ML model (2), and then an autoregressive (sequence-to-sequence) ML model (3).

An organization and its environment in organizational studies 5.1. Background Numerous studies in management literature have investigated various aspects of organizations that managers strive to cope with in their pursuit for the common objective - maximizing value by maximizing revenue and minimizing costs, including environmental and societal. A cornerstone to all subsequent managerial models, Taylor's model of scientific management [32], aimed to maximize productivity through the systematic analysis, measurement, and planning of work processes, advocating for the application of scientific methods over traditional 'rule of thumb' approaches, with emphasis on time studies, motion studies, job specialization, and fostering cooperative relationships between workers and managers. Porter [33] analyzed the competitive forces shaping industries and proposed strategies for organizations to gain a competitive advantage. Mintzberg [34] developed a classification of organizational structures based on different configurations of coordination mechanisms. Schein [35] studied organizational culture and its impact on employees' behavior and the overall effectiveness of the organization. Noticeably, the models tend to focus on a single (or a small group) of organizational elements. It is crucial to consider the interplay between various levels of organizational analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of organizational dynamics [36]. These levels, namely micro-, meso-, and macro-levels, serve as distinct (although they are known to be interrelated in multiple areas) lenses through which researchers and practitioners can examine organizational behavior and processes. The micro-level focuses on individual behaviors, attitudes, and interactions, emphasizing the role of employees, managers, and leaders in shaping organizational performance [37]. The meso-level, on the other hand, examines groups, teams, and departments within organizations, delving into group dynamics, organizational culture, and interdepartmental coordination [38]. Finally, the macro-level investigates the organization as a whole, encompassing its structure, strategy, and overall performance, as well as the impact of external factors such as political, economic, social, and technological forces [39]. A robust analysis of organizational functioning requires a nuanced understanding of these levels and their interactions, as events and decisions at one level can significantly influence the others [36]. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of integrating multiple levels of analysis in organizational research [38]. A comprehensive model that combines micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of analysis has been proposed in the extant management literature, emphasizing the interdependence of these levels and their dynamic interaction within organizations. This multilevel framework has been instrumental in shedding light on the complex relationships among individual, team, and organizational factors that drive organizational performance and adaptability. Additionally, this model has led to a more nuanced understanding of the role of context in shaping organizational behavior, challenging traditional linear perspectives and paving the way for a new generation of research that embraces the intricacies of organizational phenomena. Despite the advances in multilevel research and the development of models integrating micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of analysis, there remains a scarcity of studies that comprehensively combine all levels of analysis and encompass all types of elements, such as people, tangible and intangible resources, relations, etc. Bertalanffy's General System Theory [40], on the other hand, laid the foundation for a unifying framework to study the organization and behavior of systems across different disciplines. Bertalanffy recognized that systems, whether they are physical, biological, or social, share common properties and can be analyzed using similar principles. The General System Theory aimed to provide a holistic approach to understanding the organization and interdependence of system components, both internal and external, drawing from the functional-systemic perspective [41]. While Bertalanffy acknowledged that systems, including physical, biological, or social, possess shared characteristics and can be assessed through similar principles, the General System Theory primarily aimed to offer a holistic approach to understanding the organization and interdependence of system components, rather than proposing a specific numerical model for an organization and its environment that encompasses all elements such as people, tangible and intangible resources, relations, etc. Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4795\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4804 4801 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa, Grzegorz Krzos / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 7 5.2. Organizational networks Models of organizational networks come closest to providing a numerical representation of an organization that includes both the organization's internals and its environment and can be presented in a mathematical form. The network paradigm is an interdisciplinary approach that focuses on complex, interdependent relationships among various entities, such as stakeholders, suppliers, and customers [42]. Researchers have recognized the importance of such relationships manifesting in resource sharing, knowledge exchange, strategic alliances, etc., both internal (within an organization) and external (with actors from outside of the organization), which are known to have a significant impact on the organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance and are the foundation of network models. Borgatti and Halgin [43] explored the concept of organizational networks and presented a comprehensive framework for analyzing and interpreting these networks. The authors, employing the meso-level of analysis, argued that organizations can be viewed as networks comprising nodes (individuals, teams, or departments) and ties (relationships, interactions, or flows) between these nodes. They developed a mathematical model based on graph theory to study the structure and behavior of organizational networks, focusing on social ties rather than multimodal connections. Key features of their model include nodes representing actors and ties representing relationships; the differentiation of events and states to describe relationships; various centrality measures to evaluate node importance; network density as an indicator of interconnectivity; and path length analysis to gain insight into network structure and navigability. This model enables researchers to quantitatively study organizational networks by examining social ties and their impact on network structure, behavior, and performance, while not accounting for multimodal connections that may also be present in such networks. 6. Research gap There is a notable research gap in the existing management literature when it comes to developing a generalized (i.e., without assumed dependencies between its elements), numerical (i.e., with each element in a numerical form) model that encompasses an organization and its environment, and includes people, tangible and intangible resources, relations, etc., that change in time. Such a model is believed to enable the application of ML techniques (which are known to excel at finding dependencies between numerical elements) to solve complex organizational problems of the key management functions and optimize aspects of organizational management in a holistic manner by considering the dynamic interactions between elements of the organization and elements of its environment. While organizational network models represent a promising approach for capturing the complex dynamics of organizations and their environment, no article describing a generalized, numerical model that incorporates multimodal elements was found during the review. Development of such a generalized, numerical model of an organization and its environment is believed to pose significant challenges, including: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Representation of people: Modeling individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 characteristics, such as skills, experience, and motivation, in numerical form, as well as capturing the interactions between the individuals and their impact on organizational performance. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Representation of resources: Quantifying the organization's tangible and intangible resources, such as financial capital, technology, or knowledge, and modelling their allocation and utilization within the organization. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Representation of relations: Translating interpersonal, interorganizational, person-organization, resource- resource, person-resource, and any other abstract form of a relationship into numerical terms. This implies devising metrics that encapsulate the nature and strength of these relationships, which may include aspects such as communication, collaboration, conflict, influence, trust, formal and informal connections within the organization and between different resources, etc. Furthermore, the model would need to account for changes in 4802 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4795\u00e2\u20ac\u201c48048 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa, Grzegorz Krzos / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 these relationships over time and the effect they have on the overall performance and strategic outcomes of the organization. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Integration of organizational dimensions: Combining different dimensions of the organization, such as structure, culture, and strategy, as well as different perspectives such as intra-organizational and inter-organizational, into a unified numerical model that reflects the complex interdependencies and dynamics of organizational systems. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Modelling of temporal dependencies: Capturing temporal dependencies among numerous variables. This involves tracking the evolution of elements like employee performance, resource allocation, and organizational dimensions, which are influenced by both current and historical states. The model should account for delay effects, feedback loops, and non-linear time dependencies, making it a complex task to accurately predict future states based on past and present data. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Presentation: Providing an easily accessible and understandable interface for a user (i.e., a management practitioner) to the knowledge about the organization and its environment synthesized by the model, so the user can draw valuable and actionable conclusions. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Ensuring robustness and reliability: Creating a model that is robust and reliable over time and under a range of conditions, considering the inherent uncertainty and changeability in organizations and their environments. This challenge involves validating the model using real-world data and ensuring it is flexible enough to accommodate changes in the organization and its environment. 7. Discussion In this paper, we have critically reviewed the management literature to identify the key management functions managers of organizations deal with in managerial processes, the requirements for a model to be applicable in ML pipelines, and finally reveal a research gap concerning the development of a generalized, numerical model encompassing both an organization and its environment. The findings of the review highlighted the scarcity of generalized, numerical models of an organization and its environment. The objective for the novel model is to be applied in a ML pipeline to solve complex managerial problems, and effectively support managers in the key management functions by enhancing decision-making processes, reducing costs (which include environmental and societal), and improving overall organizational performance and sustainability. While there has been significant progress in modelling various dimensions of organizations, most studies have primarily focused on non-numerical models, or considered only selected aspects of the observed socio-economic reality, without an attempt to generalize the models. A promising approach is the model of organizational networks, which can potentially serve as the foundation for the generalized, numerical model of an organization and its environment. Organizational networks capture the complex interactions and relationships between different actors within and outside the organization, providing a comprehensive view of the organization's structure and dynamics. Notably, the network models are rooted in mathematical concepts, like graph theory, which makes them easier to translate into a purely numerical form, understandable by ML algorithms. Future research aiming to build AI-supported managerial processes (i.e., with ML techniques) should focus on developing novel methodologies for representing organizations and their environments numerically, flexible enough to be able to accommodate various dimensions and complexities of organizational systems, identified on the course of managerial processes. The authors hope that such AI-supported management will have an increasing impact on sustainable business operations and the AI-supported sustainable management will become a tool creating a global competitive advantage of modern economies while minimizing negative environmental and societal effects. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this review. One major limitation is the number of articles reviewed. The scope of the review was restricted, and a more comprehensive review of the literature might yield additional insights and reveal further research gaps. Future research should consider conducting a systematic review or meta-analysis to provide a more extensive and in-depth understanding of the existing literature on Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4795\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4804 4803 Piotr \u00c5\u0161liwa, Grzegorz Krzos / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 9 numerical models of organizations and their environments. Another important limitation is inherent to the supposition laying in the foundation of this research, that ML techniques can indeed automate tasks in the management functions and therefore make the process more efficient. While the abundance of applications supports the notion, it is still plausible that ML cannot solve this class of problems. Notably, ML techniques often struggle with problems that involve high degrees of human intuition, interaction, creativity, and subjective decision-making, which are all integral parts of the management functions. It could be suggested that a blend of ML techniques with more traditional, human-driven approaches might serve better in overcoming the challenges associated with management of an organization.

Komandorska 118-120, 53-345 Wroclaw, Poland Undoubtedly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going mainstream. More and more AI agents come into existence to augment human agents in their work by synthesizing a gigantic body of knowledge in a conversational interface (e.g., ChatGPT), generating art from a provided description (e.g., Stable Diffusion), creating software code based on a provided description (e.g., Codex), just to name a few. It becomes evident that at some point an AI agent will similarly help human managers in their daily operations, and, when it reaches the level of artificial general intelligence (AGI), unlock completely new levels of performance and sustainability. The authors used the critical review method and identified a research gap concerning the development of a generalized, numerical model of an organization and its environment that could be applied in machine learning pipelines, and effectively support managers in the key management functions.

This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies on unemployment in the G7 countries using a dynamic panel estimation approach. The analysis covers the period from 2005 to 2020 and incorporates various control variables related to unemployment rates, along with AI, big data, data science, and machine learning Google Trend Index (GTI). The Arellano\u2013Bover/Blundell\u2013Bond (1998) system estimator is employed to ensure robust results, particularly in cases involving multiple lags of the dependent variable. The most noteworthy results highlight a negative association between AI, big data technologies, and unemployment. These technologies enhance productivity, leading to increased capital accumulation and the creation of new jobs. This validates the \"displacement effect\" for AI and big data technologies, implying that while certain jobs may be automated, the net effect is job creation. Consequently, implementing AI and big data technologies in economic processes can effectively reduce unemployment rates and boost wages by creating new job opportunities. Keywords Artificial intelligence Big data Unemployment rate Dynamic panel data model JEL Code F22 C23 O17 Introduction In recent decades, the rapid development and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation have sparked profound inspiration and significant transformations across various industries. These advancements have revolutionized sectors such as medical diagnoses, autonomous transportation, and advanced manufacturing. According to Francis Gurry's observations, AI represents a new digital frontier that will fundamentally reshape our way of life and work [1]. Moore's [2] law, associated with the decreasing size and increasing power of computers, arises from the observation that the processing power of a chip doubles roughly every two years because the shrinking size of transistors allows them to populate the chip more densely. Moore's law is, however, not without its dark side. For example, as we have moved from generation to generation, the power consumed by each transistor has not fallen in direct proportion to its size, so both the total power consumed by each chip and the power density have been increasing rapidly. A few years ago, it became vogue to observe, given current trends, that in a few generations the temperature on a chip would be hotter than that on the surface of the sun. Thus, over the last few years, in addition to their concerns about improving performance, architects have had to deal with using and managing power effectively [3]. However, the transformative impact of AI extends well beyond the realm of computer hardware. Big data technologies, machine learning, computer vision, neural networks, and other innovations have simplified everyday tasks and even influenced human behavior patterns. As a result, AI has empowered cognitive machines and modern information technologies, leading to a powerful transformation in both personal and professional domains. While AI has the potential to enhance productivity in numerous industries, it also raises concerns about the displacement of human labor and the revolutionizing of occupations. The emergence of groundbreaking technological innovations has been a topic of consistent engagement for economists and policymakers. The effects of artificial intelligence on the economy, particularly in relation to unemployment, are widely discussed. It is anticipated that the economic impact of artificial intelligence may vary across different regions, influenced by the specific economic activities and technological readiness of each region. There are two main streams of opinion regarding the effects of artificial intelligence on unemployment. The first perspective, known as the \"replacement effect,\" optimistically asserts that AI lowers the unemployment rate by enhancing complementarity between human and intellectual capabilities. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that AI is a new technology that fosters productivity, reduces labor requirements, and drives economic expansion, thereby generating employment opportunities in other sectors. In contrast, the opposing viewpoint emphasizes the \"displacement effect\" and predicts a rise in unemployment. According to this perspective, although new jobs may be created in the modern age, they are primarily performed by robots, \"brilliant machines,\" or cognitive systems, potentially leading to a jobless economy [4,5]. In the existing literature, researchers have primarily relied on descriptive and comparative analyses to explore the connection between AI and unemployment. However, a comprehensive econometric model to determine this relationship has yet to be suggested. One of the main obstacles is the lack of systematic data to accurately measure the utilization of AI and big data technologies. Consequently, researchers have turned to alternative data sources such as Google Trends data to enhance unemployment modeling. The Google Trends Index (GTI) monitors patterns of words or phrases entered the Google search engine. Previous attempts to incorporate GTIs into predictive models have shown promising results [6\u20138]. Taking this perspective into account, the present study aims to employ GTIs associated with AI in G7 countries to establish the relationship between AI, big data technologies, and the unemployment rate. Firstly, this study proposes a comprehensive analysis that focuses specifically on G7 countries, distinguishing itself from previous studies. Secondly, it pioneers the utilization of a dynamic panel data estimation method to examine the impact of artificial intelligence on unemployment. By employing this innovative approach, the study seeks to provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics between AI, big data technologies, and unemployment, shedding light on the potential consequences for the labor market. Literature review In recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the literature concerning the impact of AI on unemployment [9,10\u201312]. Many contributions in this area consider AI as a component of a broader automation process [13]. Broadly speaking, the literature can be categorized into two main approaches: those supporting a 'replacement effect' of jobs by AI and those supporting a 'displacement effect'. The first part of the literature validates the 'replacement effect' and highlights various aspects of this phenomenon. According to these studies, the application of AI has a negative impact on the labor market, leading to unemployment as a result of job replacement. Early academic works exploring the negative impact of AI on employment can be traced back to Leontief [14], who predicted that AI would replace almost the entire workforce in the coming decades, resulting in widespread unemployment. Ngo et al. [15] found that 48 % of technology specialists believe that robots could perform the most standardized and automated tasks. Consequently, in the era of AI, traditional jobs, except for those requiring highly specialized skills, are at risk of unemployment. Susskind and Susskind [16] argue that high-tech unemployment will further increase in the age of artificial intelligence, with traditional industries being gradually replaced by routine tasks performed by technology. Frey and Osborne [17] developed a model that revealed 47 % of more than 700 occupations are susceptible to being replaced within the next two decades. David [18] pointed out that the jobs at high risk of substitution by AI, irrespective of gender differences, account for as much as 55 %. Graetz and Michaels [19] found that robots have had a greater impact on reducing responsibilities for low-skilled workers compared to medium-skilled and high-skilled workers. Furthermore, studies by Felten et al. [20] and Fossen and Sorgner [21] showed a positive association between high computerization risk and the likelihood of occupation change or unemployment. Chang-jun et al. [22] suggest that universities play a crucial role in enhancing professional skills and cultivating desirable personality traits that can help graduates reduce the risk of being replaced by AI. Georgieff and Milanez [23] examined whether occupations identified as having a high risk of automation in 2012 experienced a net loss of workers seven years later. They found that these occupations displayed weaker employment growth compared to other jobs, and in some cases, even experienced a modest decline in employment levels. Ma et al. [24] demonstrated that the development of AI significantly affects the skill structure of employment, and regional innovation plays a significant mediating role. They observed that with increased innovation, industrial upgrading, and technological progress, the influence of AI on middle-skill employment gradually weakens, while high-skilled employment exhibits a U-shaped change under the influence of an innovative environment and technological progress. The second part of the literature presents the \"displacement effect,\" suggesting that AI has a positive impact on the labor market, leading to a decrease in unemployment. Scholars argue that while artificial intelligence may have a short-term impact on the job market, the substantial increase in production efficiency will ultimately result in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in the long term. Nobel Prize-winning economist Boden [25] asserts that AI development is replicable and predicts that, despite transitional challenges, there will be a considerable increase in job creation\u2014albeit in different forms\u2014eliminating long-term concerns about unemployment. Supporting this theory, the McKinsey Global Institute Research [26] predicts a demand for 250,000 data scientists by 2024. Additional studies provide further evidence for the displacement effect. Dauth et al. [27] examine the effects of robot adoption on the German labor market and find that it redistributes jobs across industries without decreasing overall employment levels. Gries and Naud\u00e9 [28] integrate artificial intelligence into an economic growth model, incorporating limitations on total demand. Their findings suggest that AI does not directly lead to increased unemployment. Acemoglu and Restrepo [29] investigate the relationship between AI, automation, and work, highlighting the improvement in productivity driven by AI and automation, which is further supported by increased capital accumulation. This, in turn, leads to the technical advancement of existing work with more skilled workers, creating new jobs. Webb [30] observes a decline in employment and wages for jobs highly exposed to automation technologies, while Aghion et al. [31], using French data, find a positive impact of automation on employment at the firm and industry levels. Koch et al. [32] analyze a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms and report a net increase of 10 % in jobs due to robot adoption, while firms that did not invest in robots experienced job losses over the same period. However, it is important to note that at the aggregate level, automation does not lead to net job destruction. Felten et al. [33] propose an \"AI Occupational Impact\" measure and find that while artificial intelligence has a small positive effect on wages, it does not significantly impact employment. Acemoglu et al. [34] analyze data on online vacancies and find no correlation between AI exposure and employment or wages. Despite the various aspects in which artificial intelligence and unemployment are discussed in the literature, empirical studies remain limited. Therefore, this study aims to address three critical research gaps. Firstly, there is a lack of empirical papers that focus on examining the relationship between artificial intelligence, big data technologies, and unemployment. While previous research has explored the futuristic aspects of AI, this study takes a step further by developing an empirical econometric model. Secondly, there is a shortage of systematic and big datasets on AI usage for investigating the relationship between AI and unemployment. Therefore, this study utilizes a comprehensive yearly dataset covering the period from 2005 to 2020, encompassing panel data from G7 countries. The dataset related to unemployment and the control variables used was obtained from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and OECD database, as well as the GTIs dataset was sourced from Google Trend to acquire a comprehensive and systematic dataset. Methodology and empirical model Research variables and dataset This section examines the model variables that focus on the impact of artificial intelligence and big data technologies on unemployment in the G7 countries. The response variable, representing the unemployment rate as a percentage of the total labor force, signifies individuals who are unemployed but actively seeking employment. To isolate the effects of the main variable of interest, a set of control variables is evaluated. Theoretical models and existing literature suggest that variables such as inflation rate, population growth, government size, and foreign direct investment (FDI) are essential control variables. The inflation rate reflects the annual percentage change in the economy's overall price level, as measured by the consumer price index. The theoretical literature indicates a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment [35]. The Phillips curve theory establishes a stable relationship between inflation and unemployment dynamics, stating that inflationary growth leads to increased job creation and reduced unemployment [36]. The total population within the age range of 15 to 64 represents individuals with full legal status or citizenship and serves as a midyear estimate. Population growth can positively affect employment by stimulating consumer demand, driving economic activity, and creating new job opportunities. Moreover, a larger labor force can contribute to productivity gains, innovation, and entrepreneurship, fostering economic growth and reducing unemployment rates. The relationship between population growth and unemployment is influenced by various factors, including overall economic conditions, labor market policies, education and training systems, technological advancements, and government interventions. Effectively managing unemployment in the context of population growth requires a comprehensive approach that addresses both the demand side (creating sufficient job opportunities) and the supply side (equipping individuals with the necessary skills and qualifications). Government size, expressed as a percentage of GDP, refers to cash payments for operating activities in the provision of goods and services. Fiscal actions can influence labor supply and unemployment, even with output growth. Alternatively, if reductions in government purchases lead to increased private-sector output and higher productivity, GDP can still grow despite an increase in unemployment. Recent research reflects this ambiguity: While Monacelli et al. [37], Auerbach and Gorodnichenko [38], Ramey [39], Holden and Sparrman [40] conclude that an increase in government purchases leads to lower unemployment, a string of empirical studies indicates that enormous government spending will likely increase unemployment. Abrams [41], Christopoulos et al. [42], Feldmann [43], Br\u00fcckner and Pappa [44] find that increased government purchases lead to higher unemployment. Labor productivity, measured as output per worker and comprising GDP and the total employed population, does not exhibit a particularly noticeable relationship with unemployment. Basu et al. [45], for instance, emphasize the negative impact of productivity on unemployment resulting from technological shocks. In contrast, Gallegati et al. [46], using a pure wavelet method, suggest a positive effect, but only in the long run. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) refers to net inflows of funds used to acquire a long-term managerial stake in a company operating in a country other than that of the investors. The literature indicates that FDI inflows generate additional jobs [47,48]. Therefore, an inverse relationship between FDI and unemployment is expected. The main variable of interest captures the volume of the GTIs related to AI and big data technologies. The four most popular search terms considered for big data and artificial intelligence are: \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d, \u201cBig Data\u201d, \u201cData Science\u201d, and \u201cMachine Learning\u201d, respectively. Four different scenarios were estimated due to the high correlation among these search terms. Consequently, the variables, variable description, data source and predicted signs of variable are described in Table 1 based on both the empirical model and the literature. Econometric method and empirical model This section decides the econometric method and empirical model for the variables we examine. Because unemployment rates are always influenced by historical values, dynamic panel models are more appropriate. Dynamic panel-data models include p lags of the dependent variable as covariates and contain unobserved panel-level effects, fixed or random. By construction, the unobserved panel-level effects are correlated with the lagged dependent variables, making standard estimators inconsistent [49]. Arellano and Bond [50] derived a consistent generalized moments (GMM) estimator method for this model. The Arellano and Bond estimator can perform poorly if the autoregressive parameters are too large or the ratio of the variance of the panel-level effect to the variance of the idiosyncratic error is too large. Building on the work of Arellano and Bover [51], Blundell and Bond [52] developed a system estimator that uses additional moment conditions; y i t = \u2211 j = 1 p \u03b1 j y i , t \u2212 j + x i t \u03b2 1 + w i t \u03b2 2 + \u03bd i + \u03f5 i t i = 1 , \u2026 , N t = 1 , \u2026 , T i where the \u03b1 j are p parameters to be estimated, x i t is a 1 \u00d7 k 1 vector of strictly exogenous covariates, \u03b2 1 is a k 1 \u00d7 1 vector of parameters to be estimated, w i t is a 1 \u00d7 k 2 vector of predetermined or endogenous covariates, \u03b2 2 is a k 2 \u00d7 1 vector of parameters to be estimated, \u03bd i are the panel-level effects (which may be correlated with the covariates), and \u03f5 i t are i.i.d. over the whole sample with variance \u03c3 \u03f5 2 . The \u03bd i and the \u03f5 i t are assumed to be independent for each i overall t . This estimator is designed for datasets with many panels and few periods. This method assumes no autocorrelation in the idiosyncratic errors. It requires the initial condition that the panel-level effects be uncorrelated with the first difference of the first observation of the dependent variable. Blundell and Bond [52] indicate that the lagged-level instruments in the Arellano\u2013Bond estimator come to be weak as the autoregressive process turn into too persistent or the ratio of the panel-level effects \u03bdi to the variance of the idiosyncratic error \u03f5 i t grow to be too larger. Construction on the study of Arellano and Bover [51], Blundell and Bond [52] suggested a system estimator that application moment conditions in which lagged differences are used as instruments for the level equation and the moment conditions of lagged levels as instruments for the differenced equation. The additional moment conditions are acceptable only if the initial condition E[\u03bdi\u2206yi2] = 0 holds for all i . The empirical model we propose builds upon existing literature but incorporates some modifications. Inspired by the methods employed by Dornbusch et al. [53], we combine the Phillips curve [35] and Okun's law [54]. However, unlike previous studies, our approach incorporates artificial intelligence and big data technologies as controlling factors for unemployment. Hence, our model can be represented as shown in Eq. (1). (1) U N i , t = \u03b1 0 + \u03b2 1 U N i , t \u2212 1 + \u03b2 2 U N i , t \u2212 2 + \u03b2 3 I R i , t + \u03b2 4 P G i , t + \u03b2 5 L P i , t + \u03b2 6 G S i , t + \u03b2 7 F D I i , t + \u03b2 8 G T I i , t + \u03b5 i , t Where UN is unemployment rate, IR (Inflation rate), PG (Population Growth), GS (Government Size), LP(Labor Productivity), FDI (Foreign Direct Investment), and the GTI is Google Trend Index that this variable takes on different values for every search term in different scenarios. While, countries denote (i), time denotes (t), constant (\u03b10), coefficients (\u03b21 to \u03b26) and error term (\u03b5i,t). Empirical findings Descriptive analysis The empirical study utilizes a panel dataset consisting of G7 member countries from 2005 to 2020. The timeframe of the study corresponds to the years when the global interest in artificial intelligence and big data searches experienced a notable increase. The selected countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This choice is motivated by two key factors: firstly, these nations possess advanced technology and complex economies, and secondly, they ranked highly in the Global Innovation 2019 rankings, indicating significant innovation performance. Firstly, we start to investigate the global trends in job creation associated with Data Science, Machine Learning, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence in this study. Fig. 1 illustrates the global trendline for these technologies from 2005 to 2020. Based on the calculations of GTIs in Fig. 1, it is observed that the search term \u201cMachine Learning\u201d has garnered the highest level of global attention, and it has been receiving more searches compared to \u201cData Science\u201d and \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d since 2014. Although the search term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d experienced a decline until 2014, it regained popularity after mid-2016. Conversely, the search terms \u201cData Science\u201d, \u201cMachine Learning\u201d and \u201cBig Data\u201d did not receive significant attention until 2012 but started to gain traction afterward. Table 2 displays the correlation matrix, which highlights the relationships between these search terms. In Table 2, calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients indicate data science has a stronger positive correlation with machine learning ( \u03c1 =0.980) and AI ( \u03c1 =0.815); however, it has a moderate positive correlation with big data ( \u03c1 =0.697). Furthermore, machine learning Services have a stronger positive correlation with big data ( \u03c1 =0.731) and AI ( \u03c1 =0.844). In addition, big data has a moderate positive correlation with AI ( \u03c1 =0.448). Many economic, science, and technology development and rising trends in the world are directed by the G7 countries. As a result, it would be interesting to see in Fig. 2 which of these search terms the G7 countries use the most. Machine learning is a more popular search topic in Japan and Germany, as shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, in France, big data is a popular search topic, and AI searches in Google are similar level in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Empirical results In this section, we estimate the econometric model in Eq. (1). The F-test for fixed effects confirms the presence of fixed effects across all scenarios in Table 3 . Hence, disregarding fixed effects is not justified. To account for these fixed effects, we can incorporate them as dummy variables or employ a first-difference approach using dynamic panel GMM estimators. All scenarios presented in Table 3 consider the unemployment process with a consideration of past unemployment levels, reflecting a form of \"memory.\" The Sargan [55] test and the p-values for the Arellano-Bond [56] test for AR(2) demonstrate that the instruments used in the models are well identified, and the residuals do not exhibit autocorrelation. Consequently, all the models exhibit robustness when utilizing estimation methods like the Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond [51,52] GMM-system estimator. The results of the Pesaran [57,58] CD cross-sectional dependence test indicate the absence of cross-sectional dependence across all scenarios. In the estimation process, robust standard errors are employed to account for heteroscedasticity, and the variables included in the model exhibit statistical significance, at least at the 5 % level. Table 3 also reveals that the process of adjusting unemployment is still inflexible, as current unemployment shows both positive and negative associations with previous unemployment. Government size and population growth have a positive impact on unemployment across all scenarios, while inflation, labor productivity, and FDI exhibit negative effects. The main findings highlight a significant negative correlation between artificial intelligence, big data technologies, and unemployment. In Scenario 1, an increase in the search volume (GTI) related to artificial intelligence in G7 countries leads to a reduction in the unemployment rate by 0.011 percent. Similarly, in Scenario 2, an increase in the search volume related to big data results in a decrease in the unemployment rate by 0.007 percent. Additionally, increased search volumes for data science (Scenario 3) and machine learning (Scenario 4) separately contribute to a reduction in the unemployment rate by 0.005 percent. Consequently, all scenarios confirm the existence of the \"displacement effect.\" These new technologies, such as AI and big data, do not contribute to increased unemployment. On the contrary, they generate new job opportunities and decrease unemployment. Conclusion This study analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence and big data technologies on unemployment in the G7 countries. It utilizes an empirical model based on dynamic panel data estimations. The dataset covers the period from 2005 to 2020 and includes control variables related to the unemployment rate, as well as key variables such as AI, big data, data science, and the machine learning Google Trend Index (GTI). The study examines the relationship between artificial intelligence, big data technologies, and unemployment across four scenarios, each associated with specific GTIs. The Arellano\u2013Bover/Blundell\u2013Bond [51,52] system estimator is employed to test all scenarios, providing robust results, especially when multiple lags of the dependent variable are incorporated. Diagnostic tests confirm the validity of the econometric model, and all variables within the model are found to be statistically significant. The findings reveal consistency with economic theories, with inflation findings aligning with Phillips [35] and labor productivity results corresponding to Basu et al. [45]. Each scenarios validates the Phillips effect, which relates to the relationship between inflation and unemployment. In addition, all scenarios underscore the importance of labor productivity. Additionally, the study highlights two critical determinants, the government size and foreign direct investment, which are strongly recommended in the literature as controls in the dynamic panel data model for our scenarios. Across all cases, government size and foreign direct investment are both significant and negatively correlated with unemployment, findings supported by Feldmann [43], Craigwell [47], and Karlsson et al. [48]. Specifically, expanding the public sector in the economies under discussion absorbs unemployment, with net FDI inflows supporting this process. The most significant findings indicate a negative relationship between artificial intelligence, big data technologies, and unemployment. AI and big data technologies enhance productivity, which is further bolstered by increased capital accumulation. The infusion of a larger labor force into current businesses results in technological improvements and the creation of new jobs, validating the 'displacement effect' for AI and big data technologies. The impact of AI on employment has been a subject of extensive debate and concern. While AI has indeed led to automation and the displacement of certain jobs, its overall impact on employment is more nuanced. AI technologies have the potential to generate new job opportunities, particularly in the development and maintenance of AI systems and related technologies. Moreover, AI can augment human capabilities and enhance productivity, leading to the creation of new roles and the reassignment of tasks. However, there is a need for workforce retraining and upskilling to adapt to the evolving job landscape. To ensure a seamless transition and minimize adverse consequences, proactive measures such as investing in education and training programs, fostering entrepreneurship, and promoting the responsible use of AI in the labor market are crucial. In addition, striking a balance between harnessing the benefits of AI for productivity and economic growth while addressing potential job displacement and ensuring the workforce is equipped with the skills needed for the AI-driven economy of the future is essential. As a result, G7 and other high-tech countries can effectively leverage artificial intelligence and big data technologies in economic processes to reduce unemployment. Consequently, with new job opportunities created through innovative technology, it could become possible to manage unemployment rates and wages effectively.

To align with the WHO World Report on Vision recommendations to integrate eye health as part of universal health coverage, eye health services must be prioritised in national health policy planning and budgeting. 1,8,10 In addition to national organisations, public-private partnerships with for-profit and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can play a pivotal role in funding progress. 115 In partnership with the government and the Brien Holden Vision Institute, Pakistan&apos;s largest NGO, the Pakistan Layton Rahmatulla Benevolent Trust Hospital, supported optical stores within secondary and tertiary hospitals, to increase patient uptake of prescribed spectacles. 114,116 In Tanzania, a sevenfold increase in patients receiving eye care was achieved thanks to funding from government and NGOs such as Helen Keller International and ORBIS International. 117 The inaugural Toolkit for Glaucoma Management\u2014a practical guide to support integrated glaucoma care services and strengthen sustainable health systems\u2014was developed by sub-Saharan African ophthalmologists, with the support of international organisations including the IAPB and funding from NGOs, Light For The World, and the Else Kr\u00f6ner-Fresenius-Stiftung. 118 item S2214-109X(23)00323-6 S2214109X23003236 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00323-6 286970 2023-09-19T20:03:33.187949Z 2023-09-01 2023-09-30 UNLIMITED NONE 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-main.pdf https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/MAIN/application/pdf/05364b8cbb13f37a5291db087bfb62cb/main.pdf main.pdf pdf true 670550 MAIN 12 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-main_1.png https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/PREVIEW/image/png/fe9ec2635e8e34facf0efbe37a753f18/main_1.png main_1.png png 104459 849 656 IMAGE-WEB-PDF 1 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr1.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/gr1/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/254b558834b9b5656cedfbe5ff09632b/gr1.jpg gr1 gr1.jpg jpg 120434 590 942 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr2.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/gr2/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/c10102edf87504422502027cbd16da97/gr2.jpg gr2 gr2.jpg jpg 112209 411 941 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr3.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/gr3/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/4ece96316a196f0ed676d364f6be9ea3/gr3.jpg gr3 gr3.jpg jpg 53599 480 446 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr1.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/gr1/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/b3a71bce9ead543fa43cf9b5c357cc92/gr1.sml gr1 gr1.sml sml 8165 137 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr2.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/gr2/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/5dc27cf4d1369d807e63c42c9e4737e9/gr2.sml gr2 gr2.sml sml 9023 96 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr3.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/gr3/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/844aa75f35c6c10f36d3ad960908d3e4/gr3.sml gr3 gr3.sml sml 7540 164 152 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr1_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/f22866c9eefff0bdaa15a74538bffc37/gr1_lrg.jpg gr1 gr1_lrg.jpg jpg 989122 2612 4172 IMAGE-HIGH-RES 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr2_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/27ebad86e746de222b68a90f8f633596/gr2_lrg.jpg gr2 gr2_lrg.jpg jpg 960933 1817 4165 IMAGE-HIGH-RES 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-gr3_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2214109X23003236/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/3418ed47b05467cea98844fe0b0637bf/gr3_lrg.jpg gr3 gr3_lrg.jpg jpg 441484 2127 1977 IMAGE-HIGH-RES 1-s2.0-S2214109X23003236-am.pdf https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/egi:10JVPXFW0PH/MAIN/application/pdf/e7aa14b8a66a6b0e8adf9e38e674d1f3/am.pdf am am.pdf pdf false 943265 AAM-PDF LANGLO 2920 S2214-109X(23)00323-6 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00323-6 The Author(s).

Improving eye health is a global priority as a key to unlocking human potential by reducing the morbidity burden of disease, increasing productivity, and supporting access to education. Although extraordinary progress fuelled by global eye health initiatives has been made over the last decade, there remain substantial challenges impeding further progress. The accelerated development of digital health and artificial intelligence (AI) applications provides an opportunity to transform eye health, from facilitating and increasing access to eye care to supporting clinical decision making with an objective, data-driven approach. Here, we explore the opportunities and challenges presented by digital health and AI in global eye health and describe how these technologies could be leveraged to improve global eye health. AI, telehealth, and emerging technologies have great potential, but require specific work to overcome barriers to implementation. We suggest that a global digital eye health task force could facilitate coordination of funding, infrastructural development, and democratisation of AI and digital health to drive progress forwards in this domain. Introduction Global eye health is defined by The Lancet Global Health Commission as the degree to which vision, ocular health, and function are maximised worldwide, thereby optimising overall wellbeing and quality of life. 1 In addition to being a substantial source of morbidity around the world, vision impairment also has an important influence on economic productivity, with an estimated global productivity loss from visual impairment amounting to US$410\u00b77 billion in 2020. 2 Improvements in eye health also support access to quality education, empowering more individuals to seek employment, and in turn reducing inequalities. 1,3 However, worldwide, over 2\u00b72 billion people have near or distance vision impairment, with half of these cases preventable or treatable. 2 Relative to higher-income countries, rates are estimated to be eight-times higher in low-income countries and four-times higher in middle-income countries. 2,4 Globally, leading causes of visual impairment include uncorrected refractive errors, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Moreover, many more patients rely on continuous eye care services to prevent visual loss or have conditions such as dry eyes or conjunctivitis associated with substantial morbidity despite their sparing of vision. 5 Over the last three decades, global public health initiatives have made considerable progress in eye health, including a substantial reduction in cases of trachoma, vitamin A deficiency, and onchocerciasis (river blindness). 6,7 There has been a reduced age-standardised prevalence of avoidable blindness (\u201315\u00b74% [95% CI \u201316\u00b78 to \u201314\u00b73]), although avoidable moderate and severe vision impairment showed no change over the same period (0\u00b75% [\u20130\u00b78 to 1\u00b76]). 2 However, the absolute number of cases has increased for both avoidable blindness (10\u00b78% [8\u00b79 to 12\u00b74]) and avoidable moderate and severe vision impairment (31\u00b75% [30\u00b70 to 33\u00b71]). Further action is needed. Evolving priorities for global eye health There have been several major global programmes and initiatives to identify the major challenges and provide a roadmap to improve and maintain global eye health. The Lancet Global Health Commission defined grand challenges in global eye health through a prioritisation exercise, to guide action and research. The process involved diverse stakeholders in over 118 countries, representing clinical practice, eye care system management, research, policy making, and patients affected by eye health problems. 8 Key identified global and regional challenges included improving condition-specific treatment approaches, integration of eye health into the broader health system at all levels, improving access and equity to eye care services, and building resource capacity. 8 WHO has adopted similar recommendations. Achieving universal health coverage\u2014ensuring all people can receive the high-quality health services they need, without experiencing financial hardship\u2014is a WHO strategic priority. 9 The WHO World Report on Vision recommends making eye care an integral part of universal health coverage. 10 The adoption of the World Health Assembly Resolution 73.4 in 2020 requires all countries to strengthen eye care within and across their health systems, 11 and two new global targets for eye care have been endorsed: increasing the effective refractive error coverage by 40% and the effective cataract surgical coverage by 30% before 2030. 12 The first UN General Assembly resolution on eye health: Vision for Everyone\u2014Accelerating Action to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was unanimously adopted by all 193 countries of the UN on July 23, 2021. 13 It is the first agreement designed to tackle preventable sight loss adopted by the UN, enshrining eye health as a part of the UN's SDGs. The resolution creates new expectations for international financial institutions and donors to provide targeted finances, especially to support developing countries in tackling preventable sight loss. Additionally, the UN now incorporates eye care in its work. The resolution sets a target for eye care for all by 2030\u2014with all countries providing full access to eye care services for their populations, and making eye care part of nations\u2019 journeys to attain the SDGs. Bringing together these major initiatives, 2030 IN SIGHT is the eye health sector's strategic plan for the next decade. 14 It synthesises recommendations from The Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health, the UN, and WHO to advocate for the elevation of vision as a fundamental economic, social and development issue; integrate eye health in wider health-care systems and activate patient, consumer, and market change; and ultimately to achieve universal health coverage and the UN's SDGs. Embracing technology is one of the ten key working points incorporated into 2030 IN SIGHT, and technological solutions are highlighted by The Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health for their potential to improve delivery and coverage of eye care services. Although extraordinary progress has been made over the last decade, there remain considerable challenges which present an opportunity to improve the lives of billions of people by improving global eye health. In this Review, we specifically explore the opportunities and challenges represented by digital health and artificial intelligence (AI) in global eye health. Potential of AI and digital health in global eye health Digital health is used as a term to describe the multidisciplinary, innovative space encompassing medicine and technology. WHO recommends the assessment of digital health tools on the basis of benefits, harms, acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity considerations. 15 Digital health innovation includes AI, telemedicine, virtual reality, and wireless communication technologies; all potentially integrated into clinical diagnosis, management, and prognosis. The development of digital health and AI applications has accelerated in the last 10 years (figure 1 ), and WHO has emphasised that these new tools could transform eye health, ranging from facilitating and increasing access to eye care to supporting clinical decision making with an objective, data-driven approach. 16,17 AI AI has shown great potential in automating tasks requiring clinical expertise, particularly in ophthalmological diagnosis. Deep learning has emerged since the 2010s as an AI technique facilitating analysis of unstructured data, such as language, images, and video. 18 In ophthalmology, deep learning is most commonly applied to diagnostic medical imaging: principally fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. 19 Algorithms trained with deep learning have shown expert or supra-expert level diagnostic accuracy for diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error, cataract, and anterior segment diseases; and many have been accepted by regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Union Medical Device Regulation. 19\u201321 A plethora of models are available for many conditions, all offering different strengths and limitations such as differential sensitivity, specificity, and computational requirements. Deciding which to use requires careful consideration. 19 Similar techniques have also been used on ophthalmological data in other contexts, such as to gauge the health of anatomically removed systems in oculomics (eg, heart, kidneys), or to identify personal characteristics (eg, sex and ethnicity). 22,23 Natural language processing is another form of AI which also depends on deep learning, and underlies efforts to automate initial clinical encounters, such as with chatbots (eg, ChatGPT, discussed here), interpretation of clinical notes, and data gathering from patient records. 24 In high-income countries, the specific applications of currently available AI technology range from diagnosis, risk assessment, prognosis, oculomics, decision making, and disease screening, to health policy and planning. 25 The deployment of AI systems in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in eye health is not as widely available to date but includes screening for diabetic retinopathy, myopia, and retinopathy of prematurity using fundus photographs. 26\u201329 Although other validated digital health technologies have large potential in LMIC settings, this requires addressing key organisational and financial challenges, discussed here. More generally, AI could facilitate a reorientation of eye health service provision to be centred on primary care. An example of real-life deployment of AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening in primary care settings in Rwanda, a central African LMIC, showed higher adherence to referrals generated by an AI system when compared with conventional grading by a human. 30 AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening facilitated by the Cybersight AI telehealth platform (Orbis International, New York, USA) enabled immediate diabetic retinopathy grading for referral recommendation, and also facilitated same-day ophthalmologist review and immediate eye health counselling (figure 2 ). 30 Another example is Automated Retinal Disease Assessment (ARDA), used to screen over 200 000 patients for diabetic retinopathy in India and Thailand. 31 The ARDA team have described successfully overcoming a range of unexpected challenges which provides a useful roadmap for future projects. 31 Such systems could reduce the burden on stretched specialist clinics, and also improve prompt delivery of patient-centred care. 30,32 These prior examples of successful deployment would benefit LMICs most considerably as they possess the fewest ophthalmologists per capita. 33 Telehealth, virtual reality, and augmented reality Telehealth in ophthalmology describes platforms and mechanisms of delivering care to patients remotely. 34 Although efforts were already underway to increase remote consultations as a proportion of patient interactions, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated implementation of telephone and video. 35,36 The capabilities of telehealth are further increased by innovative means of conducting diagnostic tests and delivering treatment to patients remotely. These means include home-based tests, such as for visual acuity or visual fields, 37,38 which have been deployed successfully within LMICs. 39 Other tests requiring more expensive hardware could also improve coverage of eye care by facilitating examination in remote hubs or within primary care settings\u2014rather than in stretched or inaccessible centralised ophthalmology clinics\u2014with subsequent asynchronous remote-viewing of findings by humans\u2014eg, trained graders or specialist physicians. 40 Patient education is also possible on telephone and video platforms, but certain aspects of management depend on physical contact, and therefore still require face-to-face interaction. 32,41 Telehealth can engage communities by improving their access to health care; its potential is amplified by integrating other emerging technologies to increase functionality, such as with AI and remotely delivered test platforms. 38,42,43 Telehealth can also be enhanced through immersive virtual reality (an entirely simulated environment) and augmented reality (an augmentation of the natural environment with superimposed elements). Both augmented and virtual reality have been used to improve diagnosis, education, and management. 44,45 However, costs are currently prohibitive, and further research is required to establish efficacy and cost-effectiveness. 45 As these extended reality technologies mature, there is potential for disruptive innovation to improve clinical practice and medical education. 46 Costs might impede deployment at scale in LMICs, but smaller investments in this technology could be leveraged in the future to optimise remote training of eye specialists to serve less privileged communities, or to improve the capacity and capability of centralised but peripheral clinics through real-time communication with domestic or international specialist centres. Emerging technologies: 6G, wearables, big data, internet of things, and AI assistants Most digital health solutions depend on wireless, long-distance connectivity: the internet. Existing telemedicine programmes are limited by available internet options in LMICs, particularly cost-effective technologies such as WiFi (IIEE 802.11) and CDMA450 cellular technology, or delay-tolerant networks which transmit information in pulses. 47 Advancements in the internet such as 5th generation telecommunications (5G) use higher frequency millimetre waves than existing networks to provide lower latency, higher capacity, and improved transmission speed. 48,49 However, while more advanced telecommunication technology offers the potential for more advanced digital health applications, the requirement for densely packed, expensive small-cell base stations might continue to exclude populations in rural or lower-income areas. In addition, 6th generation telecommunications (6G) are being developed which might ameliorate the limitations imposed by the computing power of mobile devices. 6G is posited as an enabling technology for intelligent wearable devices, for health monitoring. 50 However, 6G is affected by similar accessibility issues as 5G\u2014these infrastructural challenges in the context of global eye health are elaborated on here. Greater internet connectivity, and prevalence of internet-connected devices, has given rise to the concept of an internet of things. As these devices now outnumber people, and wireless telecommunication technology continues to improve, the notion of devices communicating without human input is both feasible and likely. 51 An intelligent internet of medical things is also feasible as connectivity improves, enabling health care to integrate relevant information from appropriate devices. 50,52 The wealth of information collected through devices\u2019 sensors could be transmitted through internet of things networks to improve efficiency and efficacy of health care. Location data could be leveraged to improve appointment scheduling at a macro level, adjusting appointments as patients arrive early or late, as well as at a micro level, perhaps directing patients to different phases in the ophthalmological consultation based on current availability of visual field machines, acuity charts, and clinicians. 53 Investigation results could be uploaded automatically to electronic health records, integrated with automation to flag concerning features. 53 Broader health data, collected by phones and other wearable technology, could be transmitted to electronic health records too, and management plans could integrate wearable devices to improve monitoring and treatment adherence. 53 As big data are generated and processed at a personal level, cybersecurity is of paramount importance. Emerging blockchain technology could prove useful in this domain, as it facilitates data sharing with costless verification, immutable transaction records, and asymptotic security. 54,55 Blockchain frameworks consist of a growing chain of blocks, linked to their immediate predecessor by a cryptographic hash value. To generate another block in a transaction (eg, to add data to a patient record), a consensus protocol must be fulfilled, with rules defined to ensure changes are verified. 54\u201356 Architectures can be designed to restrict access to appropriate parties only: such as to train or apply AI models from multiple sources of confidential data, maintain electronic patient records, or supply chain monitoring. 29,56 Few clinical applications of blockchain technology have been reported, 56 but a deep-learning algorithm for detecting high myopia and myopic macular degeneration successfully used a blockchain-based platform for securely transmitting data, transferring the deep-learning model, and testing the model in independent Singaporean and Chinese health-care centres. 29 Recently, data available on the internet has been leveraged by natural language processing models such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA)\u2014a large language model (LLM) chatbot platform which uses reinforcement learning from human feedback on top of a pretrained large language model. 57,58 These platforms are being trialled in a wide variety of settings, including to pass medical examinations and provide advice to patients online. 59\u201361 LLMs fine-tuned with clinical data exhibit even greater promise. 62 Patients and practitioners could benefit from rapid, interactive access to medical information with ease and at no personal cost. 62 Accessibility to close to cutting-edge natural language processing could be democratised through imitative models: small open source LLMs can be fine-tuned on answers generated by state-of-the-art parent models to develop daughter models with comparable performance to the parent model, using a fraction of the computational resources, energy, and time to train. 62 However, performance in specialist examinations is lower than at medical student level, suggesting that clinical applications might require domain-specific training. 63 Moreover, the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by these platforms is not validated, and no regulatory structures exist. Patients\u2019 opinions on the trust they would place in an AI chatbot are mixed. 64 Autonomous deployment is precluded by inaccuracy, lack of an uncertainty indicator, and uninterpretability, but further research and development could produce tools capable of improving consultation capacity, patient education, and triage. 63,65 The versatility of these models facilitates rapid assimilation of information from diverse, multimodal sources, which could contribute to eye disease risk prediction and diagnosis using electronic medical record data alongside investigation results. Challenges impeding digital health integration Regulatory barriers to clinical deployment of digital health tools Much work is required to convince governance bodies to accept new digital health tools, as well as for physicians and other health-care professionals to incorporate them into their clinical practice\u2014especially for diagnostic and management innovations. 66 Moreover, autonomous deployment of AI systems presents unique medicolegal issues which are being debated around the world as tools become more sophisticated. 65 There are therefore very few examples of AI algorithms currently used in routine clinical work, despite the plethora of validated models in the literature. 67,68 Inventors and researchers are hampered by an unclear, challenging roadmap to the deployment of novel digital health tools. Validation, safety testing, and multidisciplinary planning are all critical requirements, but these vary with the nature of the tool. Robust testing and governance are already well-defined for more established technologies: the barrier affecting AI and digital health is not that there are too many rules, but rather that existing rules are not compatible with these emerging applications and tools. Regulators are working with innovators to reduce the barriers to implementation: examples include a British Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies which differentiates the regulatory requirements for evidence in proportion to the risk associated with the function of the digital tool in question. 69,70 Similarly, the International Medical Device Regulators Forum provides a framework for patient and public health risk categorisation for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) based on the intended clinical task. 71 This has guided downstream policies such as the US FDA SaMD clinical evaluation framework on the safety, effectiveness, and performance of SaMD. 72 Some researchers have found it useful to use existing clinical governance frameworks to show ethical considerations of deploying new technologies in the clinic. 73 Establishing clear international regulatory standards could enable technologies to be implemented worldwide with less delay. Researchers should place an emphasis on high-quality research to improve the veracity of claims regarding safety and efficacy. 41,67 In addition to clinical validation, multidisciplinary research is required to establish the appropriateness of deploying novel technologies at scale. Economic modelling is of paramount importance to show the cost-effectiveness of new initiatives, and requires detailed consideration specific to the disease, population, and technology of interest. 74\u201376 These analyses are no less important when considering deploying systems internationally, including in LMICs. Where possible, independent teams should conduct these studies, as conflicts of interest are well demonstrated as a source of bias in cost effectiveness analysis. 77 Health-care providers are also wary of relying on black box algorithms for decision making, and although significant research into explainable AI has improved our understanding of how deep-learning models work, further work is required to reduce the opacity of their processes. 78,79 Health-care infrastructural limitations Resource limitations, especially in LMICs, are another major barrier to implementation. Remote areas often lack the necessary infrastructure to adopt new technologies, due to insufficient equipment, poor internet and electricity coverage, and absence of robust telecommunication networks. 26,80 This is compounded by scarce funding, with support impeded by bureaucracy, budget restrictions, and high staffing turnover. 81 Furthermore, there is a worldwide shortage and maldistribution of ophthalmologists for patient assessment and treatment. 6,82,83 The low human resource capacity with essential skills\u2014particularly in digital health literacy\u2014is especially pronounced in LMICs where access to education is restricted, and this impedes the adoption of innovative solutions. 16,84 Committed investment of financial and human capital\u2014perhaps with altruistic input from specialists in higher income countries\u2014is required to overcome these limitations, with successful case studies including AI-assisted diabetic retinopathy screening in India, Rwanda, and Thailand. 30,31 In addition, the challenges in integrating these technologies into existing clinical workflows highlight the need for evaluation of workflow analysis, usability assessments, and human-computer interaction. 31,85 Implementation of digital health solutions with a lower barrier to entry in terms of technological and technical requirements is a promising solution. 37,86,87 Smartphone-based fundus photography used in an automated AI diabetic retinopathy screening programme in India showed high sensitivity of 95\u00b78%, 99\u00b71% and 99\u00b73% in detecting diabetic retinopathy, sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and referrable diabetic retinopathy, respectively. 86 The use of fully automated non-mydriatic retinal cameras requiring minimal operator training has also been proven feasible in outpatient clinics. 88,89 These automated systems could serve as initial tools to triage patients in high-volume mass-screening programmes without a requirement for highly skilled personnel to operate technically complex and expensive equipment. Classification by AI algorithms bypasses the additional step of image grading by a qualified ophthalmologist or grader, featured in asynchronous store-and-forward telehealth models. 75,90,91 This enables efficient triage of patients to avoid saturating the scarce pool of ophthalmologists, with sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy referred more urgently. AI systems could also assist with administrative tasks such as appointment scheduling and inventory management. These systems have the potential to relieve strain on scarce resources in LMICs, reduce delays to diagnosis and to treatment, and facilitate effective provision of care with prioritisation of those in greatest need, maximising outcomes at the population level. Financial costs AI systems often depend on expensive hardware, such as retinal fundus cameras for image data acquisition, graphics processing units for running deep-learning algorithms, and stable high-speed internet connectivity. The short-term and long-term costs entailed by initial development, implementation, and maintenance of these systems represents a substantial barrier to entry for LMICs. 92 Costs can be prohibitive: IDx-DR, the first US FDA-approved AI system for diabetic retinopathy screening, provided negative marginal revenue for service providers. 93 However, these systems could be cost-effective if implemented optimally: cost-minimisation analysis of the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Singapore showed that a semi-automated model (ie, initial AI triage followed by secondary human assessment) was the least expensive arrangement operating with acceptable performance, compared to fully automated and traditional human assessment models. 76 There is a critical requirement for cost-utility analyses of AI systems specific to intended implementation sites, to better understand and justify the resources needed to support real-world implementation. 94 Cybersecurity risk Implementation of digital technology could introduce potential vulnerabilities for penetration and manipulation of confidential patient data. Strengthening of cybersecurity protocols and ethical development is required to mitigate these risks. Examples of cybersecurity measures include user authentication, audit trails, data encryption, and secure data transmission mechanisms. 95 Privacy-preserving digital technology is being developed specifically to minimise cybersecurity risk as innovation continues. Federated machine learning allows data-private multisite collaboration, distributing model training and aggregating model weights without sharing individual patient datasets. 96,97 Another privacy-preserving alternative to data sharing is generative AI\u2014leveraging architectures such as transformers or adversarial networks to synthesise new images to boost the volume and diversity of existing datasets without using more confidential data from patients. 98 The emerging incorporation of blockchain technology also facilitates the secure and auditable exchange of confidential data, safeguarding data integrity and immutability. 54 For example, Tan and colleagues proposed a proof-of-concept permissioned blockchain-enabled platform that enabled the secure sharing of model results and large datasets among three separate sites from two different countries in the development of deep-learning algorithms for myopia detection. 29 These methods could be coupled with blockchain technology to augment AI algorithms without compromising patient data confidentiality and ownership regulations. In general, privacy-preserving mechanisms entail a risk of accentuating biases, affecting minority groups the most in terms of model performance. These competing interests must be balanced in research and development. 99 Creating larger public datasets, representative of the global population, with patient consent could ameliorate issues of bias and privacy, but after many years of AI development, the availability of large datasets of sufficient representation remain few. 100 Curating these datasets is labour-intensive, requiring patient consent, data acquisition, labelling, and quality checks. Nevertheless, existing examples of such datasets prove that they are feasible provided that there is political will and sufficient investment. 100 LMICs might be incentivised to contribute to dataset curation by having first access to the data and subsequently trained models, but this must be carefully balanced against the aim of fostering openness to improve research worldwide. Ethical concerns Ethical AI development requires a priori consideration of the populations the new system is intended to operate on: it cannot be assumed that systems developed using data from one population could be transferred to another without a performance decrement. Overfitting during model training might limit performance, particularly if individuals come from populations unseen during training. 101\u2013103 In 2021, publicly available ophthalmological datasets did not feature patients from 172 countries, representing 3\u00b75 billion people (42% of the world's population). 100 Algorithmic biases could perpetuate inequalities affecting marginalised groups who are often under-represented in training datasets used to develop these systems. 81 Hence, validating algorithms on external test datasets and in real-world settings with representative demographics is essential to facilitate generalisability and clinical translation before implementation. 104 Successful examples exist: AI deep-learning algorithms deployed in diabetic retinopathy screening programmes in Zambia and in an Indigenous primary health-care service in Australia had clinically acceptable performances in detection of referrable and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. 26,105 However, bias arising from sensitive variables inclusive of age or gender might be difficult to eliminate. 106 Furthermore, social determinants of eye health shaping conditions of daily living, such as educational and job opportunities, diet, and social exclusion, influence health outcomes and must also be considered when building AI systems, although such data might not be available on a consistent basis. 1,107 Technical limitations of contemporary digital technology and AI AI and digital technology are not panaceas in global eye health. These technologies cannot replace all aspects of health care and are best framed as assistive tools to augment clinical management. Although diagnostic and management decisions might be clinically appropriate with adequate ocular imaging and ancillary tests, certain aspects of management require physical interaction or surgical intervention, and therefore face-to-face appointments cannot be abandoned. 32,41 Even if algorithms were clinically flawless, practical limitations would preclude autonomous deployment without clinician oversight and interaction. For instance, many fundus photographs generated in screening clinics could be ungradable due to either operator error, poor equipment, or media opacities such as cataract\u2014these will all lead to unnecessary referrals. Engineering unbiased and generalisable models is made more difficult by the limited availability of large, standardised datasets. 100 The process of collecting data for such datasets is a considerable undertaking. In addition to consenting vast numbers of patients from a representative diversity of geographical regions in the training population, data must be collected and labelled accurately by experts. Sufficient patient data must also be associated with clinical data, without making individuals identifiable. Data should be hosted publicly with the use of standardised terminologies, to facilitate reproducibility and external validation efforts. 108 Furthermore, datasets should be reported transparently to enable researchers to gauge their strengths and weaknesses to deal with them appropriately. 100 Take the example in the development and implementation of AI algorithms in myopia, which entails overcoming challenges described here (figure 3 ). For childhood myopia, it is important to consider the influence of clinical and lifestyle risk factors (eg, near work, outdoor time, lifestyle habits) on myopia progression. However, there might be recall bias in the collection of these questionnaire-based input data. Furthermore, feature bias could be introduced into datasets as these risk factors can be influenced by the disparity in socioeconomic status and educational resources globally. 109 These biases within datasets might limit the generalisability of AI models. For adult myopia, there exist doubts in the predictive prognostication of AI due to few effective options and variations in treatment. 20,109 The challenge in collating large-scale and high-quality image datasets is further compounded by technical challenges specific to myopia. For example, it is highly challenging to capture good quality retinal images (eg, fundus photographs, optical coherence tomogram macula) in highly myopic eyes. Furthermore, various pathologies related to pathologic myopia are often present concurrently, resulting in ambiguity in interpretation for labelling and annotation of pathologic myopic lesions. 109 Future directions Establishing a global digital eye health task force with country-level representatives from every region in the world could facilitate organised coordination of efforts and progress toward integrating these digital health tools into eye health systems. Parallels can be drawn from the American Academy of Ophthalmology Telemedicine Task Force, established in 2018 to develop frameworks for standards of data security and workforce training. 110 The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) Technology Taskforce has developed an eye health technology guide targeted at eye care providers and governments. 111 It provides an overview of commercially available innovative devices and technology that enable improved access to eye care services. The IAPB Technology for Access Framework provides a structured guide for nations to assess if any given new technology is appropriate for implementation in their specific setting, in order to have a sustainable effect. 112 Components of the framework include technology readiness in terms of efficacy and safety; systems integration in terms of regulatory frameworks, human resources, and referral pathways for continuity of care; and operating environment in terms of local suitability, service accessibility, and economic sustainability. 112 Global representation empowers nation leaders to influence policy and resource allocation, while tailoring systems to the specific environments feasible in individual countries. 113,114 Bringing different countries together allows for ambitious but realistic targets to be set to improve standards worldwide, while respecting variability in nations\u2019 priorities, capabilities, and challenges. For example, optimal referral criteria depend on individual nations\u2019 health economic status; low-threshold criteria might result in over-referral exceeding resource capacity, whereas high-threshold criteria risk missing patients who require treatment. 26 Members from LMICs can also tap into invaluable lessons learned from real-life use cases in regions with similar geographical and logistical challenges, to guide development and implementation of similar digital technologies. To align with the WHO World Report on Vision recommendations to integrate eye health as part of universal health coverage, eye health services must be prioritised in national health policy planning and budgeting. 1,8,10 In addition to national organisations, public-private partnerships with for-profit and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can play a pivotal role in funding progress. 115 In partnership with the government and the Brien Holden Vision Institute, Pakistan's largest NGO, the Pakistan Layton Rahmatulla Benevolent Trust Hospital, supported optical stores within secondary and tertiary hospitals, to increase patient uptake of prescribed spectacles. 114,116 In Tanzania, a sevenfold increase in patients receiving eye care was achieved thanks to funding from government and NGOs such as Helen Keller International and ORBIS International. 117 The inaugural Toolkit for Glaucoma Management\u2014a practical guide to support integrated glaucoma care services and strengthen sustainable health systems\u2014was developed by sub-Saharan African ophthalmologists, with the support of international organisations including the IAPB and funding from NGOs, Light For The World, and the Else Kr\u00f6ner-Fresenius-Stiftung. 118 Eye health financing includes prioritising coverage of specific types of eye care services and patient subgroups, while striking a balance between operational costs and reimbursements. 119 Existing research on economic analyses of digital health tools and artificial intelligence in ophthalmology is scarce and mostly restricted to diabetic retinopathy screening in high-income countries, while many other diseases exert a higher burden of disease in the rest of the world. 2,75,76,94,120 There is a pressing requirement for greater understanding of the cost-effectiveness and resources required for new digital health tools, in the unique settings of countries with different resource capacities. 1,15,74,76 The push for democratisation of AI in health care should focus on lowering the barrier to entry and empowering LMICs. Existing efforts include publicly available open datasets and automated machine learning (autoML) platforms which reduce or eliminate the need for coding expertise to develop models. 100,121 Some autoML platforms provide cloud-based hosting for large databases and graphics processing units, abrogating the requirement to purchase expensive hardware. Furthermore, it is important to ensure the interoperability of digital platforms for data exchange and standardisation of terminologies and classifications for collaboration as well as standardisation of data terminologies and imaging formats. 95,122 A 2022 systematic scoping review of existing AI applications in LMICs found that none of the studies reported datasets accessible to the public in full, and only a few described the used AI algorithms in detail. 16 There is a need for standardised reporting of AI technologies which is transparent and comprehensive, as outlined by published guidelines such as Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of Decision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (known as DECIDE-AI), which aims to ensure new technologies are critically analyzed and reproducible in other similar settings. 16,123 There is also a need to integrate education on AI into medical training, to equip physicians with the knowledge to appropriately integrate AI into clinical practice. 124\u2013126 More importantly, there is a need for a standardised approach to harmonise and enhance existing AI educational resources which are few and unevenly distributed. 124,125 For example, the Regional Protocols for the Formulation of Public Telehealth Policies for Latin America, sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank, prioritised training and development of telehealth among local health-care personnel. 115\u2013117,127 Recruiting and upskilling local community nurses and optometrists can further boost the capacity of the existing health-care workforce. 81,128\u2013130 These educational efforts could be emulated in initiatives to boost familiarity and competency with newer digital health tools such as artificial intelligence in ophthalmology. Concurrently, governments must take care to avoid a brain drain of these trained personnel from LMICs which could further perpetuate the observed divide with high-income countries. Conclusions Improving eye health remains a global priority as a key to unlocking human potential by reducing the morbidity burden of disease, increasing productivity, and supporting access to education. As global eye care progresses into the next decade, collective action is necessary to leverage emerging digital health and artificial intelligence technology. Further research should focus on scalability and sustainability, to progress beyond pilot studies or one-off initiatives, towards effective, feasible, and sustainable applications with potential for international adoption. Emphasis should be placed on the assessment of human factors in addition to model accuracy parameters, such as usability evaluation, end-user trust, human-computer interaction, and socioenvironmental factors. Clinicians and researchers in LMICs should be involved with research in the field to deliver technological solutions as efficiently as possible. Democratisation of AI and digital health technology is key to maximising uptake, whereas on the ground health-care professionals are best placed to identify logistical barriers. Cultivation of demand-driven research in under-represented regions will generate impactful innovations and valuable data relating to the epidemiology of eye disease, effectiveness of novel technologies in improving eye health, and economic implications of technological interventions. 131 Governmental and non-governmental organisations must collaborate to overcome barriers to implementation, particularly regarding resource scarcity. With multistakeholder collaboration, there is great potential to develop effective, efficient, and equitable solutions by harnessing artificial intelligence and digital health technology.

In doing so, we use a large dataset from 1993 to 2021 with 6550 observations and 138 features and adopt recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence models such as tree-based, boosting and artificial neural network techniques. We find that apart from traditional indicators such as debt and macroeconomic factors; agricultural, energy, health and social factors are strong predictors of an IMF bailout. These factors have hitherto not received much attention in the literature.

Countries that experienced balance of payments (BoP) problems could borrow from the IMF to help stabilize their economies. The IMF functions as the international lender of last resort. Over the years, the Fund has provided financial support to countries experiencing macro fundamental problems through bailout mechanisms. According to Iseringhausen et al. (2019), any member country or government that faces financial trouble, whether low-income, middle-income or rich, can go to the IMF for a bailout. Without a bailout from the IMF in recent times, many of these countries would have struggled to keep their economies afloat due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukraine war. To help overcome BoP challenges and debt crisis, the IMF offers different forms of support such as concessional and non-concessional instruments, surveillance (i.e. policy monitoring and advice), capacity building (in the form of managing public finance and regulatory reforms), and the provision of interest-free loans and other forms of lending facilities. Several studies situated in the context of emerging markets and developing countries, support a positive picture of the likelihood for a country to seek IMF support (Dicks-Mireaux et al., 2000; Dreher and Walter, 2010; Iseringhausen et al., 2019). However, some countries hesitate seeking an IMF bailout because of IMF conditionalities and the negative effects that some countries have suffered after entering into an IMF program (Bird and Rowlands, 2017; Dreher, 2006). For instance, African countries generally had a bitter experience with the IMF due to the painful structural adjustment programs that were implemented in the 1980s and 1990s. Some of these conditionalities included a freeze on public sector employment and wage increases which led to unrest in the labor front, and a freeze or withdrawal in subsidies on food, water, electricity and agriculture. In addition, the IMF has faced massive criticism based on its institutional structure, its level of transparency, and its impact on maintaining the stability of countries that have utilized an IMF program (Dreher, 2006). There is extensive literature that examined the determinants of the likelihood of a country seeking an IMF lending program. For instance, studies have focused on weak economic indicators 2 2 Namely, high debt service ratio, the BoP deficits, low GDP and declining growth rates. (Bird et al., 2004; Ifrah et al., 2021; Iseringhausen et al., 2019); distorted current account balance (Bird and Rowlands, 2017; Joyce, 1992; Knight and Santaella, 1997); and the mismanagement of fiscal and monetary policy instruments (Bird, 2007) \u2013 as the main reasons that force a country to seek an IMF bailout program. In particular, Joyce (1992) use a logit model and find that countries that seek IMF program normally have higher shares of government expenditure, severe current account deficits and smaller reserves. Similarly, Bird et al. (2004) using a Poisson regression model find that repeated users of IMF support have more capital outflows and larger current account deficits. In addition, they also find that these countries normally have lower reserve holdings, investment rates and income per capita. On the other hand, some studies have argued that the credibility of the IMF support program amidst unresolved adjustment policy problems, structural and BoP problems of most participating countries, as well as non-compliance with the conditionality measures are factors that restrain a country from going to the IMF for support (Goldstein and Montiel, 2017; Przeworski and Vreeland, 2000). For instance, Przeworski and Vreeland (2000) use the Heckman selection model and find that most countries seek the IMF program because of foreign reserves crisis. The study also find that countries that stay in the program experience low economic growth. Earlier studies also find no evidence that the IMF program improved balance of payments (Connors, 1979; Reichmann and Stillson, 1978), even though some studies find some improvements (Bird, 1996). Despite these conflicting evidence, countries repeatedly seek for an IMF bailout. The question therefore remains as to: why do countries seek an IMF bailout? The world has seen some of the worst global conditions in recent decades. The COVID-19 pandemic, rising global interest rates, record high inflation rates, the strengthening of the US dollar has posed challenges for many economies. Especially for low-income countries in Africa, there has been an intense debate as to whether countries should seek support from the IMF to secure their ailing economies as a result of these global conditions. Due to their poor economic performance, most of these economies have had credit downgrades and are unable to access international capital markets. Despite these challenges, the political will to seek help from the Fund is a major consideration given the perceived negative political capital for incumbent governments; this usually affects the timing with which these countries seek for help. However, forces beyond a country\u2019s control may force it to seek an IMF bailout. Therefore, this study seeks to understand the factors that lead countries to seek support from the IMF. This is important especially for policy makers because knowledge of these existing factors can help them decide the appropriate timing to seek for assistance. Going too late for assistance may worsen the existing economic conditions of the country. This may prolong the time to have an agreement with the Fund or not have the desired agreement or in a worse-case scenario not get an agreement. Indeed, when the economic conditions are worse, the IMF may impose some strict conditions in a bid to have some stability in the Fund\u2019s financial resources. Our study is, therefore, important to help identify the key factors that leads countries to seek for IMF support. Our main contribution lies in the use of new techniques that are better at predicting outcome variables. Specifically, we use machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models such as tree-based, boosting and neural network techniques. The advantages of these models compared to traditional estimation techniques are that: (i) whether a country seeks an IMF bailout is probabilistic in nature and is a prediction problem which machine learning and artificial intelligence models are better at compared to traditional econometric methods (see Amini et al. (2021)); (ii) ML and AI models can detect non-linearities in the dataset without being explicitly programmed to do so (see Amini et al. (2021) and Gu et al. (2020)). Indeed, many of the variables such as a country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio, foreign currency reserve, BoP, inflation, interest rate and oil price may change in a non-linear fashion in relation to the probability of seeking IMF support and may also interact in unpredictable ways when a country is in financial distress. Thus, our approach allows us to identify and untangle the complex, high-dimensional, and interactive effects that exist between the features that predict a country seeking IMF support. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and presents the methodology used in this study. Section 3 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Section 4 concludes. 2 Data and methodology 2.1 Data The data for the different types of programs accessed by IMF member countries was obtained from the IMF. The sample period is from 1993 to 2021. We obtained the other features (variables) from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and Bertelsmann Stiftung over the same time period. 3 3 The detailed sources of the data and the list of countries are reported in Tables A.1 and A.2 in the Appendix, respectively. Given that the number of years that a country seeks an IMF bailout represents a small proportion of the sample, we use sample overweighting and underweighting approaches in an attempt to improve the predictability of our algorithms. Specifically, we used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) which allows us to overweight the minority class (IMF bailouts). We also explore underweighting techniques such as the RandomUnderSampler from imblearn. 2.1.1 Train/validation/test data split We split the data into train, validation and test sets to enable us judge the performance of our machine learning models on unseen or test data. We employ a Train/Validation/Test ratio split of 60/20/20. In addition, we perform Cross Validation using the K -Folds method and a K of 10 on the training data. Consequently, the training data is split into 10. The artificial intelligence/machine learning models trained or learnt on 9( K \u22121) folds of the data and evaluated performance on 1. Thus, instead of 1 performance metric, we had K or 10 metrics. High cross validation scores are an indication that our models will perform well on unseen data, are stable and have low variance. 2.1.2 Data pre-processing We perform outlier treatment for all the variables in our data set. We first of all compute the inter-quartile range (IQR). The first quartile is represented by the 25th percentile and the third quartile is represented by the 75th percentile. We remove values that are 1.5 times outside this range. We also treated for missing values in the data set using the median filler. 2.2 Machine learning algorithms We adopt various machine learning algorithms to predict the factors that explain why countries seek an IMF Bailout. The algorithms include Logistic Regressions, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks. Our model selection is based on the models that have the highest Recall score, the models that are consistent based on the other evaluation metrics (mainly Precision and the F1 scores), and finally based on models that have the least over-fitting. Machine learning models are known to quickly overfit the data. The consequence of overfitting are that the machine learning models perform extremely well on the training data but have lower performance on unseen data or test data. 2.2.1 Hyper-parameter tuning We select the final models for our prediction after tuning the models. Tuning is important to boost the predictability of our models. Hyper-parameter tuning represents the process of trying to improve the performance of our machine learning models by searching for the best parameters. These parameters cannot be learned from the data and are specified by the programmer. We tune parameters such as the learning rate, the number of estimators, the tree depth, max features, maximum sample size, gamma, scale pos weight, the number of neurons and dropout rates. 2.2.2 Model performance evaluation We use the confusion matrix to help us evaluate the performance of our algorithms. The confusion matrix gives us the number of True Positives, 4 4 This represents our prediction of those who would take an IMF bailout and actually did. True Negatives, 5 5 This represents our prediction of countries who would not take an IMF bailout and indeed they did not seek a bailout. False Positives 6 6 This represents our prediction of countries those who would seek a bailout but they did not. and False Negatives. 7 7 This represents our prediction of those who would not seek a bailout but actually did. Based on the metrics from the confusion matrix, we compute the Accuracy ratio, the Recall Score, the Precision Score and the F1 Score. We measure the performance of our models using the Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1 Score. We do not rely on the Accuracy Score because the data set is imbalanced. The Recall score tells us the percentage of actual IMF bailouts that we are able to predict. Recall is defined as: (1) Recall = True Positive True Positive + False Negative The Precision Score on the other hand tells us what percentage of our predictions of countries going to the IMF are actually correct. Precision is defined as: (2) Precision = True Positive True Positive + False Positive Finally, we examine the F1 Score which is a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. The F1 score is defined as: (3) F1 = 2 \u00d7 Precision \u00d7 Recall Precision + Recall The F1 score ranges between zero and one. A value of one represents perfect recall and prediction. 2.2.3 Feature importances Finally, we examine the feature importances that the machine learning algorithms suggest are important for predicting a country seeking an IMF bailout. The feature importances are a ranking of the features (independent variables) that the machine learning algorithms identify as explaining an IMF bailout. Due to the fact that the algorithms provide a ranking of the features, we are able to determine most important factors that explain why countries seek an IMF bailout. 3 Results and discussion In this section, we present the results from our empirical experiments. We first present information on the characteristics of the data at our disposal. This is followed by results from our model building. We then present results from our hyperparameter tuning which is aimed at improving model by searching for the best parameters. Finally, we present and discuss the results from the feature importances. 3.1 Data characteristics Fig. 1 shows that for the entire data (6550 observations and 138 features), 25% of country years represented years in which countries were in an IMF programme. On the other hand, 75% of country years (4880 observations) represented years in which countries were not in an IMF programme. Consequently, we have a clear class imbalance in our dataset. This provides strong support for our use of class imbalance techniques. Table 1 shows the data we have in the training, validation and training data set. The class distribution on the training, validation and test data are also quite similar and similar to the overall distribution of 75%/25% in the overall data. 3.2 Model building Fig. 2 presents results from using the original data. The original data does not include a treatment for class imbalance. We see that Random Forest produces the highest cross validation (CV) score whilst Ada Boost produces the lowest CV score. The performance across the models are similar but mostly below a CV of 80%. Using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data by increasing the size of the minority class (IMF programme years), in Fig. 3 we see an improved performance (higher CV scores) compared to the original data. Here as well, Random Forest has the highest CV score whilst Adaboost has the lowest CV score. Most of the CV scores are above 90%. Using the Random UnderSampler from imblearn to balance the data by decreasing the size of the majority class (non-IMF programme years), in Fig. 4 we see an improved performance (higher CV scores) compared to the original data. Logistic Regression has the highest CV score whilst Adaboost has the lowest CV score. However, we observe that the performance using over-sampling is better than using under-sampling. Consequently, we performing hyper-parameter tuning using the over-sampled data. 3.3 Hyper-parameter tuning: best parameters Table 2 shows the best parameters for our machine learning algorithms. These parameters are the ones we used in estimating our algorithms. Fig. 5 shows the evaluation metrics after running these models. We settle on the Random Forest because it has some of the highest evaluation metrics and is stable and consistent across both the validation and test data. The feature importances are therefore based on the Random Forest. 3.4 Features importances Fig. 6 shows the feature importances based on the Random Forest classifier. Fig. 6 displays the top 25 factors that predict an IMF bailout. Taking an IMF non concessionary loans is the biggest factor predicting an IMF bailout. This is followed by exchange rate movements, broad money, contributing family workers, and long-term external debt to GDP. To help us explain the feature importances, we group the top features into various categories and examine whether the feature is high or low in a programme and non-programme year. From Tables 3 and 4 we see that IMF bailouts are associated with low financial development. In addition, financial market volatility, represented by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), is a strong predictor of an IMF bailout or programme. In terms of macro factors, as expected, high debts and low reserves predict an IMF bailout. Interestingly, accessing IMF loans (both concessional and non-concessional) are strong predictors of a bailout. This suggests that some countries become regular \u201ccustomers\u201d of the IMF. Furthermore, high inflation and interest rates are associated with a higher likelihood of a bailout. High unemployment is also associated with IMF bailouts. In addition, countries that rely heavily on grants and remittances are more likely to need an IMF bailout. Corruption, low government expenditures and high income inequality are also associated with a higher likelihood of an IMF bailout. From Table 5, we find that agricultural, energy and trade factors are associated with an IMF Bailout. In particular, high levels of agriculture and low information and communications technology (ICT) exports are predictive of a bailout. Low energy consumption and high natural resource rents are also found to be predictive of a bailout. Energy consumption is an indicator of economic activities and thus we observe low energy consumption in bailout years. In addition, the association between high natural resources and a bailout is suggestive of a natural resource curse. In terms of trade factors, high levels of international trade taxes and import duties are shown to be predictive factors of a bailout or IMF programme. From Table 6, we observe that the quality of healthcare is a strong predictor of a bailout. For instance, the levels of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria are all associated with a bailout. Furthermore, the life expectancy is found to be a strong predictor of a bailout. In addition, sanitation, the quality of drinking water, the number of women in parliament and high age dependency are found to be associated with a bailout. 4 Conclusion Using a large data set (6550 observations and 138 features) and employing recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we contribute to the debate as to the factors that predict the likelihood of a country needing an IMF bailout. Our study uncovers many factors that can predict why a country seeks an IMF Bailout. These factors include traditional factors such as high levels of external debt, unemployment, financial market volatility, foreign exchange reserves, tax policy and so on. We also uncover new factors such as the structure of the economy (agrarian), energy factors, trade factors, health related factors, and social factors. Though these factors have not been employed in the extant literature, we find that they are useful at least in a predictive sense in identifying countries that are likely to need an IMF bailout. Overall, our findings suggest that low financial development, high financial market volatility, high levels of debt, poor government quality (e.g. corruption, unemployment, income inequality), high levels of agriculture, services such as ICT imports, poor health services quality, and social factors such as poor sanitation, access to clean water, and gender diversity are strong predictors of a bailout. In addition, accessing previous funds from the IMF (whether concessionary or not) is found to be a strong predictor of a bailout. This suggests that countries become \u201cregular\u201d customers of the IMF. Our work contributes to the financial fragility literature as it provides a way of identifying countries that are vulnerable and may need an IMF bailout. It also provides development financial institutions (DFIs) and countries with a framework to monitor the financial health of countries and pointers or levers to improve their financial resilience and reduce the probability of financial distress or needing an IMF bailout.
