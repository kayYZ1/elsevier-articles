Table 1 Process Process Overview References Sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming with chemical looping combustion (SE-SMR + CLC) The addition of the chemical looping combustion unit, instead of conventional combustor, produces high purity CO2 that can be stored without any additional carbon capture units retrofitted to the combustor. Different oxygen carries have been identified within the literature. di Giuliano and Gallucci (2018), Fern\u00e1ndez and Abanades (2017) and Collins-Martinez et al. (2020) Sorption-enhanced chemical-looping reforming (SE-CLR) In this process, methane reforming and reduction are carried out in one reactor. CLR is a technological development in fuel combustion where oxygen required is supplied by solid oxygen carrier instead of air, such that direct contact between air and fuel is avoided hence, producing high purity CO2, without the need for any capture technology. Bahzad et al. (2019) Sorption-enhanced steam methane gasification (SE-SMG) A gasification reactor is introduced in which biomass is gasified at high temperature to produce syngas and methane. This is then introduced as feedstock to the reformer to produce H2. The use of biomass as a precursor allows for zero emissions but there is a high energy penalty associated with the gasification process. Li et al. (2020) Solar-aided steam methane reforming (SA-SMR) The pre-reformer is added to the SMR process that uses solar power to heat the molten salt. Using solar-assisted heat generation provides low CO2 emissions. Wang et al. (2022) Table 2 Material for blue hydrogen production. Table 2 Molecule Catalyst/Sorbent Reaction Overview References Ni-based Catalyst Catalyst SMR Commonly used for the SMR. Cheaper than using noble metals. Catalyst support via metal oxides (Ni/MgAl2O4) has been introduced to reduce poisoning and increase conversion efficiency. Maqbool et al. (2021) Single Atom Alloy (SAA) Catalyst WGS SAA minimises the use of metal and provides a cost-effective method of using noble-metal catalysts. Saeidi et al. (2017) CaO Sorbent Adsorption CO2 sorbent is used in the SE-SMR process due to the low cost of CaO, and adequate CO2 capture rate. A key issue is a drop in CO2 sorption capacity over multiple cycles due to sintering of CaO. Antzara et al. (2015) Ni/CaO\u2013Ca5Al6O14 Catalyst/Sorbent SE-SMR The Ni/Ca5Al6O14-stabilised bifunctional catalyst shows high stability and CaO utilisation. Xu et al. (2016) Hydrotalcite (HTC) Sorbent SE-SMR Another alternative to CaO owing to its unique layered structure and high surface area. However, the sorption capacity is much lower in comparison to other sorbents. Shahid et al. (2021) Lithium orthosilicate (LTZ) Sorbent SE-SMR An alternative to CaO; It has a high CO2 selectivity and can capture CO2 efficiently within a large range of temperatures (450\u2013650 \u00b0C). It also has a lower regeneration reaction temperature (700 \u00b0C). However, it has a low hydrogen production rate due to a combined effect of low sorption capacity and slow desorption rate. Shahid et al. (2021) Table 3 Common neural network architecture. Table 3 Neural Network Definition Feedforward neural network The simplest architecture for a neural network information travel from the input to the output in one direction, not a deep learning technique due to a lack of automated featured extraction and no backpropagation occurring (Janiesch et al., 2021). Recurrent neural network (RNN) Designed output from any layer is then feedback as an input into previous layers (Pascanu et al., 2013; Panerati et al., 2019a). Designed for time-sequential data, the architecture of the neurons allows for storage of the data to enable sequential learning, simple RNNs have issues such as vanishing gradient (Emmert-Streib et al., 2020). Long-short term memory (LSTM) LSTM is similar to RNNs in that it allows for storage of the data; however, it overcomes the issues such as vanishing gradient (common occurrence in RNN) by introducing a \u201cforget gate\u201d. LSTM has been heavily applied to the analysis of video data (Emmert-Streib et al., 2020). Convolutional neural network Neurons are organised in 3D layers and produce a convolution operation on their input vectors (Alzubaidi et al., 2021). Modular neural network Different networks that function independently form one another, the networks do not interact with one another and work independently in achieving an output (Vaswani et al., 2017). Autoencoders A type of neural network, commonly used in image recognition. It aims to learn data encodings in an unsupervised manner (Bengio et al., 2015). Table 4 Research overview of machine learning within hydrogen production. Table 4 Reference Overview Results and Model Overview Yu et al. (2021) Two ANNs architectures were used and compared to model the performance surrogate model for a 4 bed- 8 step PSA column containing syngas (from a conventional SMR reformer). Data used to train, test, and validate the model was obtained via detailed mathematical software using the LHS strategy. A GA algorithm was applied to both ANNs and was able to produce optimal solutions for the PSA column that enhanced the operational performance of the PSA column. ANN One: five inputs pressure of adsorption, part of adsorption time, feed flowrate, length of activated carbon layer and ratio of purge to feed)., two outputs (purity, recovery), R2 (0.999970), MSE (1.165 \u00d7 10\u22126).ANN Two: five inputs (same as above), three outputs (purity, recovery, and productivity), R2 (0.999950), MSE (1.1164 \u00d7 10\u22124).The results indicate utilising ANNs as surrogate models for optimisation framework are highly accurate whilst significantly reducing the time taken for the optimisation to occur. Subraveti et al. (2019) Developed an approach to the optimisation of an eight-step PSA cycle for pre-combustion CO2 capture. Data used to train, test and validate the model was developed from first-principle process modelling via MATLAB. Four methods were developed the first method was Tradopt, where a GA was applied to first-principle PSA model developed in MATLAB, second method (SOpt), a GA was applied to ANN used as a surrogate model for function evaluations. Method three (DRopt) design variables are identified to reduce the dimensions of the data via partial least squares regression. Method four (DR-SOpt) combines both. SOpt method: reduced computational time with respect to TradOpt (90% reduction in time). The model itself is highly accurate.DRopt significantly reduces the time (\u223c50%) reduction in comparison.DR-SOpt significantly reduces the time to produce optimum operating parameters for high-purity H2. Vo et al. (2020) Developed a dynamic model for the integrated process of H2 recovery and CO2 capture from the tail gas. Dynamic models were combined to predict the performance of the process, to produce high-purity H2 and a CO2 capture rate of 90%. To determine the optimum operating conditions for this process an ANN was developed for each unit, achieving a marginal error of <2% and a low computational cost <12s. The process-driven model was optimised in the production cost of H2 whilst maintaining high H2 purity and a CO2 capture rate of 90%. The cost was 2.045 $/kg with a 99.99% H2 purity and 91% CO2 capture rate. The operating parameters at which this was run at was a membrane area of 1760 m2, adsorption time of 387 s and a purge to feed ratio of 0.106. Pai et al. (2020) FNN was developed as a surrogate model for the screening and simulation of adsorbent and adsorption-based processes. Incorporation of the adsorption isotherm as the input provides rapid screening of larger adsorbent databases. Reduced computational time is required to model the adsorption process, especially for a larger screening of adsorption in comparison to conventional techniques. High prediction accuracy with R2 of 0.995. Tong et al. (2021) FNN was developed to optimise a six-step two-bed PSA System developed in ASPEN plus The ANN developed showed high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.9995). Nkulikiyinka et al. (2020) Two soft sensors machine learning models (ANN and RF) were developed. Using simulation data collected form Aspen Plus Both models were able to provide excellent robust performance for the prediction of gas concentrations in the reformer and regenerator as well as the CH4 conversion, using five specified process features, selected via PCA. Whilst both models were highly accurate in their predictions of the concentrations and the methane conversion, the random forest had higher R2 values and MAE 0.002\u20130.014 for RF, and 0.005\u20130.024 for ANN. Further work must be done on incorporating it into a plant whether laboratory scale or pilot plant. Mashhadimoslem et al. (2021) Utilised ANN to predict the BET surface area and CO2 uptake capacity using the following inputs: precursors, activator, pyrolysis temperatures, pour volumes, adsorption pressure and adsorption temperatures. The R2 value of 0.99 highlights the advantage of using ANN to predict the performance of an adsorbent quickly and effectively. Khurana and Farooq (2016) Developed a two-step screening process for adsorbents. Step one was an ANN that ensure high purity (>95%) and high recovery (>90%). Step two was a meta-model developed for the VSA process ensuring that the adsorbent implemented had minimum energy and maximum productivity for the process. Results indicated the ANN model was highly accurate and several adsorbents were identified that showed a superior performance in comparison to 13X zeolite. Vo et al. (2022) ANN-based optimisation of the SE-SMR process was accomplished to enhance CO2 capture and H2 purity. This ANN-based optimisation was integrated within an economic model, to determine optimum operating conditions at minimum costs. Was found at an H2 purity of 99.99% and a CO2 capture rate of 90.3% can be done H2 production costs of 1.7 $/kg of H2 produced. Alsaffar et al. (2020) Used multi-level perception neural network with back propagation to determine the effects of process parameters on hydrogen yield and CH4 conversion. Compared to ten different neural network architectures, the input of these neural networks: gas hourly space velocity, reaction temp, and CH4/CO2 ratio on hydrogen production. Ten ANN models have compared architecture ranging from 1 to 10 hidden neurons. Nine neurons in the hidden layer were best performing (SSE = 0.076 and R2 = 0.9). Optimisation of the ANN model gave similar predicted results compared to experimental runs. Le et al. (2021) Used an ANN to predict hydrogen production in a catalytic dry reformer, the paper uses literature data to train the ANN. The outputs were hydrocarbon conversion, H2 yield and stability test time. The optimised model produced ARE values of 0.52%, 0.03% and 3.36% respectively indicates obtained models have good generalisation capability, for future predictions. Azzam et al. (2018) Modelled the effect of sintering, pressure and temperature in a dry reformer using a feedforward neural network. This FNN was optimised using a GA, results showed that by periodically optimising the temperatures and pressures to accommodate for the change in the catalyst diameter caused by sintering. The simulation across four years, shows that acceptable operation can be maintained by keeping the temperature at (\u223c1000\u00b0) and increasing the pressure with time. (further studies must be done to incorporate the trade-off of increased pressure and CAPEX/OPEX, an optimisation process that is useful for the industry. Hong et al. (2022) Developed a hybrid DNN for an SMR plant, with data from both pilot plant data and simulation data to optimise the thermal efficiency whilst maintaining low CO2 emissions. The trained hybrid model had an R2 of 0.94 and NRMSE of 3.89 indicating high prediction accuracy. Utilising a hybrid approach improved the reliability of prediction by cross-validation of output variables. A multi-objective optimisation was performed using particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Optimised results shows a thermal efficiency distribution between 77.5% and 87.0% and CO2 emissions between 577.9 and 597.6 t/y. Krzywanski et al. (2018) Used ANN and GA to model and optimise hydrogen production via estimating the hydrogen content in syngas. It compared the circulating fluidised bed (CFB) and bubbling fluidised bed (FB). The data was collected from experimental results. Allows for the global optimisation for this process, for these types of reactors, by adjusting the CaO/C, H2O/C and reaction temperature. The results show that CFB is more effective due to the poorer hear and mass transfer in FB. A hydrogen yield was achieved at 67.4%, with a CFB at temp 775 \u00b0C and a molar ratio of CaO/C and H2O/C at 2.40 and 3.12. Lee et al. (2021) A DNN was developed for the on-site SMR pilot plant with the training and testing data taken from the pilot plant, a model was developed to predict six variables accurately (syngas flow rate, compositions if CO, H2, CO2 and CH4, and steam temperature). The following nine variables were defined and added to the model which was then optimised to have a high thermal efficiency based on a lower heat value, which was 85.6%. Dat Vo et al. (2019) Developed a dynamic multi-scale first principal model of reformer for steam methane reforming, to gather training data for the neural network. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to confirm the four main operating variables that effect the performance (inlet flow rate, temperature, S/C ratio of the reactor side and the inlet flow rate of the furnace side.). The FNN with back propagation, the outputs showed high accuracy (98.91%) with a reduction in the computational time in the simulation when using the neural network (1200s\u20132s). Streb and Mazzotti (2022) ANN was employed as a substitute model to optimise a VPSA (Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption) system for the integrated capture of H2 and CO2. The model was trained using a dataset generated by simulating a 1-D column model, which allowed for the creation of a training dataset, encompassing various feed compositions with four distinct impurities. The developed ANN surrogate model incorporated six KPIs, including the purity and recovery rates of both and H2 and CO2, CO2 productivity, and CO2 specific energy consumption. An R2 of 0.999 indicates high performance from the surrogate model. Finally, an optimisation of the surrogate model was done to assess the energy consumption and productivity of the integrated VPSA surrogate model and then compared it with the conventional model. For both the H2 separation performance specifically low purity and process performance it had a good agreement. When aiming for high-purity H2, the optimised values for energy productivity exhibit a strong sensitivity to H2 purity constraint. This means that even small deviations from the desired H2 purity can result in significant deviations in terms of energy productivity. Across the rest of the Pareto fronts (minimum energy consumption) showed the surrogate model was highly accurate showing that the ANN can be used instead of the full model. Salah et al. (2016) Utilised a NARX structured neural network for simulation purposes, utilise as a surrogate model for the dynamic modelling of SER biomass steam gasification. The data was collected from a 200 kWth pilot plant. The DNN modelled and simulated both the gasifier and regenerator. The neural networks were shown to capture the behaviour of the load change instantaneously but with a maximum estimation error of 15%. Zhao et al. (2021) Compared four machine learning surrogate models for the prediction of H2 produced via supercritical water gasification of biomass. The four machine learning models are random forest, GPR, ANN and SVM. RF seemed to have performed the best for predicting H2 yield. Analysis of the model such as feature importance and partial dependence was utilised to determine the relative importance of biomass properties and parameters. The maximum hydrogen reaction efficiency (45.6%) and energy efficiency (43.3%) were achieved when the feedstock at high Oxygen content and a low H/C ratio. Wang et al. (2022) Developed a neural network as a surrogate model for the solar steam methane reforming using molten salt utilises a hybrid optimisation approach to optimise the developed model and generate an optimal design that is validated. The result shows a total annual cost reduction of 14.9%\u201315.1% and a reduction in CO2 emissions by 4.4%\u20135.2%. Lower LCOH of 2.4 $/kg compared to 2.9 $/kg. Nkulikiyinka et al. (2022) Utilised a novel approach to QSPR to discover new CSCM for SE-SMR. Using data mining, two databases were developed for the prediction of last cycle capacity and methane conversion. The multi-task learning approach was used for the prediction of properties for these materials. Using MTL it was able to predict properties of unseen CSCM with 58% in an AARE of <50%. Yan and Mattisson (2020) Experimental data used to develop a database for 19 manganese ores that have been selected as potential chemical looping oxygen carriers. This data was then used to train several ANNs used to predict the reactivity of oxygen carriers with different fuels and oxygen transfer capacity. Inputs being reactor bed temperature, elemental composition, and mechanical properties of manganese ores. Optimal topology is the number of nodes and how many nodes are in each layer. Stacked neural networks with a bootstrap resampling technique, showed highly accurate predictions with a high R2 (0.94) and low mean absolute error (MAE \u2013 0.057). Saadetnejad et al. (2022) Gas-phase photocatalytic CO2 reduction was analysed via machine learning. Random forest was used to predict the band gap. RF had a RMSE of 0.15, the decision tree had an accuracy of 80%. Ayodele et al. (2021) Applied ANNs to the modelling and prediction of the gasification of plastic and rubber waste. Predicted values closely agreed with the actual values R2 = 0.99. Sezer and \u00d6zveren (2021) Applying ANN to investigate the exergy value of syngas for hydrogen production. Low error value with the predicted exergy value of the syngas. Eduardo et al. (2022) ML approach in order to predict the performance of the catalyst in the WGS rector. A PCA analysis was applied to the dataset to determine key operating parameters for CO conversion. ANN was then applied. As determined in the literature, CO conversion is a function of temperature and not catalyst chemical formulation. ANN predictive model highlights NiCe as a cost-effective catalyst for high CO conversion. Smith et al. (2020) Developed an ML model to predict catalytic activity for the WGS reactor. ANN was developed which related descriptor data with activity. Furthermore, PCA was used to explore the experimental space comprehensively. Neural network shows it\u2019s capable of identifying new catalyst formulation with sufficient information provided. Predictability limitations on activity across catalyst formulation remain. This is due to the information space within the literature remaining unexplored, indicating the literature reported does not properly characterise catalyst formulations. Oh et al. (2022) ANN-based optimisation of the pre-combustion unit for blue hydrogen production. First, a sensitivity analysis was performed before ANN-based optimisation was done. Capturing CO2 gas at 21 bar was evaluated and was found at a 95% capture rate, reboiler duty was 1.364 GJ/tonCO2 captured, a large reduction in the reboiler duty in comparison to conventional post-combustion. ANN optimisation showed a slight further improvement in these results at a much-reduced computational cost. Gul et al. (2023) A SE-ATR reactor was modelled in gPROMS, the model was then optimised via a neural network. A high R2 value (0.99) indicates high predictive capability. Kim et al. (2022) A WGS was modelled and then optimised via a neural network. A comparison was made on the performance of different catalysts. The surrogate model was able to identify optimal operating conditions, for economic and energy-efficient H2 production. Haq et al. (2022) Compared different ML approaches (support vector machines, ANNs, ensembled tree) to the modelling of supercritical gasification of sewage sludge. Support vector machine shows best performance, GA integrated shows highly optimised H2 production for all ML algorithms. Li et al. (2021) Utilised a neural network for the modelling of supercritical water gasification of wet organic waste for H2 production. A screening process was utilised to screen for catalysts. Use of Fe based catalysts provides improved performance, however a low R2 value of neural network (0.86), indicates further improvement is needed within the training process. Chen et al. (2022) A neural network is employed to model the performance of a methanol steam reformer. A GA was employed to optimise the performance.

CO2 concentrations have now exceeded 420 ppm globally, there is a need to decarbonise globally at a rapid rate (IPCC et al., 2023). Since 2015 and the signing of the Paris agreement (UNFCCC, 2015), countries have, at least \u201con paper\u201d, committed to ensuring that global warming does not exceed 2 \u00b0C (with an ambition to limit this to just 1.5 \u00b0C). Within the UK since 2019 and the declaration of a climate emergency. A policy framework has been developed known as \u201cbuild back greener\u201d (DESNZ & BEIS, 2021). This framework outlines a way to ensure the meeting of Net Zero by 2050 in comparison to 1990 levels of CO2 emissions. Part of this strategy to ensure we reach Net Zero is the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, transitioning from oil and gas to renewable resources and an increase in hydrogen production (BEIS, 2021). Deployment of CCS technologies is critical to ensure the continued supply of low-carbon energy within developing countries (Masoudi Soltani et al., 2021). In the UK, a key part of the Net Zero strategy is to develop CCS technologies, especially within industries such as cement and steel (DESNZ & BEIS, 2021). Hydrogen has been identified as a low-carbon energy storage molecule (van Renssen, 2020), and has been identified as a potentially viable alternative to fossil fuels as a clean fuel for transport in the aviation and shipping industry (Ishaq et al., 2022). As of 2021, 94 million tonnes of hydrogen are produced globally, and by 2030, this is expected to rise to a minimum of 105 million tonnes by 2030 (well below the 200 million tonnes required to ensure Net Zero) (IEA, 2021). Hydrogen is already used across a vast range of industries such as steel and fertiliser production (IEA, 2022). It is an energy carrier that when used in a fuel cell, produces no CO2 emissions. Although when used as a fuel, it produces no CO2 emissions, conventional hydrogen production methods lead to high CO2 emissions. As of 2021, 900 million tonnes of CO2 emissions were from hydrogen production (IEA, 2022). There are a number of processes via which hydrogen is produced, these methods are often referred to as the colours of hydrogen shown in Fig. 1 . Among these methods, three routes are of interest: Grey, Blue, and Green hydrogen. Grey hydrogen is the hydrogen produced from fossil fuels; blue hydrogen is hydrogen produced from fossil fuels where the carbon is captured, utilised, and stored. Green hydrogen is hydrogen via electrolysis that is powered by renewable resources. Fig. 2 shows that currently the main and most viable methods of hydrogen production are grey and black. Both methods are associated with high CO2 emissions. Unlike these methods, green hydrogen has no CO2 emissions from the production of hydrogen; however, there are a number of key technologies and economic issues with the scale-up of this technology (Masoudi Soltani et al., 2021). Blue hydrogen presents another viable alternative. In this approach, grey hydrogen production plants undergo retrofitting with carbon capture units to ensure the capture of CO2 produced. This retrofitting allows for the utilisation of the existing infrastructure, enabling a rapid scale-up and deployment of low-carbon hydrogen production. However, the success of this approach, hinges on the effective management of the captured CO2, such as considering the proximity to and accessibility of carbon storage facilities (Masoudi Soltani et al., 2021). The key challenge within low-carbon hydrogen production is the cost of low-carbon routes in comparison to conventional hydrogen production processes. Currently, the cheapest route for hydrogen production is grey hydrogen production. This is due to a variety of factors such as technology readiness level (TRL) of renewable technologies, and the inherent increased operational costs for the separation of CO2 (Masoudi Soltani et al., 2021). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH). It is projected that by 2030, low-carbon hydrogen production routes will be significantly cheaper due to advancements in technology (IEA, 2022). In addition to these advancements in technological development, incentives by government bodies provide support to companies in developing these technologies, these government interventions are vital to ensure that low-carbon hydrogen production is an economically viable alternative (Mazloomi and Gomes, 2012; Quarton and Samsatli, 2021; IEA, 2022). Grey hydrogen is commonly produced via steam methane reforming (SMR) and auto-thermal reforming (ATR). These processes lead to high CO2 emissions (over 900 million tonnes of CO2 per annum as of 2022) (IEA, 2022). Blue hydrogen production provides a pathway to utilise existing infrastructure by upgrading grey hydrogen production plants with carbon capture technologies, such as amine scrubbing. With these technologies being available now, we have an immediate solution to reducing our CO2 emissions. Moreover, there has been further development with this process to increase the process efficiency and intensification via Sorption-enhanced Steam Methane Reforming (SE-SMR) (HyPER, 2019; Barelli et al., 2008). Recent studies have suggested that optimised blue hydrogen processes can be a viable long-term option to ensure that the hydrogen is of high purity and the CO2 is captured and stored (Bauer et al., 2022; George et al., 2022). With the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the middle east and the COVID crisis, the supply chain issue has caused further disruption to energy supplies. Hydrogen has been identified to be a viable energy storage molecule with zero-carbon energy storage (Mazloomi and Gomes, 2012; IEA, 2022). In the UK, producing low-carbon hydrogen is vital to energy security in the forthcoming years (BEIS, 2022). 1.2 Machine learning: incorporation into hydrogen production Machine learning (ML) has shown to be a valuable tool for engineers within the past decade. It has been utilised within chemical engineering across the previous decades; however, there has not been a widespread deployment of the technology due to a variety of reasons (e.g. lack of data, computational power, and data accessibility) (Schweidtmann et al., 2021). Recent trends in machine learning have coincided with cost-effective yet increased computational power with accessible and easy-to-use programming environments (Dobbelaere et al., 2021). Within hydrogen production, the advancement of ML has provided an opportunity for ML to be incorporated into many aspects of hydrogen research (process modelling, optimisation and soft-sensor development). Furthermore, the advancement of novel process configurations such as SE-SMR, provides a need to screen for materials such as combined sorbent catalyst material (CSCM) to further optimise the process. There has been a recent trend to incorporate ML into the process modelling and optimisation of adsorption processes such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA), used in hydrogen production processes to produce high-purity H2. Conventional modelling of this highly-dynamic process is computationally slow, and ML-based models can provide efficient and robust models in comparison to conventional process modelling (Dat Vo et al., 2019; Subraveti et al., 2019; Pai et al., 2020; Vo et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021). With the new industrial wave (industry 4.0) upon us, increasing digitisation of chemical production plants such as hydrogen production has meant research areas such as ML, internet of things (IoT) and automation have become important within the realm of chemical engineering (Ghobakhloo, 2020; \u00d6rs et al., 2020; Lian et al., 2021; Sleiti et al., 2022). Blue hydrogen is becoming an ever-important necessity to enable decarbonisation at a rate to ensure Net Zero by 2050. With green hydrogen currently not at the point to be scaled up, blue hydrogen must be implemented as quickly as possible. Taking advantage of ML can accelerate the deployment of these processes, by providing both cost-effective and time-efficient routes for the development of low-carbon processes. This includes the development of cost-effective yet efficient catalysts and sorbents as well as the optimisation of operational parameters to ensure high hydrogen (and CO2) purity, whilst minimising the costs. 2 Motivation for this paper and the paper\u2019s outlook Recent reviews have been published on blue hydrogen production (Oni et al., 2022), as well as on machine learning within chemical engineering (Mowbray et al., 2022) with some work focused on machine learning within biohydrogen production (Kumar Sharma et al., 2022). To the best of our knowledge, there has been no in-depth technical review of machine learning within blue hydrogen production as of today. Review papers within the last couple of years have mainly focused on machine learning within carbon capture (Rahimi et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021). With blue hydrogen being identified as a key tool to reach a low-carbon economy (Bauer et al., 2022), it is important to further develop and optimise novel low-carbon hydrogen technologies and see how machine learning can be utilised in the development and deployment of these technologies. This review paper provides a comprehensive technical review of the literature on ML within hydrogen production, outlining how ML could potentially overcome common issues within conventional techniques of process modelling as well as the incorporation of machine learning within digital twin technology. To prepare this review, we have scrutinised 153 literature sources within the domain. Our search has been mainly focused on reviewing papers published from 2015 to 2023 which have been mostly indexed by Scopus with some coming from google scholar. Fig. 4 shows the trend in publications on ML, as well as showing the trend of ML in hydrogen production, hence underscoring its importance and potentials in this realm of research. In regards to the methodology, a thorough search was done via Scopus and Google Scholar, where 114 research papers were selected relevant to either conventional process modelling of H2 production or ML within H2 production. The papers selected were then scrutinised and summarised. This painstaking scrutinising led to 54 research papers being included in this review paper. A comparison was made between conventional process modelling and process modelling integrated with ML concerning the accuracy and speed of the optimisation. Issues including a lack of data on simulation time for conventional process modelling were addressed by selecting fewer papers that focused on the speed of simulation and comparing them with the ML-based models. The paper follows with a section on blue hydrogen production methods, discussing in detail, the materials used for blue hydrogen production as well as novel process configurations. Then the latest research within conventional process modelling, simulation, and optimisation of blue hydrogen, processes discusses the challenges associated with conventional process modelling, and how machine learning can help to overcome some of these problems. Then, the discussion delves into the topic of machine and deep learning, exploring the important considerations involved in integrating machine learning techniques into process modelling and H2 production. It then critically evaluates the latest research on the implementation of ML in blue hydrogen production, across both the material scale and process scale. The paper concludes by evaluating the key impacts ML has made on low-carbon hydrogen production and shedding light on future research towards combined ML and hydrogen production. 3 Blue hydrogen production This section provides an in-depth review of different methods of blue hydrogen production including the methods of capturing CO2, as well as a brief review of the sorbents and catalysts that have been used for blue hydrogen production. In-depth reviews of blue hydrogen production can be found elsewhere (Masoudi Soltani et al., 2021; Nnabuife et al., 2022). 3.1 Overview of blue hydrogen processes Hydrogen has conventionally been produced by SMR for decades. This method is categorised as grey hydrogen production, as it produces approximately 9 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of H2. The addition of carbon capture technologies can ensure the CO2 produced is captured and stored, which converts the grey hydrogen production into blue hydrogen production. In a conventional SMR process, the (de-sulphurated) natural gas and steam are fed into the process and are compressed (1\u201325 bara) and heated (650 \u00b0C) before entering the reformer where reactions R1-R3 take place. Heat/energy must be supplied to the reformer due to the reaction being endothermic. The resulting product (i.e. syngas) is then fed to the water-gas shift (WGS) reactor where R2 reactions take place. Fig. 5 shows the conventional SMR process without any carbon capture. R3 highlights the overall reaction during this SMR process. R1 C H 4 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) \u2194 C O ( g ) + 3 H 2 ( g ) \u0394 H 298 K = 206.2 k J . m o l \u2212 1 R2 C O ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) \u2194 C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 ( g ) \u0394 H 298 K = \u2212 41.2 k J . m o l \u2212 1 R3 C H 4 ( g ) + 2 H 2 O ( g ) \u2194 C O 2 ( g ) + 4 H 2 ( g ) \u0394 H 298 K = 165.2 k J . m o l \u2212 1 3.1.1 Steam methane reforming with carbon capture technologies SMR with carbon capture technologies is a similar process as described previously but with the addition of separation steps following the WGS reactor once a significant amount of H2 and CO2 is produced (Antzara et al., 2015). Conventionally, to separate the CO2 from the hydrogen, amine scrubbing has been employed first to separate carbon dioxide from hydrogen, and then the CO2-lean H2 stream is fed to a PSA column for hydrogen purification (Fig. 6 ). The CO2 capture unit can be placed before or after the PSA column. This method allows for existing SMR plants to be retrofitted with carbon capture technology. In addition to amine scrubbing, adsorption processes such as PSA or temperature swing adsorption (TSA) have been identified for not only H2 purification but also CO2 capture (Boot-Handford et al., 2014). These processes can also be retrofitted whilst simultaneously overcoming some of the issues associated with amine scrubbing (lower energy demands for regeneration of sorbent for adsorption processes compared to their absorption counterpart) (Wang and Song, 2020). By introducing extra separation steps within the process there will be an inherent increased CAPEX/OPEX. There has been much work on lower the costs through technological advancements such as developing cheaper catalyst material (Nkulikiyinka et al., 2022) and thermodynamic analysis of the process to ensure optimised heat integration (Antzara et al., 2015). An alternative method to reducing costs is through policy intervention by providing financial incentives to reduce CO2 emissions. Such approaches have been adopted globally to reduce costs of low-carbon and renewable technologies (IEA, 2022). 3.1.2 Sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming SE-SMR intensifies the SMR process equipped with carbon capture. In this process, the sorbent (commonly CaO) is placed in the reformer rather than being used in an individual unit, hence further process intensification. No WGS reactors is theoretically necessary. SE-SMR presents an alternative process configuration (Fig. 7 ), that aims to intensify the process. Integrating the sorbent in the reformer allows for two key process improvements: A. Simultaneous removal of CO2 within the reformer as it is being produced. This shifts the equilibrium to the right (Le Chatelier\u2019s principle) and allows for more H2 to be produced (i.e. improved conversion) (Broda et al., 2013); B. Reduction in coke deposition onto the catalyst via reducing the steam needed, and lowering the reaction temperature, due to the exothermic nature of the formation of the calcium carbonate via carbonisation of CaO (Faheem et al., 2021). Within the reformer, R3 and R4 take place in-situ and together. With the reverse of R4 taking place in the Calciner. R4 C a O ( s ) + C O 2 ( g ) \u2194 C a C O 3 ( s ) \u0394 H 298 K = \u2212 178.8 kJ . mol \u2212 1 The addition of calcium oxide as the sorbent leads to an exothermic reaction and provides heat for further H2 generation via WGS reactions, hence the lack of a need for an additional WGS reactor (Cherbanski and Molga, 2018). There has been some research looking into changing the sorbent due to the issues associated with the cyclability of CaO because of its deactivation after a number of cycles (Shokrollahi Yancheshmeh et al., 2016). 3.1.3 Auto-thermal reforming Auto-Thermal Reforming (ATR) is like the SMR process; however, it introduces O2 within the reformer along with the steam and methane. Here, oxygen reacts with methane according to reaction R5. It is a highly exothermic reaction and the heat generated from R5 helps to carry out the endothermic reforming reaction (R3) (Faheem et al., 2021). R5 C H 4 ( g ) + 2 O 2 ( g ) \u2194 2 H 2 O ( g ) + C O 2 ( g ) \u0394 H 298 K = \u2212 802.7 k J . m o l \u2212 1 3.2 Recent process development of blue hydrogen production There has been further development of blue hydrogen production processes to further optimise for lower cost and higher efficiencies. Table 1 highlights the latest development in low-carbon hydrogen production and summarises the latest advancements in process development to further reduce the CAPEX/OPEX of conventional approaches, increase thermodynamic efficiency, as well as optimising the process to ensure high CO2 capture rates. Some of these works have been detailed in recent literature (Ishaq et al., 2022; Nnabuife et al., 2022; Oni et al., 2022). As shown in Table 1, the main area of process development has been the process intensification by introducing sorbents into the reformer (SE-SMR, SE-SMG, SE-CLR) for combined CO2 capture and H2 production. Furthermore, integrating low-carbon heat sources such as CLC and solar power, provides methods of reducing the CO2 output. Work has also focused on integrating different feedstock (SE-SMR) due to the effect of methane as a greenhouse gas (Howarth and Jacobson, 2021). Conventional process modelling has had an important role to play in development of low-carbon H2 production to assess process feasibility of these novel developments at low-cost. Technologies such as CLC are being integrated into the process to provide a source of low-carbon heat, whilst simultaneously allowing for a reduction in CO2 being released as well as reducing the energy demand for conventional CO2 capture processes such as amine scrubbing (Fan et al., 2012; Bahzad et al., 2019). Conventional process modelling involves the modelling of a process using first-principle equations such as heat and mass transfer, to determine the outputs of a process. Section 4 will provide an in-depth analysis on conventional process modelling and the recent advancements made in regards to H2 production. The recent development of process modelling has looked to incorporate ML within process modelling of hydrogen production. The development of surrogate models of H2 production via ML allows for full process optimisation via the identification of key operating parameters and key performance indicators (KPIs) (Vo et al., 2022). This can also be applied to individual unit operators as well, such as a PSA unit (Subraveti et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2021). Reducing the dimensions of the model through the selection of key operating parameters, allows for increased speed of simulation. This increased speed of simulation, explicitly shown within the dynamic modelling of these processes, allows for improved process control and can provide in-sight in real time of H2 production processes. Section 6 will delve deeper into the application of ML within the modelling of hydrogen production processes. 3.3 Development of materials for blue hydrogen Within blue hydrogen production, research has been focused on developing catalysts, used in the reformer and water gas shift reactors. Commonly nickel-based catalysts are used in the reformer, but there are issues with sintering at high temperatures within a conventional SMR reformer (Maqbool et al., 2021). High-temperature WGS reactors conventionally use copper as the catalyst, which is expensive (Saeidi et al., 2017). More recently, there has been a focus on developing CSCM for the SE-SMR processes (Nkulikiyinka et al., 2022). Table 2 provides an overview of common materials used in blue hydrogen production. In regards to this the development of materials within hydrogen production, modelling these molecules via molecular modelling techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) can provide insight into the interaction between the new material and CO2 molecules or its interaction with CH4. In the realm of material development, ML has found applications in the creation of innovative materials, particularly in the screening of catalysts and sorbents using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods. This has been utilised with the development for CO2 capture materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) (Avci et al., 2018; Dureckova et al., 2019; Burns et al., 2020). In comparison to conventional material screening which involves a trial and error synthesis of compounds, the development of QSAR provides a framework in which vast amounts of compounds can be screened and ranked according to the KPIs (the activity of the material). Further elaboration on this topic will be provided in Section 6. 4 Conventional process modelling within blue hydrogen Numerous low-carbon hydrogen production methods such as SE-SMR and SE-ATR are currently at a low TRL. However, some of these processes are being developed at pilot scale to better understand how to scale them up for optimal heat integration, reformer sizing, and thermodynamic efficiency. This is crucial to ensure high H2 and CO2 purity and a high CO2 capture rate. To achieve an optimised process for low-carbon hydrogen production, it is essential to conduct process modelling and subsequent simulation. There has been a significant amount of research focused on process modelling, simulation and optimisation of low-carbon hydrogen production processes (Sinaei Nobandegani et al., 2016; Phuakpunk et al., 2018; Costamagna et al., 2020; Yan and Thanganadar, 2020; Dat Vo et al., 2021; Faheem et al., 2021; Maqbool et al., 2021; Shahid et al., 2021; Gunawan and Singh, 2022; Nobandegani et al., 2022; Quirino et al., 2022; Babamohammadi et al., 2023; Capa et al., 2023). Here we reviewed the latest research on the process modelling, simulation, and optimisation of blue hydrogen production processes. Specifically, the focus has highlighted the need for an alternative optimisation approach to the conventional optimisation of processes. Conventional process modelling software such as Aspen Plus and gPROMS, model chemical processes via the modelling of physical and chemical properties of the system and the inclusion of unit operators. Significant effort within the past decade has focused on the modelling (both steady-state and dynamic) and optimisation of these blue hydrogen production methods (Costamagna et al., 2020; Yan and Thanganadar, 2020; Dat Vo et al., 2021; Gunawan and Singh, 2022; Nobandegani et al., 2022; Babamohammadi et al., 2023; Capa et al., 2023; Mostafa et al., 2023). The development of blue hydrogen processes has included an array of modelling work. Dat Vo et al. (2021) looked at the dynamic modelling of the reformer, as a circulating fluidised bed reactor (CFB). An SE-SMR process was developed on a semi-central scale, capable of producing 48 tons of hydrogen a day. The simulation showed a reduced production cost of H2 (12%) and a higher energy efficiency (82%) in comparison to conventional SMR (Dat Vo et al., 2021). A sensitivity analysis of main operating variables (temperature, pressure, velocity and S/C ratio) upon process performance, suggests inlet temp of the bubbling fluidised bed is the most important variable as it has considerable effects on production rate, CO2 capture, cost and energy efficiency (Dat Vo et al., 2021). Furthermore, it is important to compare alternative process configurations of SE-SMR to determine the optimum process configuration, that ensures for high CO2 capture rate and high H2 purity. Yan and Thanganadar (2020) investigated six process arrangements that were developed for blue hydrogen production: (1) SE-SMR, (2) SE-SMR + PSA, (3) SE-SMR + CLC, (4) SE-SMR + PSA + CLC, (5) SE-SMR + PSA + Oxyfuel Combustion and (6) SE-SMR + PSA + H2 Recycle. These processes were compared in terms of five key performance indicators via a thermodynamic analysis: Cold Gas efficiency, Net efficiency, CH4 conversion, H2 purity, and CO2 capture. A sensitivity analysis concluded case 4 (SE-SMR + PSA + CLC) was the optimal process configuration for high H2 purity (100%) and a high CO2 capture rate (100%), in which the reformer temperature was 600 \u00b0C, the pressure was 25 bara and S/C ratio was 5. These demonstrate the potential of low TRL technology such as CLC and SE-SMR to produce low-carbon H2 (Yan and Thanganadar, 2020). In the context of process optimisation, sensitivity analysis and other optimisation approaches can be highly informative. By utilising first principle modelling, it becomes possible to gain a thorough understanding of the process and identify the key operating parameters that need to be optimised to achieve high performance in selected key performance indicators (KPIs). However, it is important to note that conventional optimisation approaches, such as sensitivity analysis, typically utilise a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach. Although this approach can be useful in isolating individual operating parameters, it does not reveal how these parameters interact with each other, which may require further analysis. Previous research has focused on utilising the design of experiment (DoE) technique which aims to optimise via the parallel evaluation of the chosen input parameters (Gorbounov et al., 2022). While this technique is commonly used in experimental practices (Gorbounov et al., 2023), some research has explored its application in process modelling and optimisation as well (Sinaei Nobandegani et al., 2016; Phuakpunk et al., 2018; Quirino et al., 2022). Within the literature, work has been focused on using design of experiment (DoE) (Gorbounov et al., 2022), a technique that aims to conduct optimisation via the parallel evaluation of the chosen input parameters. Commonly, the literature has demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in optimising the design of reformers for steam methane reforming, and in optimising unit operators of low-carbon hydrogen production such as SE-SMR. Using DoE for process model optimisation is a useful tool as it allows for the parallel evaluation of multiple input parameters. This has been shown in recent literature with (Babamohammadi et al., 2023) in which they developed a detailed rate-based model was implemented to simulate the reformer in SE-SMR, as well as the SE-ATR processes to investigate the effects of operational variables of the process and their impacts on KPIs including H2 purity and CO2 capture rate. The application of DoE in process modelling is effective in understanding the best operating conditions for maximum efficiency and how different key parameters interact with the KPIs. Recent work has explored computational approaches, such as Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), which splits the dataset into square grids and selects seemingly random data while ensuring variability within the dataset by selecting a square grid containing data from each row and column (Galeazzi et al., 2023). Another notable trend within this multivariable approach has been the development of optimisation algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA), which paired with process modelling can provide a detailed approach for multi-variable optimisation (Cherif et al., 2022). GA is an algorithm for optimisation that mimics biological evolution. The algorithm begins by generating a random population of solutions. At each step individual solutions from the current population are selected to act as parents to generate the next generation. Over successive populations, the algorithm tends towards an optimal solution (Bagherian et al., 2021; Cherif et al., 2022) has focused on using GA for the optimisation of a novel design for an ATR reformer. The novel configuration improved the performance of the ATR, with a reduction in the operating temperature (24.8%), and enhanced CH4 conversion (27.2%). Further optimisation utilising a GA was employed to optimise catalyst arrangements, for maximum H2 yield associated with the lowest local wall temperature. H2 yield slightly increased with a decrease in maximum local wall temperature (39.3%), suggesting an improvement in heat exploitation in the novel design (Cherif et al., 2022). Due to the application of hydrogen within fuel cells, there is a need for extremely high-purity H2 which requires the adaptation of further purification processes. In the realm of blue hydrogen, purification processes such as PSA and TSA are highly dynamic processes carried out in columns. When utilising conventional process simulators, such as Aspen Plus, and optimising by changing relevant operating conditions, simplifications and assumptions are often made due to the computational intensity of simulating non-uniform inlet streams throughout the process. Otherwise, with conventional approaches, the modelling and optimisation will be computationally time-consuming. In the development of digital twins for these processes, ML is a crucial component due to its ability to significantly increase processing speed. The use of ML can significantly increase processing speed and help the model to optimise these processes more accurately while considering the complex dynamics involved in the process. By training models with large datasets of process data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and optimise process variables in real-time to achieve optimal performance, which ultimately leads to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and increased H2 purity. Consequently, machine learning is an essential tool in the development of digital twins for blue hydrogen production, and modelling and optimisation of the process. When optimising adsorption-based processes associated with blue hydrogen production (i.e. TSA and/or PSA), often the cyclic nature of these processes requires a set of non-linear PDEs to be solved until it reaches a cyclic steady state. Conventional modelling and subsequent OFAT approach to optimisation (sensitivity analysis) are computationally slow. Utilising DoE and other optimisation techniques such as GA that allow for multi-objective optimisation (MOO), provides an accurate and computationally quick solution to optimisation problems. Within the literature there has been an increasing trend to utilise ML with GA to optimise processes such as H2 purification, this will be further discussed in section 6. 5 Machine learning: a technical summary and application within H2 production This section first begins with a brief explanation on the methods and principles of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for the reader to build a practical insight into the tools that are used in process modelling, optimisation and material development within blue hydrogen production. The chapter then discusses the recent developments within ML and how they have been incorporated within H2 production. 5.1 Machine learning: an overview ML is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical methods by computers to progressively enhance their performance and outcomes. As Arthur Samuel an AI pioneer put it \u201cmachine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.\u201d (MIT Sloan, 2021). ML effectively describes the process in which machines learn from problem-specific training data. ML is a methodology that enables the enhancement of non-linear systems through optimisation (Rahimi et al., 2021). It can be applied across a vast range of research areas from natural language processing (Hirschberg and Manning, 2015), image classification (Wu and Chen, 2016) and robotics (Correa-Baena et al., 2018). According to different learning modes, ML can be categorised as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is used when the dataset is labelled to understand the relationship between output variables and input variables (Gianey and Choudhary, 2018). There are two types of supervised learning algorithms: classification and regression. Classification algorithms predict discrete output variables from input variables, regression algorithms predict continuous output based on the input variables (Ketabchi et al., 2023). Examples of supervised learning algorithms include: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees and na\u00efve bayes (Gianey and Choudhary, 2018). Unsupervised learning is another learning approach in ML which can be used when the dataset is unlabelled, to find patterns through the data without human intervention (Dey, 2016). Unsupervised learning can be classified into three groups: association, dimensionality reduction and association (Dey, 2016). Clustering is a technique that categorises or separates unlabelled data by identifying similarities or differences (Dey, 2016). On the other hand, association employs a rule-based approach to discover relationships between variables within each dataset (Schweidtmann et al., 2021). Dimensionality reduction reduces the dimensions of the dataset in such a way that the subsequent representation retains meaningful properties of the original data (Yan et al., 2021). Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), has important application within machine learning models of hydrogen production processes to enhance the modelling with respect to speed. Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid technique that combines both supervised and unsupervised learning methods. It leverages a limited set of labelled data to guide the classification and extraction of information from a larger unlabelled dataset (Schweidtmann et al., 2021). Common unsupervised algorithm includes: PCA, K-means clustering, K-mode clustering, Apriori and single value decomposition (Dey, 2016). Reinforcement learning represents a novel approach to learning that distinguishes itself from conventional methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on input-output pairs. Reinforcement learning empowers an agent to learn through trial and error within an environment, leveraging feedback from its own experiences. By providing a set of permissible actions and associated constraints, reinforcement learning obviates the need for a pre-existing training dataset. Instead, it reinforces successful outputs, enabling the development of optimal recommendations for problem-solving (Horvitz and Mulligan, 2015). The agent is the object that seeks to achieve a goal within the environment. The environment provides states in which the agent operates in. The agent uses policy and reward to learn within the environment (Sutton and Barto, 1998). Policy is the method in which to map the actions of a given state. Fig. 8 shows the relationship between these meanings within reinforcement learning. The feedback given to the agent is commonly referred to as a reward. Developing an optimal policy is key to success in reinforcement learning, the agent often faces a problem known as exploration vs exploitation in which the agent must explore new states whilst maximising its reward at the same time (https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-101-e24b50e1d292). ML has recently been utilised in the process modelling of chemical systems for the production of blue hydrogen (Dat Vo et al., 2019; Subraveti et al., 2019; Pai et al., 2020; Vo et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021), and in the molecular screening for novel materials (such as catalysts and sorbents) (Khurana and Farooq, 2016; Avci et al., 2018; Burns et al., 2020; Mashhadimoslem et al., 2021; Nkulikiyinka et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). Process modelling has historically been done within chemical engineering by a physical system represented by mathematical equations that are governed by physical laws, whereas ML-based models utilise data that could come from literature, experimental or first-principle modelling data, and use that data to train ML-based models to simulate or predict the output of the system (CO2 capture rate and H2 purity) (Pistikopoulos et al., 2021). A recent development of ML has been the application within the realm of process modelling. For example, the operation of adsorption columns can be modelled via ML. This also applies to the modelling of reactors specifically applied to hydrogen production (e.g. the modelling of the reformer). In the domain of sorbent synthesis and process optimisation, a significant volume of data is accessible in literature encompassing various sorbents and processes. This data can be employed to train and construct ML-based models. ML provides researchers with tools to model highly non-linear systems. Key factors must be considered such as, ethical considerations like the interpretability of the model when employing them in STEM-related fields (Ketabchi et al., 2023). Nevertheless, multiple ML techniques have been applied within the modelling of these processes such as random forest (RF) which balances interpretability and predictive ability well (Eduardo et al., 2022). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been extensively employed in the literature in low-carbon hydrogen production, due to their flexibility within the architecture. Due to this predominant use of neural networks and deep learning techniques within the literature, the next section will solely focus on neural networks and deep learning methods, outlining how they\u2019ve been advanced within the last decade. 5.2 Artificial neural networks ANNs are non-linear based mapping structures, which maps the input from the output, in between these inputs and outputs are layers of nodes (known as the hidden layer). The output node values are determined by the activation function of the nodes in the hidden layer and the interconnections between the nodes (Yan et al., 2021). Fig. 9 provides a representation of the process. The ANN structure is inspired by the principle of information processing in biological systems (Janiesch et al., 2021). As mentioned previously, a recent trend has been the development of neural networks for modelling engineering processes. Neural networks have been widely employed since the 1940s (Schmidhuber, 2015). There was an initial disregard for neural networks due to a trend towards logical inference (Schmidhuber, 2015). Nevertheless, the combination of the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image identification allowed for a return for the use of neural network. The employment of ANN exploded in the 2010s with the advent of deep learning and big data (Panerati et al., 2019a). A neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The data is passed through the layers to produce an output. The input layer is the data that is initially fed into the network. The hidden layers within the network do the computing and extract the key features to produce an output, which is the layer that provides a result from the input and its interaction with the neural network. Each layer can comprise multiple neurons, the basic structure of the neuron is described in Fig. 10 . 5.2.1 How does a neural network learn? Each neuron receives a multiplied version of inputs and random weights (which is attuned in the learning process). Within the neuron, the weights and inputs from the previous layer are linearly combined, which is then added with a static bias value (unique to each neuron layer). This is then passed to an appropriate activation function which decides the final value to be generated by the neuron (Bengio et al., 2015). This is described in equation (1). (1) z = \u2211 X n W n + b where z is the neuron, Xn is the data input, Wn is the weight applied to each data input to the neuron, and b is the static bias value. Different activation functions are utilised based on the characteristics of input values. The activation function plays a crucial role in determining whether a neuron should be activated or remain inactive. It adds non-linearity to the system (dependant on the activation function) (Bengio et al., 2015). Once the output is generated, the loss function is next calculated (Janiesch et al., 2021). Non-linear activation functions, such as leaky ReLU, enable deep learning (Bengio et al., 2015). The loss function measures the model\u2019s accuracy during the training process. It evaluates how well the model, models the dataset. Within ML the goal is to minimise the loss function to ensure the output generated, matches the output from the original dataset. This minimisation of the loss function is commonly done by gradient descent (Lillicrap et al., 2020). Gradient descent works by starting at a random point and determining the gradient from that point. The descent to minimise this loss function is determined by the direction and the learning rate. These data points are needed to calculate the partial derivatives, to allow it to reach the global minimum (Bengio et al., 2015). The size of the gradient will determine the size of the parameters such as the weight and bias of each neuron. This minimisation of the loss/cost function is done during backpropagation (BP), where the weights and biases of each vector are adjusted to match the output of the actual output (https://medium.com/yottabytes/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gradient-descent-applied-to-neural-networks-d70f85e0cc14). BP plays a crucial role during the learning process as it provides a way for the ANN to converge on a global minimum after multiple iterations of the dataset. BP uses error signals that are feedback into the neurons to adjust the weights and bias, in order to minimise the error within the ANN to ensure the output is correct (Lillicrap et al., 2020). The learning rate determines the rate at which the gradient descent occurs to reach the global minimum, this is a key hyperparameter within the process. If the learning rate is small, then the training of the model is computationally slow and too large, and the global minimum may be missed. The learning rate, and activation function, as well as the number of layers and neurons are known as neural network hyperparameters. These cannot be determined by the learning algorithm and must be set manually (Bengio et al., 2015). An epoch is a key hyperparameter within the learning process. It is when the training dataset has been passed through the neural network once. In general practice, neural networks are typically trained over multiple epochs until the loss function reaches a sufficiently low value. However, the selection of the number of epochs requires careful consideration. If too many epochs are used, the model may become overfit, resulting in a lack of generalisation and robustness in its predictions. Conversely, if too few epochs are employed, the neural network may become underfit, leading to inaccurate output values from the model (https://medium.com/@upendravijay2/what-is-epoch-and-how-to-choose-the-correct-number-of-epoch-d170656adaaf). Commonly, the data used to train the neural network, is split into training, testing and validation data. The training data accounts for most of the data split and is the data that is used to learn the patterns within the dataset; the validation set is used after each epoch and is used to tune the hyperparameters and confirm that the loss function is being minimised. It also ensures that the neural network is not overfitted to the training data. The test set provides unseen data for the ANN in which to determine how well the neural network model performs. Determining the split of training, validation and test data is dependent on a variety of factors. Effectively, there is no \u201cgolden rule\u201d to split the data set (V7labs, 2021). 5.3 Advancements within machine learning ML has been an expanding research field within the last 20 years as mentioned, with application in a vast range of fields. In this section, the advancements are discussed within the context of process engineering and STEM-based research. 5.3.1 Advancements within neural networks Advancements have been made within the last few decades on developing different types of neural networks for different applications. Table 3 provides an overview of recent advancements made within neural network and a brief description of each type. The flexibility of the neural networks, in regards to the type of algorithms used for backpropagation and learning, the networks architecture as well as a choice of loss function and activation function. This flexibility allows for ANNs to be fine-tuned for a specific purpose. Specifically, in that regard, this has led to the development of neural networks that allow for deep learning which will be discussed in the next section. 5.3.2 Advancements within deep learning Deep learning (DL) is a significant branch of ML, especially within the last decade. Complex neural networks, consisting of more than three layers, are employed to analyse extensive datasets (Panerati et al., 2019b). Deep learning provides a way to automate both feature extraction and model building, meaning it can be extremely useful in noisy and unstructured datasets (Janiesch et al., 2021). They contain advanced neurons that use advanced operations. This allows for the deep-learning neural networks to be fed with raw input data to discover a representation needed for the corresponding learning task (automated feature extraction) (Janiesch et al., 2021). DL has become of increasing interest with the development of large language models such as ChatGPT (Birhane et al., 2023). DL and ANNs are commonly referred to as \u201cblack-box\u201d. Within data science, a black-box approach is a model that produces a useful output but is not interpretable (Rudin and Radin, 2019), whereas conventional process modelling software such as Aspen Plus utilises a \u201cwhite-box\u201d approach to modelling in which models are constructed from first principles of physical equations in which mass, momentum and physical equations govern how the process operates (described mostly by partial differential equations) (Bikmukhametov and J\u00e4schke, 2020). However, the time in which to develop these models are high, especially within large processes that have complex non-linear behaviour, such as the production of low-carbon hydrogen. Combining the two-modelling approaches allows for a hybrid model. This type of modelling approach has arisen within engineering and the natural sciences to enforce physical laws within an ML-based framework (Karniadakis et al., 2021; von Stosch et al., 2014; Bikmukhametov and J\u00e4schke, 2020). Combining the interpretability of the first principle-based modelling and the speed of ML models allows for improved modelling and simulation of chemical processes. A recent phenomenon within the natural sciences has been physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in which biases are introduced within the learning process that allow for the learning process to identify physically acceptable solutions (Karniadakis et al., 2021). Three main types of biases can be introduced, observational biases, inductive biases and learning biases. Over conventional modelling, they allow for high dimensional problems to be solved, together with the quantification of uncertainty. Within blue hydrogen production incorporating these PINNs into digital twins could be highly beneficial regarding its hybrid approach of combing data with physical models, allowing for enhanced use within chemical engineering. 5.3.3 Ensemble learning A recent development within ML research has been ensemble learning, which involves combining multiple ML algorithms and combining the predictions produced by each model. Research has shown it to be more accurate in comparison with a single ML algorithm (Zhang et al., 2022b; Mohammed and Kora, 2023). Methods such as RF is a prominent example of an ensemble learning method which combines multiple decision trees to generate a prediction. There are many ways to ensemble multiple ML algorithm such as bagging, boosting and stacking (Alam et al., 2020). A recent development within ensemble learning is its incorporation within deep learning to overcome issues such as high variance within deep neural networks (Alam et al., 2020). Ensemble learning has been used within the modelling of hydrogen production, with it being employed usually to compare against a neural network (Nkulikiyinka et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). RF has been employed as a soft-sensor for predicting the concentrations of gases within the reformer in the SE-SMR process and has shown a slightly better performance in the predictive results in comparison to using an ANN (see section 6) (Nkulikiyinka et al., 2020). It has also been employed to predict the output of the gasification of biomass for hydrogen production, comparing with four different ML methods with RF outperforming them all (Zhao et al., 2021). The improved predictive performance of ensemble learning highlights the benefits of integrating ensemble learning further into H2 production. 5.4 How and why has machine learning been integrated into hydrogen production? In regards to ML integration within process modelling of chemical processes and more specifically H2 production. ML integration within H2 production has often involved the collection of data either through the literature, industry or first-principle simulation. A PCA is often run on the dataset rather than using a \u201craw dataset\u201d, used to reduce the dimensions whilst maintaining accuracy by selecting the key features. These features are then used as the input for the ML algorithm (commonly ANNs), these models are then trained, tested and validated as per the previous section. Often the ML model is developed it is often optimised using a GA, to provide optimal performance of the model and identify operating parameters in which the optimal output occurs. This method has been commonly used within the development of \u201csurrogate\u201d models for unit operators such as the PSA unit (Subraveti et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2021). A vast array of literature has applied this method to either optimise specific unit operators (Dat Vo et al., 2019; Subraveti et al., 2019; Pai et al., 2020; Vo et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021) or entire hydrogen production processes (Alsaffar et al., 2020; Nkulikiyinka et al., 2020; Oh et al., 2022; Vo et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Gul et al., 2023). As mentioned previously ML has been utilised in H2 production within the molecular, material and process scale of modelling. The utilisation of ML and specifically in modelling low-carbon hydrogen production holds significant value. In regards to ANNs specifically the flexible structure allows for easy customisation to suit a wide range of applications, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement-based learning. Moreover, neural networks offer computational efficiency compared to previous models, making them a viable choice. They exhibit high adaptability and can correlate diverse inputs and outputs, which proves advantageous for tackling multi-objective optimisation problems, such as simultaneous hydrogen production and CO2 capture. This flexible structure combined with automated feature extraction provides a computationally quick model, that if trained correctly, can produce highly accurate outputs. However, careful consideration is required to ensure neural networks are trained correctly, such as ensuring an R2 value across the training, testing and validation dataset. Furthermore, an understanding of how neural networks learn is key to ensure accurate and robust models. ANNs/ML integration within process modelling occurs when white box (first principle) modelling is insufficient in regards to developing analytical solutions (the time taken to solve the PDEs). Often in complex processes such as H2 production but specifically for units such as the PSA column for H2 purification. A numerical method increases the efficiency to provide solutions. An in-depth comparison will be discussed in section 6. A thorough understanding of ANNs in relation to the structure (architecture) and the choice of learning algorithm are important to ensure a correct model. 6 Machine learning in blue hydrogen production: a critical Outlook In this section, ML models for both grey and blue hydrogen have been examined, acknowledging the similarities in their processes. Additionally, we have explored and discussed the implementation of ML in these hydrogen production processes, ranging from material screening and development to comprehensive plant optimisation. By doing so, we have shed light on the existing applications of ML and identified areas where its utilisation can be expanded in blue hydrogen production. Table 4 provides a descriptive overview of the research that will be discussed in detail in the sections below. Furthermore, a detailed comparative assessment has been done on the current literature with regards to process modelling. Conventional process modelling has been used as a benchmark to assess ML within blue hydrogen production to highlight the advantages of utilising ML and potential pitfalls. 6.1 Machine learning in material development for hydrogen production Within the realm of material development, ML has been extensively implemented both in the molecular modelling of catalysts and materials for CO2 capture with DFT calculations and molecular dynamics, as well as QSAR (Fiedler et al., 2022) - a method of identifying materials for a select function based on its structure. Within low-carbon hydrogen production, there has been a significant focus on the development of catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This is due to the expense of the platinum catalyst used. Some work has focused on implementing ML within DFT calculations (Ugwu et al., 2022; Bokinala et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023) to discover novel catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Conventional molecular modelling such as DFT requires the solving of the Hamiltonian over time and still requires first-principles calculations to solve the model in order to determine the electronic structure which can then be used in materials screening (Lee, 2015). With regards to material development, ML has been extensively applied within the pharmaceutical industry and catalyst design (Wang et al., 2019; Mehta et al., 2021). It has recently been applied to amine-based carbon capture and blue hydrogen production (Yang et al., 2023), and more recently to adsorbents that have the optimum properties for CO2 capture (Yan et al., 2021). Within blue hydrogen specifically, there has been a focus on the development of novel materials such as CSCM with the development of an ML model for the selection of CSCM that have optimal properties for application within SE-SMR (Nkulikiyinka et al., 2022). Work has also looked at catalyst development within the WGS reactor (Kim et al., 2022) which is often expensive in comparison to the nickel used within the reformer. Some discrepancies have been reported in the literature which affect the screening for catalysts for the WGS reactor (Kim et al., 2022). Future work must correctly characterise catalyst formulation in order for the future enhancement of the WGS process with respect to catalysts. Materials have also been screened for processes such as CLC (Yan and Mattisson, 2020). This highlights the application of ML to material development in blue hydrogen production. It can increase the speed of the workflow for the discovery and synthesis of materials. However, consideration must be given in the use of neural networks as interpretability is of vital importance to ensure an understanding of how and why the structure affects the performance of the material within a process. A recent development has been the integration of the scales of modelling from the material scale to the process scale. ML provides a framework in which sorbents can be screened and then placed in a PSA column to further assess its performance, this has been done for sorbents for CO2 capture with recent work comparing with the industry standard Zeolite 13X (Burns et al., 2020). Furthermore, the interest in metal organic framework (MOFs) for CO2 capture and H2 purification and molecular modelling as well as synthesis of these MOFs has allowed for a large database to be developed (Avci et al., 2018; Dureckova et al., 2019). This database and utilisation of ML has provided a framework for screening and subsequent process scale modelling of these sorbents at high-speed, increasing the speed at which these sorbents can be employed within industry (Saenz Cavazos et al., 2023). Further work can be done on developing databases of materials derived from waste or biological sources. There has been some work in which a neural network was used to select materials/molecules for carbon capture from a database of biological waste sources (Mashhadimoslem et al., 2021). Furthermore, work needs to be done to develop larger databases, as well as further work to determine sources of waste material that can be used as a precursor material for the synthesis of sorbents for CO2 capture to reduce costs and enhance performance in these processes. This QSAR screening for materials using ML, specifically the use of PCA and neural networks, can enhance and optimise the synthesis of this material by utilising PCA. There is the advantage of identifying the key structural parameters that affect the properties. This can then be fed into a neural network to determine the optimum materials that have high performance for the desired purpose, by reducing the dimensions of the model it allows for increased speed whilst maintaining accuracy. Future work must look at increased interpretability too within ML-assisted QSAR. The implementation of ML provides a robust framework (if trained correctly), that is able to screen for materials at high speed. 6.2 Machine learning to enhance process modelling for hydrogen production ML has been effectively used with blue hydrogen production for the optimisation of whole processes, optimisation of individual process units and soft sensors of different process units within the process for the prediction of outputs such as H2 purity and CH4 conversion. Highlighted within this section shows a trend of integrating ML within process modelling for soft-sensor development as well as the use of ANN and GA to optimise both individual process units and whole processes. Furthermore, we look at the recent interest in hybrid modelling and why that allows for improved performance whilst maintaining accuracy and interpretability. The following section provides an in-depth discussion of the ML role has played in the past five years and how it will continue to play a role within H2 production process modelling. 6.2.1 Comparison of conventional process modelling with ML-based process modelling A significant portion of the literature has looked at the optimisation of blue hydrogen production processes using ML via either the optimisation of whole processes, or the modelling of individual process unit. Specifically, process units like PSA which are highly dynamic processes and therefore, development of detailed and dynamic process models and subsequent simulation of these PSA columns are time-consuming (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2022a). There has been a trend towards using ML for the modelling and optimisation of carbon capture processes (Subraveti et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2021). As shown by Subraveti et al. (2019) optimising the PSA column using a neural network and optimisation algorithm provides a quicker alternative than the conventional method of modelling. Some work has also included optimisation of the integrated CO2 and H2 production process such as the incorporation of sorbent into the reformer for both SMR and ATR (Krzywanski et al., 2018; Nkulikiyinka et al., 2020; Vo et al., 2022; Gul et al., 2023). Table 5 shows the simulation time and accuracy of ML-surrogate models for both process units of H2 production and entire processes. Table 5 highlights the increased speeds at which these ML models obtain optimised results when running as a simulation, the increased computational time for first-principle dynamic simulations would be insufficient within an industrial setting whereas developing a surrogate model for either the individual process units or the whole process provides increased speed whilst at high accuracy. As shown in the table when integrating ANNs into process modelling, in order to optimise this surrogate model a GA is used. Utilising GA for the optimisation of ANNs provides a robust framework in which GA can be used to provide optimum KPIs. GA can explore search spaces efficiently to find a global optimum rather than local minima or maxima. Table 6 showcases the conventional process modelling simulation time of both process units and whole processes of hydrogen production, for each case the time taken for the simulation to run is significantly slower with respect to its ML counterparts. This white-box approach to modelling although provides interpretability is significantly slower, due to the process in which it runs the simulation, modelling the dynamic performance of a PSA unit conventionally requires the solving of multiple non-linear PDEs until it reaches a cyclic steady state. Utilising ML can increase the speed at which PSA and H2 production processes can be simulated. Although utilising ML is computationally quick, the accuracy of the model is of great importance. As identified by Rebello et al. (2022) the structure of the neural network is important in relation to the function of the model. A PSA unit for the Fischer-Tropsch was modelled using multiple types of ANNs (FNN, RNN, DNN), these ANNs were both used for simulation and prediction purposes. A comparison was made based on the performance of the ANN for each purpose. It was shown that the ANN architecture significantly affects the performance of the model depending on what function the ANN model is being used for (simulation or prediction). These two predictor structures are known as nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs (NARX) and nonlinear output error (NOE) for nonlinear systems (such as neural networks) (Rebello et al., 2022). NARX depends on past measurements of input and output, in which it assumes errors associated with measurements from input (Rebello et al., 2022). NOE does not depend on past measures of output to make forecasts and assumes errors associated with output. For long-term simulations, NARX is not as good due to the cumulative effect of the error. Within the literature, understanding what neural network can then be used for a specific function to identify which type of neural network, can be applied to the problem at hand. 6.2.2 Soft-sensor development Soft-sensors' ability to provide real-time information dependent on process conditions provides an asset to continuous processes, as it provides an insight into hard-to-determine information that conventional sensors are not able to do. Nkulikiyinka et al. (2020) has shown the benefits of incorporating soft-sensors into blue hydrogen production by comparing RF and ANNs for soft sensors for the reformer and calciner in the SE-SMR process. It allows for improved process control by providing insight into the process that would be hard to determine otherwise. Further work must ensure these sensors are well trained, tested and validated so that once implemented into real-world applications the error is minimised. One new method of doing this is utilising Monte-Carlo techniques within the training process. This approach was applied to a PSA unit in the Fischer-Tropsch process by Costa et al. (2022). Monte-Carlo training employs a stochastic approach to training the neural network in which a Monte-Carlo simulation is run and trains a new model with each sample. This process allows for the identification of the uncertainty in the predictive results of the soft sensor. The same principles can be applied for H2 purification in blue hydrogen production in order to identify the confidence within the prediction the soft sensor makes. This soft-sensor development is of importance within biomass gasification for hydrogen production. There has been increasing research within the area (Ayodele et al., 2021; Sezer and \u00d6zveren, 2021; Kumar Sharma et al., 2022). Due to the variation within the biomass, uncertainty can arise from the gas concentration produced leading to uncertainty in the H2 produced from different biomass samples. ML allows for the quantification of hydrogen production from biomass and can lead to highly accurate predictive models for H2 yield and purity (Ayodele et al., 2021; Sezer and \u00d6zveren, 2021; Kumar Sharma et al., 2022) A key issue within the increased use of neural networks and application within chemical engineering especially with the development of soft sensors, is the interpretability of these models as these models are mostly trained on historic literature data or pilot plants (Schweidtmann et al., 2021), this allows for models to have a large dataset and a model that can accurately model a process based on real-world data. Having a fully developed understanding from a first-principle viewpoint is important to understanding the operational factors that drive the process to ensure a stream of highly pure H2 is being produced, whilst simultaneously the CO2 capture rate remains high. Conventional modelling using software such as gPROMS or Aspen Plus utilises a white-box modelling approach in which the outputs of the process are based on first-principles equations (mass and heat transfer) as well as thermodynamic and kinetic data. A hybrid approach allows for an interpretable model that can either run a simulation or predict outputs of a process at high speed, allowing for informed decision-making to improve the output, which in regard to blue hydrogen production is H2 purity, CO2 capture rate and CH4 conversion. 6.2.3 Hybrid modelling Hybrid modelling allows for greater interpretability of the ML-based model. Literature has discussed this hybrid approach to modelling as a key path forward within process simulation (Zander et al., 1999; Pistikopoulos et al., 2021). A recent development within ML within the natural sciences has been PINNs with a focus on the molecular scale of modelling, combining PDEs within the neural network for the modelling of hydrogen processes could provide significant benefits such as uncertainty quantification, increased speed and robustness of models whilst simultaneously providing greater interpretability to strictly ML-based models. Another method which has been more frequently employed within the literature is a combined approach which uses both first-principle modelling as well as a surrogate model developed via ML to produce an output in regards to the KPIs (Hong et al., 2022; Vo et al., 2022). By utilising this approach, it can enhance interpretability without a significant cost to the increased speed of black box models. Hybrid modelling within blue hydrogen has been increasingly used, especially in regard to integrating the surrogate model with the dynamic model for economic optimisation (Vo et al., 2022). The hybrid approach can be well applied within the industry for H2 production plants providing insight in-real time into the effects of the operating parameters on the KPIs. Specifically, if those KPIs relate to the economic output of the plant (such as the LCOH). Recent works have demonstrated the superior performance of a hybrid approach to optimise economic output (Vo et al., 2022). In regards to blue hydrogen production, this is highly important, since the LCOH of blue hydrogen production is of greater expense, so ensuring these production plants are optimised in regards to economic activity can provide a competitive edge to these processes. The combination of white-box modelling (first principle) with black-box modelling allows for interpretability with increased speed, allowing for interpretable results in-real time. Therefore, the hybrid approach provides engineers working within the H2 production plant, with quick, interpretable results. These results allow for informed decisions to be made to ensure that the productivity of the plant can be increased in real-time. 6.3 Machine learning for whole plant optimisation and digital twins Whole plant optimisation is key to ensure profits are high due to the early TRL for many blue hydrogen technologies (SE-SMR), currently, it is not at the scale for industry use, whereas grey hydrogen is. ML has been used to optimise a whole SMR plant based in Spain, in which a modular neural network to optimise the plant to increase H2 purity and the profitability of the plant (Pardo et al., 2020). There has been little work using plant data due to the early TRL of these technologies, therefore a lack of a large dataset to develop a neural network model. As mentioned earlier, digital twins have become an increasing area of interest within chemical engineering due to increased digitisation and advancements in technology within automation, ML and the IoT. Within the last decades, there has been a rise in the use and development of digital twins within chemical and power plants. Implementing these digital twins within hydrogen production plants can allow for improved process safety (a concern for hydrogen), process optimisation, and enhanced process control for flexible operation in real-time (Shin et al., 2019; Hwangbo and Sin, 2020). This allows for enhanced performance of the chemical plant by increasing product output whilst minimising costs. Furthermore, this increasing digitisation provides a framework in which the hydrogen supply chain can be optimised from production to storage and utilisation in real-time, allowing for optimised scheduling and logistics within the hydrogen supply chain. Furthermore, a key area in which RL can be utilised within process plant is to enhance the cyber security of chemical plants such as H2 production (Santorsola et al., 2022). The transition to industry 4.0 provides opportunity to enhance process control and improve OPEX via increasing automation and the IoT. However, increasing automation may lead to increasing susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Ensuring these cyber-attacks are minimal is key to our energy security (BEIS, 2022). Ensuring hydrogen production plants are safe is key to ensuring a safe transition, whilst reinforcing energy security. 6.4 Machine learning in blue hydrogen production: what\u2019s next? Machine learning has been utilised to great effect within H2 production. Table 7 below provides advantages and disadvantages to utilising ML within H2 across all scales of modelling. Furthermore, the table outlines recommendations of where future research should be directed to further integrate ML within hydrogen production. ML is able to provide increased speed of modelling whilst maintaining accuracy. The scales of modelling in which has been applied to has ranged from the molecular scale to the process scale and whole plant scale. With regards to PSA/TSA modelling lots of work has focused on the optimisation of these processes using ML (specifically ANNs) as well as the development of soft-sensors for this process. As highlighted by Rebello et al. (2022) careful consideration is required in determining the structure of the neural network and the purpose for which the neural network is being used (simulation or prediction). Although this was applied to the Fischer-Tropsch process, the same principles still apply to the H2 purification processes. Similarly, in regards to soft-sensor development, recent work focused on the Fischer-Tropsch PSA unit in regards to the performance of the soft-sensor. Costa et al. (2022) showcased the use of a stochastic training technique to enhance the performance, to be implemented into hydrogen production for not only the PSA unit but also for the reformer, WGS and the whole processes. The integration of RF for soft sensors shown by Nkulikiyinka et al. (2020) highlights the improved process performance of ensemble learning techniques. Future work should incorporate ensemble learning to develop soft sensors for H2 production. Specifically, the employment of a deep-ensemble learning approach to soft sensors of processing units in blue hydrogen production. RL is also a key area in which chemical engineering research has focused on Shin et al. (2019), Hwangbo and Sin (2020) and Khan and Lapkin (2022). Future research should focus on the use of RL in cyber-security. Ensuring H2 production is safe is critical for energy security. With the transition into industry 4.0, there will be increasing digitisation of chemical processes, this digitisation will have an increased risk of cyber-attacks, future research should focus on how RL can be incorporated in regard to process control and cyber security. Another area in which RL can be applied is process synthesis of novel processes. Some work has been done already with Khan and Lapkin (2022) regarding ethylene production in which reinforcement learning was used to develop six process configurations for ethylene production to optimise the process. This application allows for further development of processes that can be further optimised to reduce costs whilst maintaining similar or higher H2 purity and CO2 capture rates. ML has a key role to play within process modelling and material development not only within H2 production but across chemical engineering. Transitioning towards a low-carbon future is essential to reducing the effects of climate change. This transition involves the deployment of infrastructure and industrial processes to ensure this transition happens. ML provides a framework in which to develop these processes (such as blue hydrogen production) at increased speed and ensure that they can make an immediate impact when deployed to ensure the transition is both quick and effective. 7 Conclusion and future prospective Blue hydrogen is a necessity to ensure Net Zero is reached by 2050. The recent development in blue hydrogen production has been applied within three main areas: 1. Discovery and development of novel material and molecules to serve as catalysts for the reforming and WGS reactions and sorbents involved in the CO2 capture process; 2. Optimisation of process performance and predictions of outputs via soft sensors; 3. Dynamic modelling of PSA unit for H2 purification to improve speed of modelling, whilst maintaining accuracy. The utilisation of ML provides increased speeds of optimisation of processes as well as increased speeds of discovery of new materials. This is becoming more critical with climate change being an ever-present threat and our time to reduce the impacts of climate change diminishing. Developing solutions that are effective at an efficient rate is critical. ML impact within blue hydrogen has already shown that it can reinforce and accelerate optimisation on both material and process levels. There is still further improvement in how ML can be implemented within blue hydrogen production. Future work should focus on a hybrid modelling approach to modelling these blue hydrogen production processes as well as the integration of the scales of modelling to further enhance speed whilst maintaining interpretability. With low-carbon hydrogen being an increasing necessity to ensure net-zero to prevent and minimise the effects of climate change. Incorporating ML to enhance the speed of developing blue hydrogen production materials and processes is a necessity to ensure a low-carbon future.

Introduction Machine learning has become a revolutionary tool within materials science research, allowing for quick and precise analysis of complicated material properties, predicting novel materials with desired properties, and optimising fabrication procedures. With previously unseen insights into the molecular and atomic levels of material behavior, its scope also includes improving material discovery, design, and performance prediction [1]. Machine learning techniques have enormous potential to revolutionize how we comprehend, work with, and innovate in materials science as they develop [2]. Machine learning includes various techniques that allow computers to learn and make wise decisions [3]. Models are learned from data with labels through learning under supervision, which enables them to make precise predictions [4]. Unsupervised learning finds structures and patterns in unlabeled data, bringing to light hidden information [5]. Through trial and error, reinforcement learning teaches models to choose actions to maximize rewards [6]. Deep understanding, a subset, uses neural networks to process complex data hierarchies for complex tasks like image and speech recognition [7]. Transfer learning occurs when knowledge is transferred from one job to another, increasing productivity [8]. Probabilities are included in Bayesian methods for modelling uncertainty [9]. For improved accuracy, ensemble methods combine multiple models [10]. The best decision boundaries are produced by Support Vector Machines [11]. Together, these methods drive innovation across industries, advancing artificial intelligence capabilities. Machine learning has sparked a revolution in the synthesis of materials by enabling a diverse array of uses. By using models to predict material behaviors, property prediction speeds up the selection of materials for particular functions [12]. Intricate connections between material structures and desired properties are revealed by structure-property relationships, enabling targeted design [13]. Efficiency is increased by high-throughput screening, which expedites the evaluation of large material libraries [14]. For best results, process optimization optimizes fabrication parameters [15]. Innovation is accelerated by data-driven material discovery, which finds promising candidates in sizable datasets [16]. In material synthesis, generative models produce novel materials with specialized properties that inspire creativity and exploration [17]. Together, these applications redefine the field of materials science, promoting rapid advancement and discovery. Material predictions across domains are revolutionized by machine learning. Property prediction models accurately predict the behaviors of materials, and materials discovery and design quickly produce novel compounds tailored for particular tasks [18]. Critical connections between material structures and desired traits are revealed by structure-property relationships [19]. Manufacturing conditions are adjusted through process optimization, increasing productivity [20]. Extensive material libraries are quickly evaluated by high-throughput screening [21]. Thanks to material characterisation and data analysis, materials science is advanced through accelerated innovation [22]. Machine Learning has transformed image processing, propelling a diverse array of uses. While object identification and localization precisely locate and identify objects within images, image classification accurately labels the images [23]. Understanding is improved by the precise boundaries that are drawn by image segmentation and object recognition. Techniques for strengthening and restoring images improve image quality [24]. Creating lifelike visuals by image generation and synthesis inspires creativity [25]. Understanding and analyzing images delves into intricate patterns for insights [26]. These developments collectively rethink how we process, manipulate, and derive meaning from visual information, revolutionizing the entertainment and healthcare industries. Machine learning innovations in recent years have opened up new horizons for materials research. Microscopic property prediction uses models to predict materials' atomic-scale behaviors, enabling previously unheard-of precision [27]. Complex algorithms are used in material characterization and imaging to extract fine details from extensive data [28]. Data-driven insights are used in material property analysis to unearth hidden correlations and trends [29]. Material discovery and design are sped up through predictive models, producing novel compounds with customized properties quickly [30]. These innovations usher in a transformative era where machine learning reshapes how we perceive and manipulate materials and fuel innovation across diverse fields. While machine learning in materials research has enormous potential, there are also difficulties. Obtaining high-quality labelled data and integrating domain knowledge into models remain challenges [31]. For precise predictions, complex material behaviors and intricate relationships necessitate sophisticated algorithms [32]. Black-box models' interpretability and generalization from sparse data raise questions [33]. It is crucial to consider data usage and bias reduction ethical considerations [34]. Despite these obstacles, machine learning promises quick material discovery, optimization, and innovation [35]. It holds the key to unlocking previously unattainable insights and accelerating materials research, ushering in a new era of scientific exploration and technological advancement by overcoming challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration and algorithmic improvements. The objective of this review article is to offer a comprehensive exploration of the utilization of machine learning in materials research. The first section discusses various machine learning methodologies. The utilization of machine learning in the synthesis of materials is discussed. The substantial contribution that machine learning makes to the prediction of material properties is covered in the following section. The following sections examine recent developments in materials research and the utilization of machine learning to image processing. The paper acknowledges the challenges and prospects in its concluding section. It highlights the need for ongoing research and development to ensure the effective integration of machine learning while realising its exciting potential to influence the direction of materials research. Machine learning methods By utilizing massive datasets and machine learning (ML), which enable computers to learn as they progress, programming has removed many dangers and dead ends [36]. These algorithms can recognize patterns, extrapolate from examples, and change over time [37]. In the literature, various machine-learning approaches are applied to risk assessment [38]. A subfield of computer science called \"machine learning\" seeks to extract patterns from data to improve performance across various activities [39]. Fig. 1 shows different methods of machine learning. Supervised learning Specific objectives are frequently considered during the design process for materials and machines to respond as desired to applied forces or limitations [40]. Supervised learning stands as the predominant form of machine learning. It operates in two steps. The algorithm identifies patterns within the training dataset, consisting of sample sets and labels. Then it transforms these patterns into a mathematical expression known as a model during the training step. This model is utilized to make predictions about samples it hasn't encountered during the inference phase [41]. New technologies, such as Google TPUs and NVIDIA CUDA, have emerged to provide faster data processing as the quantity and size of datasets accessible for research and commercial purposes continue expanding exponentially. [42,43]. Over the past few decades, computation speeds have been rising quickly in 1 arXiv:2006\u201312\u201325 Version 1 (quant-pH) Moores Law, which states that the number of transistors in a compact integrated circuit (IC) doubles roughly every two years, will come into effect on June 22, 2020 [44]. Various techniques provide a function that assigns inputs to the desired corresponding outputs during learning with supervision. The classification problem is a typical example of a learning task with supervision. In this scenario, the learner must approximate the behavior of a function that assigns a vector to one of several classes. This is achieved by analyzing numerous input-output samples of the function [45]. The learning process of a basic machine learning model involves two stages: training and testing. In the training stage, the model is constructed using examples from the training data as input, allowing the learning algorithm or learner to acquire features [46]. Supervised learning is used when labeled data is available for training. It's applied in classification (e.g., spam detection, image classification) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices) tasks [47]. In this learning, models are trained on labeled data, learning the mapping between input features and their corresponding outputs. Algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Neural Networks (in a supervised context) fall under this category [40]. Fig. 2 illustrates the flowchart of the supervised learning process. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a renowned learning algorithm for solving classification and regression problems which is also a kind of Supervised Learning. The complexity and effectiveness of prediction models are significantly influenced by SVM parameters like kernel and penalty parameters [48]. A potent machine learning method that applies the principle of minimizing structural risk is called (SVM). In recent years, there has been a significant surge in the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for conducting Structural Reliability Analysis (SRA) [49]. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) has the potential to enhance accuracy and generalization when estimating implicit functions, owing to its foundation in the structural risk reduction concept and its adeptness at handling small sample learning [50,51]. SVM has shown superior performance compared to SVR due to its ability to mitigate overfitting in regression and its improved response approximation capabilities [52,50]. SVMs work well in scenarios where there's a clear margin of separation between classes. They are effective for classification tasks, especially in high-dimensional spaces, such as text categorization, image classification, and bioinformatics [53]. SVMs are supervised learning models used for classification and regression analysis. They find a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into different classes. SVMs use a kernel trick to transform data into higher dimensions for better separation when the data is not linearly separable [54]. Y. Liu, Wang, et al. developed Auto-MatRegressor, an automated method using meta-learning for predicting material properties. It streamlines accurate ML model building in materials science by automatically choosing algorithms and optimizing parameters. It utilizes 27 dataset meta-features and performance metrics of 18 common algorithms, incorporating domain knowledge via a materials categories tree. Through experiments on 60 datasets, Auto-MatRegressor efficiently selects algorithms, outperforming traditional methods while being adaptable to various materials discovery and design tasks [55]. Unsupervised learning In material research, solid-state physics, biophysics, and biochemistry, examining the extensive quantities of data produced by atomistic and molecular simulations is becoming increasingly important [56]. The performance gap between supervised pretraining and unsupervised visual representation learning, also known as self-supervised learning, in computer vision is quickly shrinking. Self-supervised learning tries to acquire features without manual annotations [57]. Unsupervised learning is useful when dealing with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures within the data. Clustering (like K-means), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE), and generative modeling (GANs) are examples applicable to various domains such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression [58]. Algorithms in this category aim to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data without explicit supervision. Examples include Clustering algorithms like K-Means, Dimensionality Reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data [59]. Fig. 3 devotes the uses of unsupervised learning in different fields. Reinforcement learning For learning-based control, reinforcement learning offers a mathematical formalism. We can automatically develop near-optimal behavioral abilities, represented by rules, for improving user-specified reward functions using reinforcement learning [60]. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have driven significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, surpassing human performance in games such as Atari, Go, and no-limit poker [61]. Central to reinforcement learning (RL) is acquiring a behavioral policy that maps states or situations to actions to maximize the cumulative long-term reward [62]. Deep neural networks and RL were not combined until 2015 when groundbreaking research showed how to make deep RL effective in challenging domains like Atari video games [63]. Since then, deep RL has made quick strides toward scaling and improvement, enabling its use in complex tasks like Go and Capture the Flag [64,65]. The latter advancements frequently entailed combining deep reinforcement learning (RL) with architectural and algorithmic complements, including tree search or using slots for episodic memory [66,67]. Reinforcement learning is applied in scenarios where an agent learns to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment. It's useful in robotics, game playing (like AlphaGo), autonomous vehicle control, and optimizing processes, where learning through trial and error is necessary [68]. This involves training agents to make sequences of decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Algorithms like Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient Methods, and Actor-Critic methods are commonly used in reinforcement learning [69]. Deep learning Deep learning consists of interconnected classifiers built on linear regression and a few activation functions [70]. Shallow learning and deep learning are the two distinct stages of machine learning development. Shallow learning will be restricted to no more than a pair of nonlinear feature conversion layers, as opposed to deep learning's limit of four. The most prevalent shallow structures are Gaussian Mixture Models, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines [71\u201380]. Deep learning's theoretical understanding of the connection between performance, model complexity, and computational needs is still lacking. However, there are compelling arguments for thinking that deep learning depends on processing capacity. This results from the overparameterization problem and how it worsens as more training data are used to boost performance [81]. Deep learning is well-suited for problems with large amounts of data, such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and other complex pattern recognition tasks. It excels in learning hierarchical representations from raw data [82]. This encompasses a broad range of algorithms that use artificial neural networks with multiple layers to extract hierarchical representations from data. Some popular deep learning algorithms include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-related tasks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data, and Transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for natural language processing [83]. Transfer learning While traditional machine learning technology has achieved significant success and found practical applications, it still possesses inherent limitations when applied to specific real-world situations. Transfer learning, a compelling approach in machine learning, offers a solution for the mentioned challenge by leveraging knowledge from one domain to another. The concept of transfer learning is rooted in educational psychology, suggesting this field initially influenced it [84]. There are various transfer learning categorization standards. Transductive, inductive, and unsupervised transfer learning are three categories that categorize transfer learning issues [85]. Transfer learning is beneficial when you have a small dataset in the target domain but a large dataset in a related source domain. For instance, in image recognition, you can use a pre-trained model on a large dataset (like ImageNet) and fine-tune it on a smaller dataset specific to your problem [86]. This technique involves leveraging knowledge from one domain or task to aid learning in another. Algorithms like Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., in NLP - BERT, GPT, etc.) and Domain adaptation (adapting a model trained on a source domain to a target domain) are commonly used in transfer learning [87]. Bayesian methods The arrangement of parameters in the population is generated using a simulation-based method through the Bayesian approach in the current study. The ability of Bayesian Propensity Score Matching (BPSM) to account for uncertainty reduces the arbitrary nature of decisions regarding subclassification in the matching process [88]. In the past, Bayesian inference\u2014which offers precise, complete prediction distributions and precisely calibrated uncertainty\u2014was the gold standard for learning using neural networks. Because of the vast complexity of the parameter space, it isn't easy to scale Bayesian inference methods to deep neural networks [89]. Bayesian methods are used to model uncertainty and update beliefs based on evidence. They're suitable for problems involving decision-making under uncertainty, probabilistic reasoning, and in cases where prior knowledge or assumptions need to be incorporated into the model, like in medical diagnosis, natural language processing, and financial modeling [90]. These methods involve using probability to model uncertainty. Naive Bayes is a simple and popular algorithm, especially for text classification. Bayesian Networks and Bayesian Linear Regression are other examples that leverage Bayes' theorem to update beliefs based on new evidence [91]. Ensemble methods To address the shortcomings of single prediction models, ensemble models have gained popularity recently. Ensemble modelling uses data variability to make up for component model flaws like bias and produce a more reliable solution and resistance to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model mistakes [92]. Numerous researchers have introduced various methods for forming an ensemble. The foundation of one solution (sol1) was obtaining several training data sets. The authors discussed the utilization of bagging and boosting techniques to create such data, and they highlighted that decision tree-based methods are models that use this type of data. Another approach (sol2) included employing various ensemble members as predictive model members [93]. Machine learning models are becoming routinely used prediction tools, both as solo solutions and as ensemble members. Two frequently used prediction methods are neural networks and decision trees, along with different variants of Support Vector Regression (SVR) [94\u201397]. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve performance and generalizability. They're effective in situations where you want to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy, applicable in various domains like finance (predicting stock prices), healthcare (diagnosis), and recommendation systems [98]. This method combine multiple models to improve predictive performance. Examples include Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) with Random Forests, Boosting with algorithms like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting, and Stacking where multiple models are combined using another meta-model [99]. Machine learning in materials synthesis Machine learning (ML) for materials is rapidly transforming many fields to design innovative materials with higher performance [100] rapidly. Materials have a significant impact on how high technology is developed. Impressive advancements in creating new materials have been made due to the need for unique materials with optimum qualities. Big data may be created and accessed more quickly in the short term using experimental and computational methods. In the meantime, following the traditional eras of scientific advancements driven by experiments, theory, and computational simulations, data-driven research has emerged as the fourth scientific paradigm, primarily due to the increasing scale of available data [101\u2013103]. Machine learning (ML), a field combining statistical learning and computer science, has gained prominence recently as a rapidly evolving subfield of data-driven science [104,105]. ML gives us a new strategy for finding new materials distinct from the conventional method of experimentation involving trial and error. To provide direction for material design, machine learning (ML) makes new predictions by comprehending the data's latent patterns [106]. The creation of numerous top-performing alloy materials, such as titanium alloy, nickel alloy, high-entropy alloys (HEAs), aluminium alloy, shape memory alloy, magnesium alloy, bulk metallic glass alloys (BMGs), nickel-based single crystal superalloys [107,108], and copper alloy, has heavily relied on machine learning (ML) over the past ten years [109\u2013115]. For example, although bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) exhibit unique features like high mechanical strength, low magnetic hysteresis, and strong corrosion resistance, it remains crucial to establish dependable methods for correlating these desired traits with specific compositions [116,117]. The utilization of machine learning in the development of novel materials has expanded. It presents fresh chances to quicken and improve searching for novel materials with desired features. Fig. 4 shows examples of how artificial intelligence is used in material synthesis. Property prediction In machine learning, the term \"material prediction\" refers to using machine learning algorithms to forecast materials' characteristics, actions, or results. This method entails evaluating and learning from vast quantities of material data to create models that can generate precise predictions about the characteristics of novel and untested materials. The capability to detect molecules or compounds exhibiting one or more features within a predetermined range makes machine learning-based surrogate models especially well-suited for high-throughput screening endeavours. Discovering \"optimal\" combinations corresponds to finding chemistries on or near the underlying Pareto front. This front represents the best achievable trade-offs among conflicting reactions when a subset of characteristics displays opposing trends or inverse relationships [118]. For a wide range of material classes, including polymers, metals and alloys, 2D materials, ceramics and composites, organic-inorganic hybrids, and multi-component hetero-anionic compounds, machine learning algorithms have been used to find possible non-linear connections involving multiple variables [119\u2013121]. Instances of predicting materials properties with success using machine learning (ML) include estimation of energetics [122\u2013126], stability of phases and arrangement of cations/anions [127\u2013133], defect energetics [134\u2013137], bandgaps [138\u2013142], temperatures at which melting and glass transition occur [143,144], mechanical and elastic properties [145\u2013147], thermal conductivity [148], dielectric properties [149,150], tendency for crystallization [151], catalytic activity [152,153], and radiation damage resistance [154]. Predictive modelling techniques applied to Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations have expedited the discovery of new materials, significantly reducing the search space for upcoming DFT computations and experiments [155]. Since design codes frequently require these qualities, accurate prediction of the mechanical properties of concrete has been an issue. Researchers are pursuing accurate models for forecasting mechanical strength due to the introduction of novel concrete mixtures and applications [156]. Machine learning has a diverse array of uses to predict their property, as shown in Fig. 5 . Structure-property relationship By utilizing self-organizing maps like Kohonen to show structure/property correlations between silver and platinum nanoparticles, data visualization helps comprehend materials datasets and successfully present results [157]. A suitable machine learning approach is utilized to present high-dimensional data within a lower-dimensional framework to make comparing structural features with attributes easier. One such method is the nonlinear dimension reduction method t-SNE which efficiently distinguishes between distinct and comparable items by modelling high-dimensional objects as two- or three-dimensional points [158]. Biological applications and displaying representations from artificial neural networks are only two examples of the many disciplines in which it has been effectively used [159\u2013161]. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) or Kohonen network [162] is a dimensional reduction technique for materials datasets. It is an unsupervised artificial neural network [163] that preserves the topological connection of the input data while reducing high-dimensional spaces to lower-dimensional regions through mapping. SOMs have been used to present data with multiple dimensions as a single two-dimensional plot for further analysis and generating surface texture maps of nanoparticles as unique material identifiers [164]. To identify structure/property connections in metallic nanoparticles, the article contrasts t-SNE with SOMs. SOMs are proven to be more trustworthy and comprehensible for typical materials research datasets, avoiding distortion [157]. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large datasets of material structures and their accompanying attributes to establish correlations between them. The need for energy has increased in significance on a global scale with the growth of contemporary society. Therefore, there is a pressing need to investigate novel materials for sustainable energy systems. Extended experimental duration and significant expenses make traditional approaches challenging for materials research. Machine learning (ML) is currently emerging as a novel approach in research to transform the discovery of novel materials [165]. Many problems facing the 21st century today, such as sustainability and low-carbon energy, are primarily material-related. To ensure the sustainable growth of human society, materials with precise physical and chemical capabilities for adequate storage and conversion of energy are critically needed [166]. Artificial intelligence (AI) advancement creates fresh possibilities for scientific and engineering advances. Big data and artificial intelligence are \"the fourth paradigm of science\" [167]. As ML is a potent tool for uncovering the statistical rule concealed behind highly dimensional data, advancements in ML have recently significantly impacted several industries. With the recent expansion of materials databases, the progressive dissemination of ML toolkits like Tensor Flow, Pytorch, and sci-kit-learn, the creation of workflow toolkits like Atomate, and the advancement of algorithms, ML has also recently seen an increase in use in the area of materials science. ML approaches have effectively produced numerous improvements in materials for storing and converting energy, such as battery materials [168\u2013172] and catalysts, by combining them with big data [173\u2013183]. High-throughput screening In machine learning, high throughput screening (HTS) is a data-driven method for handling massive datasets, automating tests, refining models, and finding insightful information. It hastens research by quickly exploring complicated environments, offering data-driven conclusions, and making headway in many applications [184]. A low-cost method for incorporating transition-metal complexes and materials with open-shell configurations into current high-throughput screening techniques was demonstrated using machine learning (ML). To forecast border orbital energies and Frontier Orbital Nature (FNO) based diagnostics, various ML models were trained. These simulations demonstrated that the HOMO-LUMO gap is more ligand-sensitive, whereas the MR exhibits a higher metal sensitivity. These discoveries offer opportunities for individually modifying the two quantities [185,186]. Density functional theory (DFT) is a key methodology for obtaining atomic electrical interactions. High-throughput screening is difficult due to the computationally costly nature of DFT calculations [187\u2013189]. Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently been used to predict material properties [171,190\u2013192] and molecular structures [193\u2013195], significantly reducing the computational cost. High-throughput studies, in which vast libraries of materials are produced and examined, can be guided by machine learning. According to recent literature, chemists and engineers have given machine learning (ML) and high-throughput experimentation (HTE) separate amounts of attention, which has resulted in the creation of potent reactivity models and platforms that can quickly carry out thousands of reactions [196]. Machine learning (ML) can enhance automated high-throughput chemistry testing in three domains: experimental design, route planning, and data processing. New research suggests that machine learning (ML) approaches hold significant potential in addressing the challenge of automated synthesis planning [197,198]. An expansive domain for exploring and enhancing catalysts results from the intricate interactions between various heterogeneous catalyst properties and operating variables that affect how well they work [199\u2013201]. Trial & error testing has traditionally been used to overcome challenges like this, and it has been successful but time-consuming. The screening of many catalyst compositions for ammonia is a prime illustration. Synthesis carried out by Mittasch and colleagues using a preliminary use of high-throughput experimentation (HTE). In general, HTE experiments are effective at efficiently screening a lot of catalysts. However, they can only \"hit\" a high-performing catalyst in the screened parameter space before they can make a discovery. To direct the tests, it is advantageous to combine HTE approaches with prediction algorithms [202,203] Process optimization In machine learning, process optimization entails using data-driven strategies to optimize processes, simplify workflows, and increase performance, efficiency, and effectiveness. Although complete kinetic schemes for both transport and kinetics in reacting particles are required in comprehensive models of biomass pyrolysis, they are computationally costly and not always feasible for producing sustainable fuels and chemicals [204]. To do this, it is necessary to create comprehensive prediction models that may be used to improve quick pyrolysis methods that turn lignin into valuable renewable fuels and chemicals [205]. As was previously mentioned, the kinetic information in the present comprehensive models is insufficient for this kind of optimization. It has successfully chosen the best model from various training models using dependable and efficient optimization strategies [206\u2013208]. Much effort has gone into maximizing the parameters attained during training, including figuring out the best connection weights and minimizing the training error between projections and related goals. To enhance the precision of the independent Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), optimization approaches [209,210] are typically utilized for ANFIS models to provide membership functions and related fuzzy rules. The optimum ML model configuration is discovered by reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between target and predicted values using an integer-valued optimization technique based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) [211]. Machine learning and optimization techniques are integrated on the shop floor to enhance production processes. This is possible thanks to advancements in the manufacturing sector's digitalization process and the associated data availability. Additionally, a lack of resources encourages people to adopt new ideas more readily, like machine learning, which helps people conserve time, energy, and resources and prevent waste [212]. Process optimization in high-dimensional parameter space is required to provide a scalable manufacturing method for perovskite solar cells [213]. From discovering molecules and extending through process optimization to chemical manufacturing, machine learning is permeating all aspects of chemistry research and development [214\u2013216]. This has caused the introduction of novel, challenging molecular targets with increased three-dimensionality, necessitating a more extensive and sophisticated reaction toolbox [217]. Constructing these more complex processes later is difficult and expensive, and doing so frequently necessitates optimizing both continuous and discrete variables. Before proceeding with the fine-tuning of continuous variables (such as reaction time, temperature, and stoichiometry), it's common to screen various combinations of discrete variables (such as catalyst, ligand, and solvent) using high-throughput screening (HTS) methods [218\u2013221]. However, the time-consuming 'brute-force' approach to HTS (i.e., testing all potential combinations of discrete variables) is losing appeal due to increasingly complicated synthetic techniques. Additionally, since essential relationships among the combined variables are not considered, sequentially optimizing discrete and continuous variables in the workflow results in a limited understanding of the process [222]. Fig. 6 compares the traditional HTS method and newly developed self-optimization in the Mixed Variable Multi-objective Optimization (MVMOO) approach. Data-driven material discovery Materials discovery and design is a data-driven and systematic approach that uses cutting-edge computational tools, high-throughput screening and machine-learning methods to discover and enhance novel materials with specific desired characteristics [223\u2013227]. This results in affordable and custom materials for various applications, propelling technological advancements. Datasets are required to aid in the detection of target traits, qualities, or unidentified materials when using machine learning to solve material issues. Researchers are turning to machine learning to supplement or partially replace the computationally and empirically costly DFT-based material discovery methodologies [227]. Machine learning in material discovery caters to both big and small datasets using distinct methodologies. With big datasets from materials genomics or high-throughput databases, methods like deep learning, ensemble techniques, and feature engineering thrive, harnessing the wealth of information to predict material properties efficiently. Dimensionality reduction techniques aid in handling numerous descriptors. In contrast, small datasets benefit from transfer learning's adaptation of pre-trained models, active learning, or Bayesian optimization to make data collection more efficient and improve model performance with limited data. Strategies like few-shot learning and meta-learning adapt to scarcity by leveraging knowledge from broader datasets, mitigating the challenges posed by limited data. Tailoring machine learning approaches to these scales optimizes material discovery processes, addressing complexities and scarcities inherent in big and small datasets [228\u2013231]. Driven by the emergence of the big data era, data-centric research rapidly expands across diverse fields as it addresses the demand for faster and more systematic solutions to complex problems [175,232]. These techniques have delivered remarkable outcomes in catalysis, including discovering descriptors facilitating catalyst exploration or extracting patterns from spatially and temporally resolved spectroscopic data related to catalysts [233,234]. Machine learning shows the potential to achieve precision comparable to first-principles calculations while maintaining scalability similar to traditional computations [235]. Although there are many and varied applications of data science, catalysis, a discipline where optimization has traditionally relied heavily on trial and error and luck, offers particularly promising potential [236]. Large volumes of data are necessary for machine learning, and the lack of enough data, particularly experimental data, is the bottleneck of catalytic informatics. In this article, we go through three significant issues frequently faced in research focused on catalysis driven by data, specifically when supervised machine learning is utilized to forecast an experiment's results or the characteristics of a catalyst. These issues, particularly the absence of negative outcomes, are also significant in unsupervised machine learning and reinforcement learning, two other forms of machine learning [119]. In data-driven material discovery, several representative works, such as the Materials Project [237], AFLOW (Automatic FLOW for Materials Discovery) [238], and NOMAD (Novel Materials Discovery) [239], employ methodologies integrating computational materials science and machine learning. These projects harness high-throughput calculations, data aggregation, and predictive modeling to explore material properties efficiently. Within this context, Bayesian optimization emerges as a pivotal methodology facilitating the design process. It assists in optimizing experimental parameters, material compositions, or conditions by intelligently selecting the most informative experiments or simulations. Bayesian optimization operates by leveraging probabilistic models to guide the exploration of the vast parameter or design space, effectively accelerating the discovery of novel materials with desired properties. By employing Bayesian optimization techniques, these initiatives streamline the material discovery process, enabling the identification of promising materials for specific applications or functionalities [240]. Y. Liu, Yang, et al. employ data-driven machine learning (ML) for analyzing materials' structure-activity relationships and optimizing their performance, owing to ML's capacity to unveil hidden data patterns and provide accurate predictions. However, the challenge arises from a disparity between vast feature space and limited sample size, impacting ML model performance negatively. Efforts to tackle this include feature reduction, sample augmentation, and specialized ML techniques. Emphasizing a balance between sample size, features, and model parameters is crucial for managing data quantity. A proposed data quantity governance flow integrates materials domain knowledge, enhancing the process. By incorporating domain knowledge into governance schemes, this approach accelerates high-quality data acquisition, expediting materials design and discovery through ML [241]. Generative models Recent developments in deep generative models have facilitated the creation of highly realistic images. This development has prompted questions about the potential abuse of these models, though. The generated images may sometimes exhibit violent or graphic content or unintentionally expose sensitive data used during model training. A well-prepared dataset with adequate purification techniques might reduce the possibility of misusing generative models to address these problems [242]. For instance, as reported, creating DALLE-2 necessitated a meticulous selection of training data to exclude explicit content [243]. Machine unlearning could be used with data preparation and cleaning to help avoid issues when creating and deploying generative models. The objective of machine unlearning is to remove the target data from a pre-trained machine-learning model. This can be necessary to remove biased or damaging content and private information [244]. However, until now, most machine unlearning issues have been concentrated on supervised models [245\u2013250]. Everybody's social media timelines appeared to be 50 years in the future in July 2019. Celebrities, including Drake and the Jonas Brothers, have been seen using the photo-filtering tool FaceApp to appear older. These filtered pictures\u2014branded with the hashtag #AgeChallenge\u2014started appearing on timelines and were frequently so unsettlingly accurate. Discussions regarding the ramifications of high-quality fake photos and data collection by the corporations that develop these technologies have been sparked by the extensive adoption of FaceApp, particularly by young people on social media [251]. A family of statistical models known as \"generative models\" generates novel data instances that mimic training data collection. They are frequently compared to discriminative models, which can distinguish between two distinct data examples. A discriminative model might differentiate between a dog and a cat, while a generative model could create fresh images of cats that resemble real cats. The term \"generative model\" refers to a variety of models, including Autoregressive models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and PixelRNN, VariationalAutoencoders (VAEs). Recent advancements in GANs, among other generative models, have shown notably high accuracy in synthetic media production and have been widely used in popular media. With a particular emphasis on GANs, we study the applications of several generative models in this paper [252]. Y. Liu, Zou, et al. review Generative Artificial Intelligence's (GAI) impact on materials research due to its content generation abilities. Through adopting the Prompt paradigm and reinforcement learning (RLHF), GAI transitions from specific to broader patterns, addressing complex tasks like understanding structure-activity relationships. Their comprehensive review evaluates GAI's development, assesses various model strengths and weaknesses, and explores specific applications such as materials design and data augmentation. Using ChatGPT as an example, they showcase GAI's potential in generating diverse materials content and solving complex problems. Additionally, they identify six challenges in GAI's use in materials science and propose solutions to improve materials data generation for accelerated research and development [253]. Material characterization and data analysis Analyzing experimental or simulated data to understand material characteristics and behaviors, optimizing materials for particular purposes, finding novel materials, and advancing materials science research are all aspects of material characterization and data analysis in machine learning [254,255]. They are essential to advancing materials engineering and make it possible to create better materials for various applications. Since short training sets are frequently used for ML models, it isn't easy to replicate the gains made in other fields. Applying ML algorithms as a rapid fitting method for short, low-dimensional datasets is possible [256]. By limiting the configurational space of materials and concentrating on specific semiconductor groups characterized by unchanging composition or crystalline structures, ML models may be built to handle the problem [141,257]. Another strategy suggested by Zhang et al. [258] involves adding rough property predictions in the feature space, improving prediction accuracy with less degree of freedom and more minor materials data. In conclusion, combining chemical (dis)similarity principles with machine (or statistical) learning methods has demonstrated effective and accurate prediction for various properties in material systems that are not directly linked. Using machine learning, CNOHF can go through how energetic molecule attributes can be deduced from their molecular structure. Active materials have been screened using thermochemical and prohibitively expensive quantum simulation predictions [259]. Compare various molecular feature engineering methods in-depth, including custom descriptors, sum over bonds, Coulomb matrices, fingerprints and Bag of Bonds. Let's talk about the ideal technique to describe aggregate over bonds (bond count), and the perfect model was kernel ridge regression. Considering the short sample size, we can predict explosion pressure, explosive energy, explosion velocity, density, the heat of creation, and other out-of-sample parameters with acceptable errors and Pearson correlations [259]. While convergence with a high molecule count is sluggish, it's noticeable that the error can be reduced by introducing a distinct dataset, including approximately 300 extra molecules during training. Machine learning in image processing Utilizing machine learning for the processing of images is opening doors to discoveries day by day in medical science, material science, autonomous vehicles, security and surveillance, environmental monitoring, agriculture, etc. [260]. This ability to achieve noteworthy results across diverse domains is attributed to substantial progress in data accessibility and increased processing power among professionals. Modern machine learning systems can process image data similarly to the human brain's understanding of images. Numerous strategies are currently being used, including feature extraction, segmentation, identification, and classification, which have changed with the discovery of new dependencies when utilizing machine learning [261]. The capacity of deep learning to autonomously learn hierarchical representations from raw image data has significantly impacted image processing activities, transforming the industry. Many extremely distinct items have very different structures in natural images [262]. This enables the network to learn incredibly sophisticated and various filters, particularly in the deeper layers. One of the promising fields with a focus on medical image analysis is deep learning [263]. Different forms of image processing are shown in Fig. 7 . Image classification In machine learning, training a model to automatically categorize or classify an input image based on its visual information is known as image classification [264]. There are typically two steps to machine-learning-based image classification models: the training and classification phases. The system utilizes a Machine-Learning Algorithm for updating classifier model parameters during the training phase [265,266]. Fig. 8 denotes both the training and classifying phases employ the feature extraction component. The image classifier receives its inputs from the feature vectors of the images. After that, it gives the actual results [265]. Object detection and localization Finding an object in an image and localizing it with a bounding box is a procedure known as detection or localization [267]. Single-class object detection involves recognizing one specific object instance in an image, whereas multi-class object detection involves identifying the classes of all objects present [268]. A technique of Object Detection and localisation has been applied to articulated objects like people [269,270] and stiff objects with a lot of movement, such as faces and cars [271\u2013274]. Object identification requires handling various problems, including partial/full occlusion, shifting lighting conditions, postures, scale, etc. Object detection is the first step in any visual recognition activity, as seen in Fig. 9 [268]. The field of computer vision involves a variety of object detection and localization algorithms and methods [268]. Fig. 10 shows object detection and localization techniques. Image segmentation and object recognition The process of segmenting an image separates it into various portions. It divides the image into segments made up of pixels, with each segment serving as a boundary or mask that designates its place or function within the image [275,276]. This mask divides the image into segments represented by the quantity and variety of segments. Generally speaking, supervised and unsupervised segmentation approaches fall into two groups but due to their quick and dependable performance, semi-supervised segmentation approaches have attracted a lot of interest [277]. In contrast, supervised segmentation algorithms use training examples to include prior knowledge about the image-processing task [278]. The 1990s saw a lot of interest in supervised models, such as atlas-based segmentation techniques [279,280]. Several IT disciplines utilise the image segmentation method, including computer vision, robotics, medical imaging, security procedures, and many more. Object recognition involves identifying objects or items within an image [281]. It uses the inherent characteristics of detected objects in the image to establish familiarity. Machine learning models are employed to recognize objects within images and represent them in a manner that allows each object to comprehend its position or role [282]. It is used in image processing, video analysis, robotics, security processes, user interface design, and many more. Image enhancement and restoration Machine learning approaches for improving image quality, denoising, and repairing damaged or blurry photographs include image enhancement and restoration [283,284]. Deep Reinforcement Learning has found application in various tasks related to image processing. [285\u2013287]. However, these techniques are restricted to simple applications, such as image cropping [284] and global colour improvement [288], and can only carry out global changes for the entire image. However, there are still few deep reinforcement learning (RL) applications for image processing [283]. Enhancing an image to improve its qualities or attributes is known as image enhancement. Improving noisy images requires the real-time design of hardware and algorithms [289]. The development of several real-time enhancement algorithms has included techniques like CLAHE, Retinex [290,291], colour correction [292\u2013295], and classification models [296\u2013299]. This procedure is carried out automatically to enhance image quality using deep learning. Image restoration involves repairing a damaged image, aiming to restore its original quality while safeguarding the unaffected parts of the image. The concepts, images, or pieces lost in a damaged image can be recovered using machine learning [300]. It evaluates the optimal qualities in the prior state for damaged images and displays their advantageous characteristics from that condition [301]. Several methods, including CNNs, autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are used for image restoration [302]. In underwater image restoration, the atmospheric deterioration model developed by Chiang and Chen (2012) is frequently utilized [303]. The CNN technique enhances the image's contrast and colour cast [301]. This method is used for recovery, image restoration, character change correction, etc. Image generation and synthesis Image synthesis for machine learning effectively creates large training data sets, which guarantees optimal distribution, content variety, and the potential to be a crucial component in deep learning training pipelines [304]. Enhancing image generation in the context of machine learning, it is necessary to combine and classify image synthesis methods in the context of image generation, using a taxonomy based on modelling and rendering, and to categorize their application in computer vision applications with a particular focus on computer graphics [304]. The potential for deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN), U-Net, and AE (Auto\u2010encoder) to combine training data is enormous [305\u2013308]. Label-to-MRI translation (synthetic image synthesis) and MRI-to-label translation (image segmentation) are both accomplished using the image-to-image translation conditional GAN (pix2pix) model proposed in [309,310].AE (Auto\u2010encoder)uses convolution kernels to investigate spatially local visual patterns [274]. GANs are composed of a generator and discriminator neural network, where the generator creates synthetic imagery from random vectors, and the discriminator tells the difference between them. This dynamic forces the generator to refine synthesis and produce more realistic imagery [308]. Halder et al. [311] presented a face synthesis method based on geometry modelling, and Patel and Smith [312] used the information of the obscure section as an auxiliary condition to generate a three-dimensional morphable model, both of which were inspired by widely used and achievements in computer vision leveraging geometric knowledge. A technique by Ramalingam and Viet [313] focused on using affordable 3D sensors to synthesize faces to construct or increase the face recognition database. Several works that include statistical learning theory have also been proposed simultaneously [314]. Enhancing their future performance can be accomplished by integrating more data, such as physical restrictions, demographic data, and particular scene information, which has been especially evident in the rapid dominance of [304\u2013307]. Image understanding and analysis Utilizing machine learning methods to identify features and their corresponding data from images for interpretation and analysis. It is capable of locating image components and analyzing or evaluating image attributes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Residual Neural Networks (ResNet), Advanced Convolutional Neural Networks for Machine Vision, etc., are examples of technologies that can be utilized for image understanding and analysis [315]. Most machine vision and image understanding systems have two main steps, as depicted in Fig. 11 . The initial step involves taking the picture data and extracting an appropriate and effective form of knowledge representation. The real-time examination and processing of the image are done in the second stage, typically on the extracted representation [315]. Recent advances of machine learning in materials research Rapid advancements in energy, information science, national defence, and other areas have placed significant and varied demands on materials. However, conventional methods for finding novel materials, such as the empirical trial and error method and the density functional theory (DFT)-based method, typically need a lengthy R&D cycle, are expensive and inefficient, and have trouble keeping up with the current state of materials science. Machine learning is one of the most effective approaches to replace repeated laboratory tests or DFT calculations since it can significantly lower computational costs and expedite the development cycle [316]. In recent materials research, machine learning uses historical data to forecast phase diagrams, crystal structures, and properties with faster and more precise predictions. Also, developing interatomic potentials, real-time analysis of experiments, and mapping complex behavior to process variables [317]. Material scientists increasingly employ machine learning to detect patterns and predict outcomes from data [318]. The field of materials science has a rising opportunity to use and expand upon the developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that are reshaping and restructuring sectors throughout the economy. There is reason to believe that these developments will speed up the discovery, creation, and application of novel materials, bringing materials Scientists one step closer to attaining the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative [318]. Over the past ten years, a rapidly expanding discipline has used ML to design and develop problems in materials science and other fields [319]. ML is unquestionably altering the entire paradigm in practically every sector, including science and engineering. Recent spikes in interest in machine learning (ML) may have led some people to believe ML is a universal fix for all problems. ML may be a helpful strategy for an issue that humans frequently struggle with, such as when the data and their interactions are too complicated and cannot be understood. In contrast, a human could thrive with sparse data, such as determining from a small set of given data that ML cannot accomplish well. Therefore, examining whether the question can be answered using ML before using it in research is essential. The three steps of the ML method are typically as follows [320]. Fig. 12 shows the elementary stages of applying machine learning in materials science. Microscopic property prediction A material's microscopic features, such as its atomic and structural traits, such as the lattice constant, influence its macroscopic performance. As far as we know, machine learning techniques for predicting microscopic properties focus on several factors, such as band energy, lattice constant, molecule atomization energy, and electron affinity. One of the primary hurdles in developing new substrate or buffer materials for semiconductor epitaxy is the lattice mismatch between layers of different materials. The prediction of lattice constants for various element combinations can be expedited using lattice constant prediction. This approach is becoming essential for advancing high technology, as it enables rapid and accurate estimation of lattice constants for numerous unidentified compounds. Machine learning, particularly regression analysis, offers a viable solution for this prediction challenge [321]. Material characterization and imaging Advances in high-resolution imaging techniques have created new opportunities for machine learning (ML) approaches to swiftly and quantitatively analyze functional materials statically and dynamically. This complements traditional methods like modelling, simulations, and synthesis. Historically, characterization focused on qualitative aspects, but contemporary imaging tools, with enhanced resolution and multi-probe capabilities, provide highly detailed quantitative information. Modern real-space imaging methods, such as scanning transmission electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, enable direct visualization of atomic-level structures and functional features in complex materials with multiple components and phases [322\u2013326]. Recent advancements in materials imaging and characterization methods enable the acquisition of high-quality data for functional materials under static and dynamic conditions. These developments stem from cutting-edge techniques such as scanning transmission electron microscopy, tunnelling microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electron backscatter diffraction imaging. Concurrently, enhancing machine learning-driven image recognition offers real-time characterisation data analysis opportunities, reducing workflow bottlenecks in materials development and facilitating knowledge extraction from the data using physics-informed models (Ma et al.) [327]. An ML approach was used to map microstructure images to processing conditions in the context of uranium-molybdenum nuclear fuel alloy. The method achieved strong classification accuracy, with an F1 score of 95.1 %. Using a novel microstructure representation, it successfully differentiated between micrographs related to 10 distinct thermo-mechanical material processing conditions [328]. Ziatdinov et al. used a Gaussian process regression-based extrapolation strategy for the contact Kelvin probe force microscopy method over the spatial and parameter space. The authors also include an interactive Google Colab notebook that describes every aspect of the analyses included in this study as their technique implementation. ML-assisted reliable data is a challenge that Vasudevan et al. [329] experienced. Through a concrete illustration of Bayesian inference applied to studying image generation mechanisms in a ferroelectric thin film, we enhanced the trustworthiness of interpreting intricate scanning probe microscopy data. The utilization of the Bayesian framework highlights its ability to integrate prior material knowledge and facilitate model selection. Material property analysis Machine learning methods are applied to predict and understand material properties by analysing their characteristics [330]. Machine learning algorithms can find patterns, correlations, and predictive models using large datasets of material compositions, structures, and associated property measurements. These models can speed up identifying and improving materials for particular applications, such as finding new catalysts, boosting mechanical strength, or increasing thermal conductivity [331]. Overall, machine learning makes it possible to design materials more effectively and intelligently, which speeds up innovation across numerous industries [332]. Liu et al. [333] underscore machine learning's pivotal role in accelerating the discovery and design of electrochemical energy storage materials, especially in rechargeable batteries. The review highlights ML's state-of-the-art applications, emphasizing its use in feature selection methods to extract crucial material properties. It explores ML's diverse applications in predicting properties and discovering new battery materials, while also pinpointing challenges such as high dimensionality versus small sample sizes, model complexity versus accuracy trade-offs, and potential discrepancies with domain expertise. It proposes strategies to tackle these hurdles and outlines future research directions, showcasing ML's immense potential in optimizing rechargeable battery materials. Liu et al. [321] review how machine learning revolutionizes materials science by significantly expediting the discovery and design of new materials. Its application streamlines processes, enhancing prediction accuracy and time efficiency. The review outlines the basic procedures of ML, algorithmic comparisons, and its diverse applications in predicting material properties and facilitating discoveries. Despite its advantages, challenges such as interpretability and data quality persist. Future efforts aim to integrate computational and experimental approaches for more targeted and efficient material research, ultimately enhancing our understanding of material properties. Shi et al. were the first to identify three primary contradictions that hinder the effective application of ML within the material community: conflicts between learning outcomes and domain knowledge, between model complexity and user-friendliness, and between dealing with high-dimensional data and limited sample sizes [334]. This work effectively reconciles the aforementioned contradictions by incorporating domain knowledge from material science into ML methods. It specifically utilizes crystal structure, bond length, and the coordination environment of local atoms as structural descriptors to establish mapping relationships between structure and energy (force). The study explores the fitting of MTPs across various levmax values and identifies their performance in predicting lattice constants, volumes, and mean absolute errors (MAEs) in energies and forces [335]. To tackle these, the study integrates material science expertise into ML methods, employing crystal structure, bond length, and atom coordination as descriptors. It explores various parameters' impact on predictive performance, like lattice constants, volumes, and error metrics. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing ML's effectiveness in materials research. Liu et al.'s study introduces a novel method called DML-FSdek for selecting material features in machine learning models, addressing challenges in feature selection. Unlike traditional methods, this approach automates the process, integrating domain expert knowledge to avoid crucial feature omission. It demonstrated success in ten material properties datasets, automatically identifying a smaller yet more relevant feature set. This streamlined approach establishes accurate structure-activity relationships, ensuring interpretable results without sacrificing prediction accuracy. In essence, DML-FSdek achieves a more focused material property representation through Multi-Layer Feature Selection [334]. Fig. 13 illustrates different applications of material property analysis. Degradation detection Machine learning surpasses human judgment in precision and practicality when analyzing materials for purposes like identifying metal corrosion, detecting cracks in asphalt pavement, and assessing the strength of concrete [336\u2013340]. In their work from 1996, Agrawal et al. examined how the properties of an alloy, along with its composition and manufacturing process parameters, are connected. They explored the application of machine learning techniques, including feature selection and predictive modelling, to forecast the fatigue strength of steel. The tempering temperature was shown to be the most significant factor influencing fatigue strength out of the 25 features examined. The process has four steps: The raw data were initially preprocessed with domain expertise. Second, high-relevance features were chosen using ranking-based feature selection techniques. The fatigue strength was then predicted using machine learning algorithms. Finally, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation(LOOCV) was employed to assess the models' accuracy [341]. Nanomaterials analysis The importance of machine learning is increasing significantly within the realm of nanomaterials as artificial intelligence advances [342\u2013345]. Applying machine learning to research C60\u2032s solubility dates back to 1993 [346]. The prediction of nanomaterial toxicity, the discovery of novel nontoxic nanoparticles, the development of multi-structure/single-property relationships of NPs, the study of quantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems, the analysis of chemical reactions of nanomaterials, and the solution of kinetic systems have all benefited from the widespread use of machine learning [342\u2013345,347\u2013352]. Molecular property prediction Utilizing high-throughput density functional calculations to forecast molecular properties take a lot of time. Machine learning is a practical alternative that can achieve high accuracy for quick prediction of the structures or properties of materials, compounds and molecules [353\u2013357]. ElemNet is a DNN-based model that uses elements as input to forecast the properties of materials. It swiftly produces precise predictions by automatically extracting the physical and chemical relationships and similarities between elements. Additionally, Ward et al. suggested a broad machine-learning paradigm for forecasting inorganic material properties. This model can predict various characteristics of both crystalline and amorphous materials, such as band gap energy and the potential for forming glass [358]. Material discovery and designing Machine learning (ML) has extended its capabilities in predicting properties, enabling the discovery, design, and production of innovative materials across various applications and categories. It provides new insights into the underlying chemical or physical relationships that govern desired attributes. For example, in the domain of halide perovskites for solar photovoltaics, ML has revealed trends in properties (e.g., bandgap and stability) based on factors such as halogen content and alkali or organic species. This has led to the identification of promising new materials like Cesium Aurous Iodide (Cs2Au2I6) and Ammonium Amide Indium III bromide (NH3NH2InBr3), with the former being extensively studied as a potential solar material [359\u2013362]. Furthermore, employing machine learning to predict materials data across a wide array of elpasolite compounds based on Br and Cl led to the discovery of several promising novel scintillator materials. Over 20 established scintillators were also successfully replicated. Notably, the favourable positioning of Cerium III (Ce3+) 4f and 5d energy levels within the material bandgap was achieved, fulfilling a crucial design requirement for scintillators. These compositional improvements were enabled by the valuable insights gained from machine learning [363]. Fig. 14 illustrates the schema of high-throughput experiments for contemporary materials. Challenges and prospects Challenges Materials science has evolved beyond three approaches, encompassing mathematical theory, simulations, and experimental research [364]. The first-paradigm investigation has no scientific quantitative basis and entirely relies on the observer's intuition. The development of physical models denoted by mathematical calculations, which gave rise to some theoretical underpinnings like the thermodynamics principles for materials study, began only a few centuries ago [365]. As a result of the development of computers decades ago, which enabled the simulation of challenging real-world issues using the knowledge gathered from the second paradigm, the third scientific paradigm is now emerging. Two notable approaches to materials research using big data computing\u2014density functional theory and molecular dynamics\u2014have been proposed [366]. Y. Liu, Ge, et al. developed an automatic descriptors recognizer using NLP for mining descriptors from materials science literature. Their system, integrating a conditional data augmentation model (cDA-DK) and coarse- and fine-grained descriptor subrecognizers (CGDR and FGDR), significantly reduces manual labeling costs. CGDR achieved an 87 % accuracy in recognizing coarse-grained descriptors, while FGDR screened 408 descriptors. They constructed six models with a 96 % prediction performance for activation energy, showcasing the potential of automated descriptor extraction to advance materials design and discovery by understanding structure-activity relationships [367]. Nevertheless, the transition from research to practical application in traditional materials science often spans 15\u201325 years or more, with some promising findings never actually being implemented due to perceived inaccuracies [368]. The prevalence of trial-and-error methods is a significant factor. As materials research deals with extensive data and intricate dimensions, material characterisation techniques are growing [369,370]. Y. Liu et al. present NCOR-FS, a feature selection method using materials domain knowledge to improve feature quality for ML models predicting materials properties. It incorporates Non-Co-Occurrence Rules (NCORs) derived from correlated features, guiding subset selection via a swarm intelligence algorithm. Compared to other methods, NCOR-FS enhances prediction accuracy and model interpretability across seven materials science datasets, showcasing the value of domain knowledge in constructing robust ML models [253]. Both macroscopic and microscopic descriptions can be used to characterize a material's characteristics, such as melting point, hardness, glass transition temperature [371,372], ionic conductivity, lattice constant, and molecular atomization energy. Computational modelling and experimental measurement are the most popular techniques for examining material properties. These two techniques entail intricate procedures and experimental setups. As a result, it is challenging to create computational simulations that accurately represent the complex logical connections between a material's qualities and the causes that affect them, some of which may even be unknowable [373]. Additionally, investigations conducted to gauge a compound's characteristics typically occur toward the end of the materials selection process. As a result, the significant time and extensive experimental resources invested will be wasted if the outcomes are unsatisfactory Investments made up to that time are ineffective. Furthermore, despite enormous computational or experimental efforts, exploring the properties of materials often poses significant challenges or maybe practically unfeasible. The rapid development of intelligent and high-performance prediction models is crucial for accurately predicting material properties efficiently, both in terms of time and computational resources [373] Prospects Although calculations and predictions of material structures and performance can be achieved at various scales using first principles, phase-field theory, molecular dynamics, and finite element analysis (FEA), these models are usually tailored to particular material systems. It can still not satisfy the demands of several descriptions for various qualities, which severely limits future material research. These issues are starting to be solved as artificial intelligence is promoted and made more widely known, bringing materials research to the fourth scientific paradigm. The fourth paradigm of materials science, also known as big data-driven science, is currently emerging in materials research, which has profited from the massive amounts of data produced by experiments and computation techniques like first principles and molecular dynamics theory [374]. Additionally, increased applications of high-throughput computers in materials research are causing the data to grow quicker than ever [368]. The emergence of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has led to a growing focus on using machine learning (ML) for predicting material properties and discovering novel materials, making it a vibrant area of study [353]. Machine learning has found widespread application in predicting properties, exploring novel materials, and delving into quantum chemistry due to its robust predictive capabilities and cost efficiency. However, employing machine learning in materials science poses several challenges. For instance, the scarcity of high-quality materials data hinders accurate property descriptions, and prediction accuracy lags behind that of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This article proposes additional avenues to enhance the utilization of machine learning in the materials science domain. First, to foster the future development of machine learning, it's essential to prioritize rapidly creating a comprehensive material database. Machine learning heavily relies on data, and the quality and quantity of data directly influence its accuracy. Valuable material data, encompassing molecular properties, reaction conditions, and synthetic compositions, are scattered across scientific literature and experimental records. Leveraging text mining can efficiently gather this valuable information from papers, journals, and magazines, significantly expanding existing material databases and creating specialized ones [316]. Second, it is essential to innovate novel machine-learning principles. As time progresses, enhancing deep learning and substituting manual feature engineering will lead to more efficient representations of raw data. However, researchers are still unsure how DNNs choose their features and what those features represent. As a result, the deep learning results are not sufficiently convincing, and no broadly applicable theory is produced. In addition to improving the applicability of machine learning in materials science, trying to comprehend what is happening within the \"black box\" makes it easier to find natural laws that are unknowable to humans [316]. Third, a significant application of machine learning may be in quantum chemistry. Numerous issues in quantum chemistry can be resolved using machine learning thanks to its robust data-processing capabilities. The model's prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by integrating DFT and machine learning. This could be an effective technique for forecasting complex molecular features and architectures, researching quantum multibody systems, and finding novel [355]. Limited material data remains a challenge for machine learning in achieving the desired accuracy for certain tasks. Thus, there's a pressing need for highly accurate models trained on small yet reliable datasets. A deep learning model's adequacy has been demonstrated with as few as 4000 samples [375]. Furthermore, training models using failure data from unsuccessful experiments, as previously described, can be beneficial in such scenarios [376]. One promising approach is high-throughput computational materials design, a burgeoning field in materials science. Researchers employ advanced thermodynamic and electronic-structure techniques, intelligent data mining, and database construction to explore vast data repositories to discover new materials. This review provides a snapshot of this rapidly evolving area, emphasizing the forthcoming challenges and potential opportunities [377]. Computational methods are increasingly vital in materials science research. They play a pivotal role in identifying and enhancing materials for specific purposes, complementing experimental techniques. The in silico materials design field has thrived in the past decade due to exponential increases in processing power, algorithmic progress, and the availability of open-source scientific software [378\u2013380]. More recently, the growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based techniques has created new opportunities for designing and developing materials [381,382]. This Special Issue seeks to gather the latest advancements in computational materials design, showcasing diverse techniques from fundamental computations to molecular dynamics, mesoscale methods, and machine learning-based models for predicting materials properties. The contributions cover a broad spectrum of approaches in this dynamic field [383]. Conclusion Incorporating machine learning into materials research has ushered in a transformative era, fundamentally reshaping how we approach and advance our understanding of materials. Machine learning is a game-changing tool that can quickly analyze complex material properties, predict novel materials, and optimize fabrication processes. Thanks to various machine learning techniques, including unsupervised, supervised, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, computers can learn from data and make wise decisions. This toolkit encourages innovation within industries and pushes the boundaries of materials science. Machine learning significantly impacts various domains, revolutionizing material synthesis through predictive modelling, structure-property correlations, and data-driven exploration. Additionally, it enables precise predictions of material behavior, facilitating customized design and speeding up discovery. The combination of machine learning and image processing improves object detection, classification, and segmentation, revolutionizing the processing of visual information in a variety of industries. Recent developments enable accurate property prediction and data extraction at the atomic level, opening the door for previously unheard-of material insights. Despite its potential, issues with data quality, algorithm complexity, and ethical considerations are acknowledged. Machine learning will be essential in shaping the future of materials research because of its potential to reveal novel insights, speed up material innovation, and overcome obstacles. This thorough analysis highlights the importance of ongoing research and development while highlighting the exciting potential of interdisciplinary collaboration and algorithmic advancements to drive the efficient integration of machine learning and, in turn, chart a dynamic course for the evolution of materials research.

Each year sees the publication of much research on WSN technology and standards, some of which are patented while others are open. These research articles investigate a diverse range of topics. Internet of Things (IoT), a considerable number of internet name servers and online service providers have been the targets of botnet attacks in the most recent months [1]. Some manufacturers of IoTdevices are now voluntarily recalling their whole product lines after having their products infiltrated by botnets. Considering this, it is generally agreed upon that the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSN) need to have a high level of security and trustworthiness [2]. A wireless sensor network, also known as a WSN, is comprised of a network of small sensors that are connected to one another and are dispersed in a pattern that is at random. Sensor networks are distinguished from other kinds of computer networks by a variety of characteristics, including their dense location, random deployment, flexible architecture, limited bandwidth, mobile or motionless sensors, and self-configurable sensor nodes [3]. In today environment, information regarding previously inaccessible areas can be gleaned through the utilisation of various sensors. When this kind of information is transferred, it does not typically go through any changes or become corrupted while it is in transit. Threat actors can get around the security of a WSN in a number of different ways by exploiting the large diversity of vulnerabilities that exist in the system. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected, internet-enabled devices that can share data, draw conclusions about their surroundings based on what they sense, and report their findings to the appropriate node in the system. These devices can do all of these things because they are connected to the internet. These devices may also can make predictions about their surroundings based on what they feel inside their immediate environment. Wearables, healthcare, personal care, agriculture, water crisis management, transportation, and other industries are just some of the places where you can discover Internet of Things smart applications that are already in use [4]. Whether or not a wide variety of security threats may be successfully defended against by the network is determined by whether the security criteria for such applications can be met. One of the most damaging forms of attack that can be carried out on a network that is connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) [5], which is vulnerable to a wide variety of different types of denial of service (DoS) attacks, is jamming. This type of attack can be carried out on any network that is connected to the IoT [6,7]. This attack will result in a decline in the performance of the network since it will disconnect channels and prevent the service from being delivered to users who are authorised to receive it. This will cause the performance of the network to decrease. Smart devices have access to a variety of effective encryption mechanisms, which they can utilise to communicate with one another in a secure manner [8]. Despite this, the current key management tactics for the network are ineffective due to the huge amount of energy they consume, the high amount of computing overhead they produce, and the delay they cause. Encryption and good key management are two examples of the kinds of security measures that are vitally necessary when it comes to protecting the environment from the potentially destructive impacts that could be caused by attempts at intrusion [9]. The hash key-based key management strategy that is provided and this makes use of the multi-hop technique to achieve its goals. It is a commonly held belief that the most trustworthy kind of protection for modern wireless networks is provided by security measures that are based on hashes. Cluster-based methods are currently being utilised in the construction of many sensor networks. This is largely being done to improve the energy efficiency as well as the scalability of the system [10]. Within the scope of this investigation, we devise a method of key management that has a low overhead and makes effective use of both the available storage space and the available CPU cycles. This work develops a lightweight key management protocol (LKMP) that involves reduced memory consumption and processing power. After running the simulation through a network simulator, the results are analyzed and compared to the most recent and cutting-edge models that are currently accessible. The findings of the simulation indicate that the proposed method offers improvements over its forerunners in terms of throughput, security, and resilience. 2 Related works This section discusses about the current key management strategy for the cluster-based sensor network, which makes use of secret keys that are produced from a hash function. These keys are kept secret to maintain the network security. A key distribution method for wireless sensor networks that combines a hash chain with deployment knowledge was proposed in Ref. [11] the work that you have done (DKH-KD). To accomplish this, it first determined the total number of hash chains and then generated a pairwise key based on the results of that calculation. To determine the pairwise key, we made use of the values that were produced by a chain of reverse hashes. Due to this, establishing a paired key can be done more quickly and easily, but as a result, the cost of computation can increase due to the process of rekeying. Ehdai et al. [12] presented a method that is based on a 2D hash, and in this technique, the author used two separate hash functions to solve flaws in the security of sensor networks and effectively protect nodes from being seized. The operation ends up reducing the amount of energy that is utilised by a significant margin, but the rekeying process ends up increasing the amount of computing overhead. Jia et al. [13] developed an efficient and lightweight authentication and key management strategy as a means of minimising the required amount of computing expense to produce keys. This computational burden presented itself as a direct consequence of an increase in the number of malicious nodes residing inside the sensor network. The sensor network was plagued by an increase in the number of malicious nodes. The network security has been strengthened, and the amount of work that needs to be done to resolve problems has been cut down significantly. Priyanka et al. [14] provided a technique to key management for wireless sensor networks that was extremely secure and was based on an attack model. The purpose of this method is to build a hash chain to prevent a node capture attack from taking place. Each node in the network contributes to the hash chain by establishing the most fundamental level of security that it thinks is adequate for itself. The first step in calculating the proper level of protection for each cell is to calculate the risk that a cell may be compromised in some way. The solution that was proposed makes a considerable improvement to the network level of security; however, this comes at the expense of an increase in the computational cost, as it calls for a significant number of rekeying processes to be carried out. Ahlawat et al. [15] proposed a hybrid approach for path vulnerability matrices on random key pre-distribution (RKP) for wireless sensor networks to cut down on energy consumption and the possibility of a node capture attempt. This was done to protect the networks from potential intruders trying to take control of the nodes. Mehmood et al. [16] presented a scheme for rekeying and session key agreement in WBAN. The main contribution of this approach has been deployed in both heterogonous and homogenous WSN. A mathematical model validation of this technique, however, will result in better secure model. Ali et al. [17] suggested a WSN cryptography system based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Secure and efficient key generation is achieved by the modified Diffie-Hellman method, which protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. The security operation, key generation, computation time for different data packets, and effective outcomes are all evaluated for this method. However, the proposed method takes a long time to process data responses. These approaches are unable to scale well with a big network since they rely on just one hop to establish the secure connection that needs to be made between sensor nodes. In addition to this, they are not appropriate for use in real-time settings, which renders them inappropriate for usage in any context whatsoever. They are not scalable, and as a result, they are unable to adapt to a dynamic environment that supports mobility characteristics. Consequently, they are unable to support mobility characteristics. In addition, the efficiency of the job that has been completed is not examined in connection with the effect that the attack has had. Both represent significant shortcomings in the previously discussed bodies of work. The constraints caused by the key management approaches that were utilised in the previous work can be avoided by using the proposed research to conduct the investigation. This is performed by determining how well the attack scales in response to the presence of an increasing number of hostile nodes within the network. According to the results of the evaluation, the performance of the network has significantly improved thanks to a reduction in the amount of energy used, the amount of computational cost, and the amount of packet loss. 3 Network model In this section a flat architecture is utilised, all the sensor nodes communicate with one another and share the same resources, including those pertaining to processing, power, and communication. The hierarchical WSN, on the other hand, is composed of a base station (BS) or mobile sink (MS), cluster heads (CHs), and sensor nodes, all of which are organised in a hierarchical structure according to their respective capabilities. The most powerful node in the network is known as the base station. Other nodes in the network are less powerful. The capabilities of storage, transmission, and processing that are made available by CHs are far more advanced as compared to those supplied by sensor nodes, which make up the lowest level of the hierarchy. According to the research presented in Ref. [6], the performance of hierarchical WSNs is superior to that of flat networks in terms of the amount of communication overhead that is experienced as well as the network ability to scale in large-scale contexts. The structure of the methodology that we have proposed is comparable to that of hierarchical WSNs. The WSN is organised in a hierarchical fashion, with individual components being held accountable for a specific set of obligations. Each cluster contains its own CH, which is responsible for providing services to the many sensor nodes that are situated within that cluster. Every sensor node has a dialogue with the CH responsible for its specific zone. The CH will first perform any necessary processing, then compile the data, and then send it to the base station for transmission. The hierarchical method, which can be applied in a wide range of different sorts of systems due to the fact that it can be used with a number of distinct types of sensors, has been widely adopted. The many different forms of data that can be collected by sensors in a military setting can be use in a broad variety of different ways. Detection of invasions, detection of chemical and biological hazards, and detection of objects in the environment are a few examples of these applications. Another approach to categorise the sensors is according to the physical features that they have, such as the presence of motion sensors, heat sensors, pressure sensors, and chemical sensors. According to the conceptualization of the network, it is the task of the KGC to generate tokens and many other keying materials that the other nodes can use. Tokens are sent from the key generation centre (KGC), which is placed at the base station level, down to the cell hubs (CHs), and then lastly to the sensor nodes. 4 Proposed method When individual nodes in a cluster-based wireless sensor network relocate to a new site, the key management problem for the network becomes an immediate concern. Because of the mobility of the sensor nodes, there is a constant change in the topology of the network. This raises the likelihood that there will be security vulnerabilities in the wireless sensor network. The pre-distribution of a random key is incorporated into our system, and the multi-hop distance-based approach that we have devised is the strategy that we have chosen to adopt to accomplish this goal. This improves energy efficiency and cuts down on the possibility of data packets being lost. 4.1 Key establishment This phase is referred to as phase 1, and it is utilised to produce keys for each individual node that is a component of a cluster. Initial key Ki has already been transmitted to each one of the nodes. Once the primary key, denoted by Ki, has been identified, the master key, denoted by Km, can be produced by combining Ki with a one-way hash function f. After the creation of the primary key, this step can then be taken (hx). A request for a paired key will be sent from Node SNi, which will utilise its master key, Km, to send it to Neighbouring Node SNj. The request will be delivered to the node SNj that is located nearby. After that, the message will be distributed over the network to each node that is a component of it. After the request has been received by the node SNj, the transmission of the pairwise key Kpair to the node SNi will immediately get under way. The pairwise key is produced because of this procedure between any two nodes in the network, regardless of the number of hops that separate those nodes from one another during their communication with one another. In this instance, the value of the likelihood that has been altered in some way is applied to the computation of the constant length of the hash chain. The hash chain, also known as hc, is created with the help of a hashing algorithm that only works in one direction. After applying hc to Ki, the value of the domain key K1 could potentially be increased by an additional I if this is required. Now, the hash function will do its thing and produce n keys, of which at least one will be a part of each cluster. This is how it works. Every cluster chi will have extensive data pertaining to all the cluster nodes. 4.2 Pairwise key establishment The node A will be able to receive the paired key that is necessary to communicate with the target node B once the generation of the master key Km has been completed. Let pretend that node A is trying to establish covert communication with node B by using a paired key Kpair as a means of doing so. Let also make believe that node B is the one who is receiving this covert communication. After the hash chain HC that was established has been finished being created, a pairwise key will be distributed to each node in the cluster. The following paragraphs detail the procedures that must be completed to generate a pairwise key: For A \u2192 hxa (hya(ki)) For B \u2192 hxb (hyb(ki)) To produce the pairwise key for node A, the following procedures need to be carried out in order: hxa (hya(ki)) is assigned to node A when Xa < Xb and Xa \u2264 Xb hxb (hyb(ki)) is assigned to node B when Xa \u2265 Xb and Xa \u2265 Xb 4.3 Key management This takes place before the sensors are even connected to the network, entails the production and activation of the master key Km. This step is performed before the sensors are even connected to the network. The pre-distribution of keys, which is what makes network security possible, is described in its entirety in Phase 2. Developing a safe connection that can go through a certain number of relays is the objective of the Phase 3 protocol. As part of the first phase, which is referred to as key distribution, the first key, Ki, is generated and pre-distributed to all the nodes in the network before any attempt is made to deploy the network. Amaster key Km will be established at each node SNi by utilising the secret key Ki and the one-way hash algorithm Kh. This process will take place after the previous step has been completed. To ensure that the network is protected, this step will be taken. In the following, the generation of the master key falls under the purview of sensor node n. (1) Km = f(Ki(SNI Di)) After the first stage of the production of the master key, SNi will send an advertisement message to its neighbouring node SNn to communicate its identification data to that node. It will wait for SNn to respond before moving on to the next step in the process. The data is sent to the neighbour node SNn, which then processes it and sends a response to the initial node SNi that includes its own identification data. After that, the process repeats. The master keys Km and Kn are combined with the subkeys SNi and SNn, respectively, to generate a pairwise key that consists of both master keys. The nodes will begin by constructing a pairwise key with their neighbours that are located within one hop from them, and then they will move on to constructing a pairwise key with their neighbours that are located further away from them in the network. The following is how the pairwise key will be computed if the source node is SNi and the target node is SNn in terms of the multihop distance: (2) K = fKiKj, Kk \u2026 Kn-1(IDn) 4.4 Authentication If the network needs to add a new node, we will utilise mutual authentication as our method of authentication. If Node A needs to join the network, it will send an authorization request (Auth-Req) to the BS. The BS will then issue a second Auth-Res message that will be encrypted utilising the node A public key once the verification process to ensure that node A is who it claims to have been successfully completed. This will result in the response code ACK1 being triggered. The BS will gain knowledge of the public key, encryption method, and protocol that are associated with the node that was requested while the verification process is being carried out. It is necessary for the node to periodically transmit a Hello signal to re-establish its presence in the network after it has been validated. A particular node in the network will be removed from the network after a predetermined amount of time has elapsed and the BS has not received any data from that node. When a node at a multihop distance makes a connection request that is greater than the transmission limit, there will be a round of mutual authentication that takes place. An authenticating server absolutely needs to have a direct connection to the base station (BS) of the node that is requesting to join the network. In a multi-hop arrangement, Node B will first send an Auth-Req to BS before establishing any kind of connection with Node A. This is Node A is unable to authenticate itself on behalf of BS. Because of this, Node A is unable to authenticate itself on behalf of BS. It performs authentication, activates ACK2, selects the appropriate method and protocols, and encrypts the response message using node A public key before sending it to node B in the form of an Auth-Res message. All of this is carried out after it has been given the request. 4.5 Routing protocol A method of routing that considers energy efficiency is being implemented. To select the path that will lead from the source node to the sink node in the most effective manner, the steps that are detailed below need to be carried out. \u2022 To begin the process of correcting the next hop, you must first locate the sink node in the cluster. Only then can you move on to the rest of the process. You are required to make the next hop also a sink node if the sink node can be accessed successfully. \u2022 Determine the path that will get you to the destination node in the cluster that is the most time and resource effective if you query each node in the cluster. \u2022 It is recommended that the signal strength and the distance be taken into consideration when selecting the next hop in the chain. \u2022 During the first stage, when all the nodes are exchanging information with the CH node, the request-reply packet is used to calculate the distance that separates them from one another. \u2022 The node that is the next hop node is the one that has the strongest signal strength and is located at the shortest distance from the destination. After the network has been broken up into clusters, the inter-cluster structure will be arranged in a way that considers the reasons the network was developed in the first place. The leaders of the various clusters can communicate with one another or with the base station by way of a chain of intermediate nodes to combine their resources and share information with one another. The transmission range between cluster heads is a configurable parameter that can be adjusted to guarantee a specific level of connectivity while minimising interference when using multi-hop communication among the cluster heads. This modification can be carried out to ensure that the least possible amount of interference is encountered. The definition of connection that is used for inter-cluster communication is based on the multi-hop structure of the network as well as the correlation between the inter-cluster transmission range R, the intra-cluster transmission range r, and the node density. This definition is used when discussing the process of communication between different clusters. However, it is the fact that the theoretical value for connectivity may not be appropriate for a real-time application, namely that the inappropriate inter-cluster range for inter-cluster communication is another inefficient use of energy. The study refers to the fact that the distance between clusters ought not to exceed a few hundred metres in any direction. Let consider the common example of a sensor network. According to the calculations regarding connectivity that were presented earlier, it is proposed that a radio range of 180 m be used for inter-cluster communication. If this were to be done, it would make it possible to create a link that is nearly on par with the direct connection that already exists between all the cluster heads and the base station. We will refer to the range of transmission that takes place between clusters for the purposes of this investigation, where r will stand for the range of transmission that takes place within each cluster. Assuming that the network is dense, we are aware that most cluster heads will serve as nodes in the component of the graph containing cluster heads that has the most heavily connected edges. The study explains the correlation that exists between the value of R, the transmission range between clusters, and the number of edges in a graph that are fully linked. When the clustering procedure has been successfully concluded, the cluster leaders will send Weight messages to all the nodes that are located within a specified radius R. In these messages, the node ID and weight W are both included. When one cluster head receives a weight message from another cluster head, the first thing that it does is compare its own weight to that of its neighbours. This is done to determine whether it has gained or lost weight. If it is not as powerful as its parent node, it will select the parent node that carries the most weight and send an acknowledgement message to the parent node that carries the most weight if it is not as powerful as its parent node. A routing tree will be constructed with a root node that has the largest weight among all cluster heads in the same independent connected component. This node will serve as the starting point for the tree construction. After a predetermined amount of time has passed, this occurrence is going to take place. Once the construction of the routing tree is finished, the cluster heads will distribute a TDMA schedule to all the active nodes in the cluster so that those nodes can start the process of data collection. This will take place after the completion of the routing tree construction. 5 Results and discussions Last Node Dies refers to the moment when the very last node in the network succumbs to its illness and passes away. Both times are utilised in simulation studies to ascertain the lifetime of a network. The time that the first node in the network passes away is referred as the First Node Die (FND) Time. Each of the results of the simulations that are reported here is, unless otherwise specified, the mean of 200 individual tests that were performed using the same group of sensor nodes. These tests were carried out to obtain accurate results. During the simulation, we only calculate the amount of energy that is used by a sensor node radio transmitter, radio amplifier, and data fusion unit. For determining how efficiently the radio hardware dissipates energy, we make use of the same radio model that was employed during the simulation which is shown in Figs. 1\u20133 . The findings of the simulation indicate that the method that was proposed improves the performance of the network by lowering the amount of money spent on computing, the amount of energy used, the amount of delay time, and the number of lost packets. It was discovered that performance had decreased after a method for single-hop key management was put into action, and this was the case after it was discovered. A significant increase in the number of retransmissions that need to take place because of an attack is required due to the use of a design that only requires one hop, which raises the rate at which packets are lost during an attack. The provision of a single hop key for the establishment of connections with neighbouring nodes and a multi hop key for communicating with a multi hop node is included in the proposed integrated solution for reducing the rate of packet loss and cutting down on the amount of energy that is consumed. This is one of the ways that the energy consumption can be reduced. The use of a one-way hash function enables a reduction in the quantity of processing resources that are necessary for the process of key generation. Using the paired key to assist in the calculation of a one-way hash function Through the use of Ki, we can identify which node in the network is malicious. By utilising the method for key validation, CH will have the ability to ascertain which node in the network is acting in a malicious manner. Each sensor node in the network will be equipped with a verifier, and CHi will see to it that it is kept in the most recent version possible. The results of each key check that is carried out on an individual packet are validated and recorded by the verifier function. If the verification fails for a predetermined number of times, CHi will dispose of the packet. Following that, the malicious node will be removed from the network in a relatively reduced amount of time. 6 Conclusions Within the scope of this investigation, we devise a method of key management that has a low overhead and makes effective use of both the available storage space and the available CPU cycles. This approach to key management in the WSN makes use of an unsupervised learning mechanism and an algorithm for machine learning to accomplish its goals. After running the simulation through a network simulator, the results are analyzed and compared to the most recent and cutting-edge models that are currently accessible. According to the findings of the simulation, the model that was proposed not only offers a higher level of safety and in terms of the amount of energy it uses about 222 J, how efficiently it stores data, and how well it connects to networks. Our long-term goal is to include several of the most cutting-edge security techniques into WSN and IoT application research. The accuracy of their analysis relative to current practises can be shown. In addition, a mathematical model may have been used to analyse the suggested strategy. The efficiency of this system for ensuring the safety of WSN and associated domains can be evaluated by testing it with a variety of novel parameters.

A patient who could be saved is mistakenly assessed, due to a false positive, as having a \u201cVery low possibility to survive\u201d. Such a prognosis can inform the decision to withdraw treatment. As a result, the initial prediction \u201cVery low possibility to survive\u201d is self-realized, thereby showing as a true positive. If this faulty and biased data is utilized to develop or improve the ML models, it reproduces and amplifies the false positive predictions. This leads to further harm in that more viable patients lose the opportunity to be treated. If this new data gets used in its turn to further develop the model, it leads to a vicious cycle of harm.

Keywords Prediction model Natural language processing Heterogeneity Self-fulfilling prophecy Feedback loop Large language model Emergency medicine Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) are important areas of computer science that have recently attracted attention for their combined application to medicine. AI refers to technology in which computer systems have the ability to think and learn like humans and to automatically perform tasks that humans would normally perform such as cognition driven decision-making. 1 ML is used to develop algorithms and models that can learn from and make predictions or recommend decisions based on large datasets. 1 In resuscitation medicine, AI and ML hold the potential to revolutionize patient care by providing decision support and optimizing treatment strategies. However, as techniques continue to advance and become more complex, it is increasingly challenging for clinicians to stay abreast of the latest research involving AI and ML techniques in the resuscitation field. This review aims to introduce recent AI and ML research to healthcare professionals interested in applying ML to resuscitation research but who are not experts in the field. We reviewed the relevant literatures searched as described in the Supplementary file to introduce prediction models, natural language processing (including large language models, LLM), consideration of treatment heterogeneity, and optimization of medical practice and resource management by reinforcement learning. We also discuss the limitations and challenges of implementing AI and ML tools in actual clinical settings. We aim to facilitate discussion on the potential for further research and enhance communication between clinicians, resuscitation researchers and AI and ML experts. Prediction models The most common use of ML is predictive modeling. 1 Prediction models (also known as supervised learning) are commonly used to predict a patient\u2019s diagnosis or outcomes based on clinical data. For example, ML models can be helpful to diagnose, estimate the severity in triage, and understand the risk of complications in decision-making for surgery, which can allow us to develop more appropriate treatment plans and potentially improve patient prognosis in a more objective manner. 2\u20134 This type of prediction model may also be applied to adjust for severity when considering the quality of care and assuming the counterfactual scenario (such as if a certain treatment was not performed with the resulting outcome) when discussing causal inference. 5,6 Prediction models may incorporate a wide array of data including structured data such as demographic information, clinical variables, biomarkers, and blood test results, and also unstructured data such as images and bio-signals like electrocardiograms (EEG) and electroencephalograms (EEG), to predict outcomes (Fig. 1 ). We introduce some examples of research on prediction models based on the type of data. Prediction models using structured data Structured data is one of the most common sources of data for ML models in resuscitation research. 7,8 This type of data is typically presented in a tabular format with clear rows and columns, representing patients and their respective features or attributes. These may include demographic information, medical history, vital signs, laboratory test results, and more. For out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) research, the Utstein format is established worldwide as a standardized data format. This enables us to easily develop ML models applied to the data. 9,10 One of the primary uses of ML with tabular data in resuscitation research are predictive models to estimate the likelihood of outcomes such as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival, or neurological recovery after cardiac arrest. 7,8,11 In another example, tabular data was also used to develop early warning systems (EWS) that predict the risk of cardiac arrest or other serious adverse events among patients admitted to hospital. 12\u201314 These systems use ML models to analyze various data such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and laboratory data, to identify patterns that may suggest a patient's condition is deteriorating. As a result, EWS can alert healthcare providers to intervene before a cardiac arrest occurs. 14 Further, these predictions are also valuable to estimate demand for bed capacity and to appropriately allocate medical resources. 15 Some of these ML models are implemented in electronic medical record systems or as applications on tablets or smartphones, which automatically input the data into the model and output the calculated results, improving user availability and accessibility. 14,15 Prediction models using unstructured data Images and bio-signals (EEG, and ECG) ML has been increasingly utilized in resuscitation research to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in unstructured data such as various imaging modalities, including CT scans, EEG, and ECG. For example, there are some researchers developing ML models to predict neurological outcomes using head CT images 16\u201318 and EEG, 19\u201321 potentially leading to more accurate and timely diagnoses. Similarly, ML models have been employed to analyze ECG data, enabling the prediction of critical events such as in-hospital cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, and the success of defibrillation during resuscitation. 22\u201326 These applications of ML models using medical imaging and bio-signals are expected to contribute to facilitating early detection, improving predictive accuracy, and ultimately enhancing more appropriate resuscitation, emergency, or intensive care. Exploring sub-phenotypes and treatment heterogeneity ML is also used to explore sub-phenotypes, an emerging concept in precision medicine. (Fig. 2 ) Sub-phenotypes are distinct subgroups within a disease or condition characterized by different clinical features such as disease progression, outcomes, and underlying biological mechanisms. 27,28 Whereas phenotypes represent categories of patients with common features such as a specific syndrome, e.g., sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, 27,28 sub-phenotype is particularly relevant when discussing subgroups with heterogeneity on treatment effect. 27 Heterogeneity on treatment effect refers to the variation in how different individuals or groups respond to the same treatment. 5 It means that not all patients respond to treatments in the same way due to various factors such as genetic differences, lifestyle factors, pre-existing health conditions, and more. 5 Understanding the concept of sub-phenotypes and the complexities of treatment effect heterogeneity are anticipated to advance the development of personalized medicine, moving beyond the conventional 'one-size-fits-all' treatment approach. For example, some research in the resuscitation context suggests the hypothesis that sub-phenotypes exhibit heterogeneity of effect of targeted temperature management, such as some subgroups may have the potential benefit of hypothermia (e.g., at 33 \u2103), while others may not. 29,30 For exploring such treatment heterogeneity, ML such as \u201cclustering\u201d or \u201ccausal machine learning\u201d are utilized in some research. 31,32 Clustering Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning that can be used to identify subgroups who share similar clinical characteristics and explore treatment heterogeneity or novel association between the subgroups and events, using data such as patients\u2019 characteristics, biomarker values, and genomic data (Fig. 2). 31,33 One of the strengths of clustering is its ability to manage data complexity and discover hidden patterns, making the data easier to understand and visualize. Previously, this clustering analysis was used in research exploring novel sub-phenotypes among patients with various patterns in emergency medicine and critical care such as sepsis, ARDS, trauma, and cardiac arrest. 27,28,34\u201339 For instance, various clinical patterns in coagulopathy among patients with severe head trauma are associated with different outcomes. 38 There are also subgroups among OHCA patients with different clinical outcomes when treated with ECPR. 39 Some research suggests the effect of early goal-directed treatment or the effect of drugs on coagulopathy are different among subgroups in sepsis. 36,37 This technique is also utilized to summarize the risk factors as a subgroup. One example is the subgroups with environmental features characterized by environmental parameters such as temperature, wind speed, and air pollution are suggested to be associated with the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction or acute ischemic stroke. 40,41 Causal machine learning Causal machine learning is an ML approach to investigate causal inference, which is particularly valuable in assessing heterogeneity in treatment effects (Fig. 3 ). 5,42,43 Causal forest, one approach within causal machine learning based on the random forest, works by splitting the data into different subgroups and assessing the treatment effect within each subgroup by handling the no-linear and/or hi-dimensional data. 5,42,43 For example in critical care fields, the causal forest was used on data from an RCT about the effect of using a bougie during intubation. 44 This RCT found that using a bougie did not increase the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt in all critically ill adults; however, the causal forest analysis suggested some individuals who had the potential benefit of using a bougie. The application of machine learning using genetic and molecular data (omics data) to treatment heterogeneity and precision medicine is also expected to result in a more personalized approach to healthcare such as investigating the heterogeneity of the treatment response or adverse events of drugs among patients with certain genetic features. 45,46 Although this type of research is mainly focused on the oncology field because the drugs are commonly targeted to specific genetic features, 47,48 there will be an increasing number of studies on treatment heterogeneity and pharmacogenomics in the resuscitation field. Reinforcement learning to optimize treatment Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that autonomously chooses actions to maximize rewards obtained from the given environment. The system learns through trial and error to select actions that lead to the highest possible reward. Reinforcement learning has broad applications and is particularly useful for complex tasks, such as games, autonomous driving, robotics, and logistics. 49 For example, in 2015, AlphaGo, an AI developed using reinforcement learning, famously defeated a world champion Go player. 50 In the field of medicine and healthcare, reinforcement learning has potential applications in optimizing treatment strategies. (Fig. 4 ) For example, one notable example of using reinforcement learning, in the context of intensive care, is the development of an \u201cAI Clinician\u201c for sepsis treatment in managing fluids and vasopressors. 51 This AI system analyzed two ICU databases and learned optimal treatment strategies by examining numerous treatment decisions to maximize the expected survival outcome. As a result, this AI model could select the optimal treatment strategy which showed the lowest mortality rates. Another model using reinforcement learning suggested personalized optimization of mechanical ventilation in patients staying at cardiovascular ICUs. 52 In other examples, some reinforcement learning programs were suggested to investigate the optimal dose of sedative agents in general anesthesia. 53 Although there are few published research using reinforcement learning in the resuscitation field, it has potential for future studies. Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of ML technology that enables computers to analyze the language that humans usually use in daily life. This technology is prevalent in our modern lives with applications using voice recognition such as voice assistant programs like Apple\u2019s Siri or Google Assistant and using text like chatbots or language translation tools. In the field of research in resuscitation, NLP models are being utilized in innovative ways. One notable example of using voice data is ML programs to help recognize cardiac arrest and support initiating bystander-CPR during emergency calls to the dispatch center (Fig. 5 ). 54,55 These programs can analyze the caller\u2019s words during an emergency call and estimate the probability of the patient being in cardiac arrest. This kind of program has also been applied in research to detect other emergencies such as severe trauma after road trauma and stroke. 56,57 Additionally, NLP voice recognition technology offers practical benefits for paramedics in the field. Paramedics can use voice commands to create prehospital records thereby reducing the need for manual data entry and enabling them to focus more on patient care. 58 These programs have the potential to enable faster and more accurate deployment of emergency medical services, which can improve patient outcomes. NLP technology can also be utilized to analyze clinical data from the free text in medical records such as medical history or physical findings. 59 Algorithms can be developed to predict emergency conditions such as in-hospital cardiac arrest or give decision support on the appropriate disposition of patients at the emergency department. 59\u201363 This technique can also be used to accurately predict neurological outcomes such as a modified Rankin scale by analyzing free text data in clinical notes. 64 Additionally, chatbot tools using NLP have also been developed in the resuscitation research fields. One example is a preliminary chatbot to guide users on how to perform bystander CPR. 62 In summary, NLP-applied research using voice or text is increasing and they can analyze communication or medical records to predict events and be a guide to action in resuscitation. Large language model (LLM) is one domain of research in NLP fields that can understand and generate natural language used by humans. Typically, by learning patterns from large amounts of textual data, these models can generate answers to new questions, or produce text to accomplish specific tasks such as translation or revising the text. Recently, the GPT-3 and GPT-4 developed by OpenAI have attracted a lot of attention for their wide adaptability and flexibility. 65 If you enter the prompt \u201cWhat should we do if we encounter a patient who has suddenly collapsed?\u201d into the application, the application can provide plausible answers as if they are provided by a healthcare professional. (However, it should be noted that these answers may be incorrect.) One representative example of using LLM is that the LLM can pass the medical licensing examination without any additional training data. 66,67 Further, some research indicated that LLM can provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions. 68,69 Further, the LLM is also expected to summarize the clinical information from medical records like a professional or perform the systematic review instead of humans. 70,71 Although research in the resuscitation field has not yet been published, it is expected to develop in the future. In contrast, this LLM has also caused various controversial issues, such as the accuracy, validity, and responsibility of the generated sentences and ethical issues that may arise (more detail is discussed in the next paragraph). 65 Although several concerns, LLM has great potential to improve the burden on healthcare providers, especially in terms of decision-making, documentation, and summarizing medical information. Challenges for AI and ML in resuscitation research and implementation Despite the extensive research conducted, actual implementation of AI and ML in the clinical setting remains limited, though some practices have implemented AI and ML-based algorithms in resuscitation and intensive care. 14,15,54,72,73 Widespread adoption may be slow due to several concerns and limitations. 74 Here we give an overview of the most important challenges and barriers that prevent proper implementation. Data quality and availability AI and ML algorithms heavily depend on the quality of data they are trained on. If the data is unreliable, missing, incomplete, or biased, the model's predictions or performance can be inaccurate or even harmful. A prediction model may simply be biased because of the original data it is trained on, reflecting the existing bias as is. For example, an AI model may reflect historical disparities in healthcare access and outcomes, and inadvertently perpetuate these biases by recommending differential treatment based on factors such as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. 75,76 It is therefore essential that the training data is diverse and representative of the patient population. However, in the actual scene of resuscitation, obtaining comprehensive and diverse datasets can be challenging. Clinical situations can change drastically in a short time, making it difficult to comprehensively collect data in a timely manner, such as in a resource-limited environment like the prehospital setting or a crowded emergency department. 77,78 Furthermore, in many settings of resuscitation, clinical data is still being recorded using paper and pen, and some backend data entry process is needed to integrate the data into electronic medical records for it to be utilized for ML application. 79 Yet, ensuring the availability of comprehensive and representative data is crucial to develop accurate and generalizable models. Validation process to verify the reproducibility Once ML models have been developed, they should be reproducable. 80 Previously, it has been reported that many prediction models have a high risk of bias, especially due to the lack of the validation process to confirm the reproducibility of the models using different datasets. 80\u201383 One of the problems to validate the ML and AI models using different datasets is the difficulty in obtaining different data from the original data with consistent format and definition of the variables. In the resuscitation fields, the Utstein format is broadly accepted as a universal data-collecting standard mainly in pre-hospital settings; however, some of the in-hospital data have not yet been standardized (e.g., some variables in the emergency department or intensive care unit have still not been strictly defined). 10 Another concern is inappropriate reporting of the originally developed models. 83 Reproducibility can be difficult to ascertain as details of the models are not reported. 83 Furthermore, validation study risks selective reporting bias, meaning that validation studies reporting models with poor performance are less likely to get published. 81 Yet, ensuring robustness in AI and ML models, including their reliability and reproducibility, is essential to prevent or minimize unintended harm. Generalizability and clinical integration Verifying the Generalizability is also essential to validate the AI and ML models prior to clinical application. Again, ML models depend on data, and if the model too strongly fits certain features of the data (\u201coverfitting\u201d), the results may not be generalizable to the different population without those features. Resuscitation practices vary across different healthcare settings, geopolitical contexts, and patient populations. 84\u201387 AI models developed in one context may not generalize well when traveling to other settings. Ensuring the generalizability and applicability the models to diverse populations, different clinical protocols and resource-constrained environments is essential for their widespread application. 87 Additionally, other practical barriers exist to implementing AI and ML in clinical settings. It includes not only regulatory approval but also integration into clinical workflows. Moreover, the adoption of ML models necessitates clear benefits in routine clinical practice, such as improving patients\u2019 outcomes and reducing workload or costs. However, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the actual benefit of ML models in clinical settings. 42,80 If integration of ML models into general clinical workflows does not yield clear benefits for clinicians, patients, or other stakeholders, no one would use these models. The actual benefit of ML tools in clinical settings compared to existing clinical workflows need to be demonstrated in research before widespread adoption will follow. Self-fulfilling prophecies and feedback loops Another important issue to be focused on in the resuscitation field is the risk of hidden false positive bias by self-fulfilling prophecy and feedback loop when predicting the prognosis of cardiac arrest patients. 88,89 A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that influences people\u2019s beliefs and behavior through which the prediction is then realized. 90 In resuscitation, if clinicians expect that a particular patient may not survive despite the best treatment, the expectation could influence their decision to forego further treatment, allowing the patient\u2019s death, thereby fulfilling the initial prediction (self-fulfilling prophecy). This becomes especially problematic if the initial prediction was incorrect (a false-positive), which could result in the patient not receiving the potentially beneficial care. While these issues have existed even before AI and ML are developed (because predictions of clinicians are sometimes inaccurate), 91 there is growing concern that AI and ML might amplify the bias due to self-fulfilling feedback loops (Fig. 6 ). If a model trained on biased data is applied to guide clinical decision-making, and the new data influenced by the model's results are then used as input data again to \u201cimprove\u201d the model, there is a risk that the initial biases will be reinforced and amplified. To illustrate, if a prediction model is developed using data from a hospital where resuscitation efforts were consistently terminated early for OHCA patients aged over 70 years old during a specific period due to temporary limitation of resources (such as limitation of intensive care during the COVID-19 pandemic), the model may inevitably predict the lower probability of survival for similar patients than is accurate. This prediction merely reflects the flawed input data itself rather than the truth under ideal circumstances. Yet, if clinicians perceive this prediction as \u201caccurate\u201d and terminate resuscitation efforts based on such false positives, no one will notice the missed opportunities for successful resuscitation of OHCA patients over 70 years, since the outcome confirms the prediction. 88 If new models are then trained based on the confirmed biased data, it can further amplify the biased prediction and inappropriate withdrawal rates. In essence, past mistakes lead to new self-fulfilling prophecies, reinforcing predictions that generate inappropriate clinical judgments, creating a vicious cycle; an automated feedback loop of self-fulfilling poor outcomes for future cardiac arrest patients. 88 Furthermore, the lack of error signals due to confirmative outcomes combined with the lack of interpretability of ML models greatly hinders clinicians from recognizing such biased predictive feedback loops. Catching false positives retrospectively is near to impossible, since this would require counterfactual data. Clinical guidelines suggest the need for a multi-modal approach to predict the outcome of cardiac arrest patients to minimize the potential harm of false-positive of predictions. 92 When advanced AI models are developed, clinicians must remain aware of the risk for amplified bias through self-fulfilling prophecies and feedback loops. Transparency, Interpretability, and trust A key challenge when applying AI and ML to the actual resuscitation scene is the interpretability of and trust in ML models. 80\u201382 ML models are often described as a 'black box' due to the complexity of the models that generate the results. This lack of transparency can hinder clinicians\u2019 or patients\u2019 trust towards ML models. One example is, as mentioned above, an ML model was developed to detect potential cardiac arrest cases using the voice data of emergency calls at the dispatch center. 54 The retrospective observational study using the voice recordings indicated that the ML model outperformed human dispatchers. 77 However, the RCT comparing the dispatcher assisted by the ML model to those without such assistance, did not demonstrate any improvement in the performance to recognize the cardiac arrest cases. 54 One of the potential mechanisms of this result suggested by the research team was that the dispatcher could not understand the ML model\u2019s decision-making process and the dispatcher possibly did not trust the alert from the ML program. 93 Had the advice come from human experts instead of the ML model, the dispatchers might have asked the rationale why and how they concluded, considered accepting (or rejecting) their suggestion, and thereby improved their performance to recognize the cardiac arrest case. As such, achieving interpretability and trust in ML models may be essential to successfully implement AI and ML into real-world clinical practice. Regulatory and legal challenges While proper data collection and management is an essential prerequisite for developing and applying ML models to clinical settings, such data collection and management must of course respect privacy and comply with the law. 94 Furthermore, liability and responsibility frameworks need to be developed and implemented for AI-driven and ML-based resuscitation interventions, in order to ensure accountability and patient safety. As seen in this article, AI and ML can raise several ethical concerns when it is applied to the actual medical system and care, although the ethical concerns far exceed the ones we mention here. Generally speaking, the Ethics Guideline for Trustworthy AI suggested seven key requirements including human agency and oversight, technical robustness and safety, privacy and data governance, transparency, diversity, non-discrimination and fairness, environmental and societal well-being, and, accountability. 94 While we have selected several significant issues particular to resuscitation, these ethical principles should be addressed across all AI applications in medicine, regardless of the specialty. Indeed, many non-profit institutions, regulatory, and governmental bodies across the world are currently collaborating to ensure (inter)national laws that better protect citizens from the rapidly increasing impacts of AI and ML-driven models. Conclusion In this article, we introduce and illustrate important concepts within AI and ML research in the resuscitation field. The application of AI and ML in resuscitation research holds significant potential to revolutionize the field by improving prediction, supporting decision-making, and developing personalized treatment strategies. However, various limitations and ethical concerns must be addressed to ensure the responsible and effective implementation of these technologies in actual clinical practice. As more high-quality data becomes available, it is expected that AI-driven models and ML-based algorithms will play an increasingly important role in resuscitation research and practice. Moving forward, it will be essential for researchers, computer scientists, clinicians, ethicists, policymakers, and other stakeholders to work together to overcome the challenges and harness the full potential of AI and ML in resuscitation, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare systems.

Key aroma components of 33 fragrant peanut oils with different aroma types were screened by combined using flavoromics and machine learning. A total of 108 volatile compounds were identified and 100 kinds of them were accurately quantified, and 38 compounds out of them were with odorant activity value \u22651. The 33 peanut oils presented varied intensity of \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019, \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018peanut butter-like\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019, and could be classified into four aroma types, namely raw, light, thick and salty. Partial least squares regression analysis, random forest and classification regression tree revealed that 2-acetyl pyrazine had a negative effect on \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 and could distinguish raw flavor samples well; 2-methylbutanal and 4-vinylguaiacol were key compounds of \u2018roasted nut\u2019 and had significant differences (P < 0.0001) in thick and raw flavor samples; furfural contributed to the \u2018puffed food\u2019 as well as key compound of salty flavor. Keywords Peanut oil Key aroma compounds Sensory characteristic Flavoromics Machine learning Data availability Data will be made available on request. Introduction Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important oilseed for edible purposes with high oil content up to 50%. From 2020 to 2021, the annual production of peanut oil was 6.49 million tons, ranking sixth in the worldwide edible oil consumption. China and India are the two largest consumers of peanut oil, accounting for 71.66 % of the total global production (United States Department of Agriculture, 2021). Peanut oil contains >80% unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid and oleic acid), which have a positive effect on reducing cardiovascular risk. It is also rich in other bioactive compounds, such as sterol, phospholipid, vitamin E, choline and so on (Zhang et al., 2022). In China, peanut oil, especially for fragrant peanut oil, is very popular as cooking oil due to its unique flavor. Flavor is an important aspect of sensory quality of vegetable oils, which largely determines consumer preference and purchase intention. Various peanut oil products are available in the market, which can be simply divided into cold-pressed oil and fragrant oil. Cold-pressed peanut oil is generally processed under the environment of lower than 60 \u00b0C, exhibiting a light flavor. In contrast, fragrant peanut oil has a unique strong flavor processed by high-temperature roasting and pressing. During roasting, abundant volatile components could be generated by complex chemical reaction, such as Maillard reactions, Strecker degradation and lipid oxidation. Their formation and abundance are strongly dependent on roasting conditions. Due to the differences in the raw materials and roasting intensity, peanut oil products show different sensory characteristics and can be further divided into different flavor types. However, rare study investigated the sensory characteristics of different type peanut oil. The key aroma compounds of peanut oil significantly affect the sensory property of peanut oil, but they are uncertain from the different flavor types aspects. Flavoromics is an approach to correlate the sensory properties of food to their aroma compounds, which can provide more comprehensive information on the flavor profile of food (Wang et al., 2022). The key is to combine the human perception and evaluation of flavor with instrument analysis and mathematical model analysis, so as to analyze the aromatic regularity of food more deeply. At present, more researchers have used this method for flavor research to determine key flavor compounds, characteristic flavor compounds and aroma boundary compounds of citrus fruits (Feng et al., 2021), barley malt (Gu et al., 2022), Baijiu (Wang et al., 2022), wine (P\u00e9rez-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2021) and mango (Aung et al., 2021), etc. With the help of flavoromics, we could unravel the relationship between aroma compounds of peanut oils and their sensory properties, which can further provide scientific reference for the regulation of oil processing and the production of specific fragrant oil. At present, some studies have identified the aroma components of peanut oil using headspace solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC\u2013MS) with/without electronic nose. Dun et al. (2019) have identified 101 volatile compounds in hot-pressed peanut oil and 64 volatiles in cold-pressed peanut oil through semi-qualitative analysis by HS-SPME and GC\u2013MS-O. Liu et al. (2011) have characterized 94 volatile compounds by HS-SPME/GC\u2013MS and found 12 pyrazines were considered to be the key contributors to the intense nutty/roasty flavor of aroma roasted peanut oil. Until now, major quantitative results for the volatiles of peanut oil are based on semi-qualitative analysis by the internal standard method. In contrast, external standard method could provide accurate quantitative analysis of volatile components, but it is rarely used in peanut oils. The multivariate chemometric methods are important tools to reveal the relationship between sensory properties and volatiles. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is a mathematical model that can analyze and explain the nonlinear relationship of multivariable, which has integrated the advantages of typical correlation analysis, multiple linear regression analysis and principal component analysis (Fan et al., 2006). It is widely used to establish the relationship between sensory properties and volatile compounds in the food field, such as cherry wine (Niu et al., 2011), rose essential oil (Xiao et al., 2017), lavender essential oil (Xiao et al., 2017), burnt scallion oil (Zhang, Wang, et al., 2022). Random forest is a simple and efficient machine learning program to determine outcome predictions using binary segmentation of predicted variables, which can handle data sets with large numbers of predictive variables and provide the highest prediction accuracy compared with other models (Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado et al., 2014). The classification and regression tree (CART) is another common machine learning algorithm based on tree structure, which is suitable for discrete data. When used for classification, CART has the advantages of low computational complexity, easy operation, simple interpretation and implementation. Random forest and CART have been widely used in various fields due to their great flexibility, but little research was related to sensory science. Vigneau et al. (2018) used random forest and CART to predict the important compounds associated with typical sensory attributes in red wine made from Cabernet Franc grape variety. Their results screened out the most important compounds and highlighted few useful compounds closely related to two main olfactory attributes. At the same time, they found that random forest model had better prediction ability than PLSR model. These multivariate data analysis methods could relate and predict the sensory characteristics to their volatile compounds, but they are rarely used in the analysis of peanut oil. Therefore, this study first identified the aroma compound composition of 33 representative peanut oils by absolute quantification. Then we evaluated the sensory characteristics of peanut oils and classified these oils into different aroma types according to their sensory properties. On this basis, PLSR, random forest and CART were employed to explore the relationship between volatile compounds and sensory properties, and differentiate key compounds of peanut oils with different aroma types. Our results can provide a theoretical basis for the classification of peanut oil based on sensory perspective, and developed a new pathway to screen out the key aroma compounds for the regulation of peanut oil processing. Material and methods Oil samples Thirty-three different brands of peanut oils (numbers were R1-R4, L1-L4, S1-S3, T1-T22) were obtained commercially from the Chinese market. R samples were cold-pressed peanut oil, and the rest samples were processed by roasting and pressing, which were in accordance with national standards and relevant enterprise standards. All samples were stored in a fridge at \u221220 \u00b0C until further analysis. They were sealed and thawed at room temperature for 1 h before the experiment. Chemicals All standard chemicals (GC grade, purity \u2265 95 %) were purchased, and their details are shown in Table S1. The n-alkanes solution (C6-C24) was obtained from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA. Analysis of volatile compounds by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC\u2013MS) The extraction of volatile compounds from each sample followed previously published method (Qian et al., 2019) with some modifications. The oil (5 g) was mixed with 10 \u00b5L of the internal standard 4-methyl-2-pentanol (1.0018 g/L) in a 20 mL vial capped with a PTFE-silicon septum. An automatic HS-SPME was used to extract volatile compounds on a CTC CombiPAL autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland). Samples were equilibrated at 40 \u00b0C for 30 min with a stirring rate of 500 rpm and then extracted at the same temperature for another 30 min by DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber (2 cm, 50/30 \u00b5m, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). After extraction, the SPME fiber were inserted into injector port and desorbed at 250 \u00b0C for 8 min, and each sample was tested in triplicate. An Agilent 6890 gas chromatography equipped with an Agilent 5975 mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to analyze the volatile compounds based on previous method (Qian et al., 2019) with minor modifications. An HP-INNOWAX capillary column (60 m \u00d7 0.25 mm, 0.25 \u00b5m thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) was used to separate the volatile compounds and the flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) was 1.5 mL/min. The heating procedure was as follows: the oven temperature kept at 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, then heated to 220 \u00b0C under a 3 \u00b0C/min speed, and finally kept at 220 \u00b0C for 5 min. The temperature of transfer line heater, ion source and quadrupole in the mass spectrometer were set as 250 \u00b0C, 250 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C, respectively. The ionization voltage was set at 70 eV and a full mass scan of 30\u2013350 m/z was applied. A series of C6-C24 n-alkane standards were analyzed to calculate retention indices (RI). The volatile compounds from various samples were identified by comparing their mass spectrum, RI with the NIST11 MS database and standard reference compounds. The quantification of compounds was based on the calibrated standard curve according to the previous method (Liu et al., 2022). Compounds without standards were relatively quantified using the standard curve of structural analogues. Peak area ratio was used for auxiliary quantification. The standard curve covered 75 standards and was diluted to 15 gradients, with 4-methyl-2-pentanol as the internal standard. The final concentrations (\u00b5g/g) were calculated according to the resulting standard curve formulas. Sensory evaluation Sensory evaluation of 33 peanut oils was performed using quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) by a trained and experienced panel (10 females, 40\u201350 years old) from COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute, Beijing (China). Before the experiment, panelist participated six rounds of sensory training in a standard sensory laboratory with a temperature of 25 \u00b0C and a humidity of 45% and passed the olfactory sensitivity test. The first two rounds mainly focused on discussing and merging descriptive words. Peanut oil samples were provided to the evaluator, and they were required to use the tasting cup with 15 mL of peanut oil for pre nasal sniffing and record the felt descriptive words. Sensory analysts collected, deleted duplicates, merged similar words, and then discussed with evaluators to select representative sensory descriptors and improve definitions and corresponding reference samples. The second round of training was based on the preparation and evaluation of the reference samples. Evaluators were required to sniff and determine whether the reference samples were suitable and representative based on different peanut oil samples, and ultimately determine the complete reference sample table. The last two experiments used neutral solution butanol as the intensity training matrix using a 2\u201310 gradient butanol solution (corresponding to 2\u201310 odor intensity). The evaluators first sniffed and remembered the corresponding sensory intensity in descending order of intensity; Secondly, butanol solutions with strengths of 3, 5, 7, and 9 were provided and evaluators were required to sort them and provide the correct order after sorting. Evaluators were also required to memorize, repeat intensity scoring exercises, and train their ability to recognize intensity. After training, the panelists were asked to assess the odorant characteristics of 33 peanut oil samples. Oils (10 mL) were presented in 25 mL brown glass bottles to subject according to a William Latin-square arrangement. Sensory attributes were obtained after discussing, screening and merging descriptors, and their intensities were scored on a 10 cm linear scale. The sensory attributes with a citation percentage (percentage of non-null scores, the overall assessors, samples and repetitions) higher than 15% were retained, leading to a list of eight orthonasal sensory attributes including \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019, \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018peanut butter-like\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019. The specific definitions and references to these sensory properties are shown in Table S2. The sensory evaluation experiment of 33 peanut oil was conducted for 7 rounds, with 4\u20135 groups of samples in each round for 2\u20133 h. The experiment was repeated 3 times. Random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) Multivariate Random Forest models were developed using the package \u201cRandom Forest SRC version 2.12.1\u201d to apply multivariate classification on the dataset of this study. Multivariate trees were constructed for multivariate outcomes. Optimal mtry and nodesize were tuned using out-of-bag error and then were adopted in following modelling. Tree size was set as 1000. Variable importance (VIMP) confidence internals were calculated by subsampling with subratio of 0.2. Variable importances were scaled to 100 and indicated with red color if the value was significantly higher than 0, suggesting positive importance for the classification. Parametric normal confidence regions and Delete-d jackknife variance estimator were used. Level of significance was set at 0.05. Package \u201cmvpart version 1.6\u20133\u201d was leveraged for generating recursive partitioning trees on multivariates. The size of the trees was 2000. Five multiple cross-validations were applied. Eleven groups of cross validation were built. Trees were selected by cross-validation and best tree was given within one standard error (SE) of the overall best. Root node error was calculated. Odor activity value (OAV) The OAV of a volatile compound was calculated through dividing its concentration by its odor threshold in oil. The odor thresholds of acetoin and acetol were determined in refined unscented oil using three-alternative forced-choice (3-AFC) procedure (diluted to ten concentrations for the test) according to ISO 13301:2018. Preliminary experiment was conducted using three olfactory sensitive evaluators to determine the approximate threshold range. The concentration that can be clearly felt by all three evaluators was set as the 7-8th concentration gradient, and was diluted layer by layer to prepared 10 concentration gradient samples. Each concentration gradient had two corresponding blank oil matrices as controls, and all samples were randomly coded with three digits. Ten trained evaluators sniffed the sample pairs according to the given coding order. Three samples were grouped into 10 gradients and sniffed sequentially from low to high. The target solution was required to be selected, and characteristic samples were provided to the evaluators. After sniffing one sample, 5 min break could be taken and the evaluator's sniffing accuracy were recorded. After the evaluation was completed, the results of the sensory evaluation group under each gradient were counted to calculate the experimental detection probability (p) that can correctly select the target compound under that gradient. Then, the probability parameter (chance factor) was used to calculate the corrected detection probability (P), as follows: P = 3 \u00d7 p-12 In the formula, p represented the actual detection probability in the experiment, P represented the detection probability corrected by chance probability, and the chance probability in the 3-AFC test is 1/3. The corresponding relationship between sample concentration and detection probability can be fitted using the sigmoid curve, and the fitting formula is as follows: P = 1 1 + e ( - ( x - x 0 ) / b ) In the formula, x represented the logarithmic value of the sample concentration, x0 represented the logarithmic value of the threshold concentration (when P = 0.5, x0 = x), and b represents the slope rate. When the detection probability reaches 50%, the minimum concentration of the corresponding sample is defined as the threshold concentration of the substance, that is, when the vertical axis P = 0.5, the corresponding value of horizontal axis is the logarithmic value of the threshold concentration of the target compound. SigmaPlot14.0 software was used to plot the obtained data and calculate the pre nasal threshold of the compound in the oil solution. Thresholds for other substances were obtained from literature and are detailed in Table 1 . Statistical analysis The heat map and box graphs were processed by Hiplot.com.cn. The standardization method for heat maps was set as row normalization, ward. D2 minimum variance clustering. PLSR and principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted by XLSTAT. The compounds with Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) > 1 were screened, and the model was considered reliable until Q2 > 0.4 and R2Y > 0.6. One-way ANOVA was performed by IBM SPSS Statistics 26. Results and discussion Sensory evaluation Quantitative descriptive sensory analysis (QDA) was applied to evaluate sensory properties of 33 peanut oil samples. Eight sensory attributes were selected for descriptive analysis, which were \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019, \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018peanut butter-like\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019. The intensity values of 8 sensory attributes in all samples have been summarized in Fig. 1 a and Fig. S1. Overall, most of the samples showed \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over- burnt\u2019 flavor, and the \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 was strong in fractional samples. \u2018Peanut butter-like\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019 were only felt in individual samples. Among these attributes, the intensity values of \u2018roasted nut\u2019 were higher than other properties, with an average value of 5.7 and a maximum value of 8.5 corresponding to T6. The results of \u2018over-burnt\u2019 and \u2018burnt\u2019 were similar, ranging from 0 to 6. The intensities of \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 were low, and only R1, R2, R3 and R4 exhibited obvious \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 with the values of 5.0, 6.2, 5.7 and 6.5, respectively; In contrast, the intensities of other samples ranged from 0 to 2.5. T2 and T13 had higher intensities of \u2018sweet\u2019, with respective intensities of 7.5 and 7, while the intensities of \u2018sweet\u2019 in R2, R3 and R4 were 0. The sensory intensities of \u2018peanut butter-like\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019 were relatively low. There were only 3 \u2018peanut butter-like\u2019 flavor samples (T3, T4, T7) and 4 \u2018puffed food\u2019 samples (S1, S2, S3 and L2). At the same time, we conducted a correlation analysis on these eight attributes, as shown in the Fig. 1b. Darker color represented a higher correlation between two attributes, that is, the closest correlation coefficient was 1. The positive correlation between \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018roasted nut\u2019 was high, followed by \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019 and \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018sweet\u2019. In addition, some attributes existed significantly negative correlation, such as \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 and \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019. This provided a good reference for the follow-up machine learning. The principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to demonstrate the relationship between peanut oils and their sensory attributes (as shown in Fig. 1c), and the two principal components F1 and F2 explained 74.94 % of the variance. The samples R1-4 were located in the third quadrant and closely related to the \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 attribute. S1 and S3 samples with \u2018puffed food\u2019 were clearly separated from other samples. S2 was classified as S sample because its process was similar to S1 and S3, and its \u2018puffed food\u2019 flavor was second after S1 and S3, which was placed in the first quadrant together with S1 and S3. l and T samples could be distinguished on F2. The characteristics of \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019 in T samples were stronger than those in L samples. In the Fig. 1d, \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019 and \u2018burnt\u2019 attributes were obviously similar and located closely, and \u2018peanut butter-like\u2019 and \u2018sweet\u2019 aroma were closed to each other. Most samples were associated with these five attributes. The four L samples in the second quadrant had low levels of \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019, so they were distributed near the middle. According to the results of PCA, we divided all 33 peanut oil samples into four types, namely, raw (R1-R4), light (L1-L4), salty (S1-S3) and thick (T1-T22) flavor. The differences in the aroma of peanut oils were closely related to their processing methods. Previous studies have reported that the peanut oil extracted from roasted peanuts had a \u2018baking smell\u2019 similar to \u2018roasted nut\u2019, while the cold pressed peanut oil was often \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018fatty\u2019 (Dun et al., 2019). Characterization of volatile compounds in peanut oils A total of 108 compounds were identified in the 33 samples by GC\u2013MS, including 21 aldehydes, 16 pyrazines, 13 alcohols, 11 acids, 6 phenols, 7 esters, 7 alkanes, 5 lactones, 4 terpenes, 4 pyrroles, 4 ketones, 4 furans, 3 compounds containing benzene ring, 1 thiazole, 1 amide, and 1 pyridine (Table S3). Most of the 33 peanut oil samples contained all the 108 compounds, except for T1 and T10 (detected 107 compounds), T8 (106 compounds), R3 (95 compounds), R4 (94 compounds) and R2 (92 compounds). In peanut oils, the compound with higher concentration was hexanoic acid (3.92\u201313.41 \u00b5g/g), followed by acetic acid (1.68\u20132.22 \u00b5g/g), 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2.86\u20132.97 \u00b5g/g), hexanal (0.71\u20138.25 \u00b5g/g) and 4-vinylguaiacol (0.86\u20137.14 \u00b5g/g). The compound with lower concentration was 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine, followed by 2-acetylfuran, ethyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-heptene-2-one and benzothiazole. Based on the distribution of volatile compounds, a cluster heat map was used to reveal the differences among various peanut oil samples (Fig. 2 ). According to the clustering heat map, S- and R- samples were obviously clustered into two categories. The contents of 2-methylfuran (0.064\u20130.080 \u00b5g/g), 2-acetyl pyrazine (0.037\u20130.046 \u00b5g/g), 2-furanmethanol (3.55\u20134.56 \u00b5g/g), 5-methyl-2-furanmethanol (0.08\u20130.13 \u00b5g/g), and pyrrole (0.029\u20130.350 \u00b5g/g) were higher in S-samples. 5-Methylfurfural (0.28 \u00b5g/g) and 2-pyrrolaldehyde (0.36 \u00b5g/g) were especially higher in S1. 2-Methylfuran, 2-acetyl pyrazine, 5-methylfurfural and 2-pyrrolaldehyde reached their thresholds in oil, which had \u2018chocolate\u2019, \u2018popcorn\u2019, \u2018caramel\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018nutty\u2019 flavors, respectively. Other compounds with higher contents belonged to pyrazines. Studies have found that N-heterocyclic compounds accounted for the highest proportion (61.68 %) in roasted peanut oils and pyrazines were the most abundant volatile compounds. Pyrazines were formed by the Maillard reaction between sugars and amino acids during seed roasting, usually accompanied by the generation of other N-heterocyclic compounds such as pyrrole and pyridine. Most of them exhibited \u2018baked\u2019, \u2018nutty\u2019, \u2018butter\u2019, \u2018baked potato\u2019 aroma attributes, and played a dominant role in the flavor of roasted seed oil because of their low thresholds and high dilution factors (Liu et al., 2011). In addition, roasting produced other volatile compounds, including furans, furanones, pyranones and cycloketones, and they together contributed to the \u2018nutty\u2019, \u2018roasted\u2019, and \u2018over-burnt\u2019 flavors, which were typical sensory characteristics of vegetable oils extracted from roasted seeds (Zhang et al., 2019). R samples had distinct aroma of \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 and slight aroma of \u2018roasted nut\u2019. The compounds with higher contents in R samples were (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal (0.086 \u00b5g/g, R2) (\u2018fatty\u2019), hexanol (2.32 \u00b5g/g, R3) (\u2018grassy\u2019), hexanal (8.25 \u00b5g/g, R2) (\u2018green\u2019), (E) \u22122-hexenal (0.049 \u00b5g/g, R3) (\u2018almon-like\u2019), (E)-2-heptenal (0.094 \u00b5g/g, R3) (\u2018green\u2019). Butyl 2-propenoate (0.088 \u00b5g/g) and butylacetate (0.0027 \u00b5g/g) (\u2018fruity\u2019) were higher in R1 and R2, while nonanol (0.30 \u00b5g/g) was higher in R3. Previous studies found that aldehydes mostly with \u2018green\u2019, \u2018fatty\u2019 and \u2018earthy\u2019 flavor were the main aroma odorants in cold pressed peanut oil, followed by alcohols and terpenes (Dun et al., 2019). Aldehydes and alcohols were formed by lipid oxidation and played an important role in the overall aroma of cold pressed peanut oil (Yin et al., 2022). Lipid oxidation mainly involved two pathways. One was lipoxygenase pathway that occurred during the division of oilseed cells, and the other was auto-oxidation during processing and storage. Hexanal and nonanal were the oxidation products of linoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively (Dun et al., 2019). Some alcohols were also formed by the reduction of their corresponding aldehydes, such as 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, 1-decanol, etc. (Wang et al., 2020). 4-Vinylguaiacol was a key phenolic compound in roasted peanut oil, which had a \u2018smoky\u2019 flavor and commonly produced by the thermal degradation of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and ferric acid (Ta\u0144ska et al., 2018), but this phenolic substance has not been detected in cold pressed peanut oil (Yin et al., 2022). However, in our study, 4-vinylguaiacol was detected in all four R samples, and the contents of R1-R4 were 1.28 \u00b5g/g, 0.86 \u00b5g/g, 0.96 \u00b5g/g and 0.91 \u00b5g/g, respectively. T samples mainly presented the flavor of \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019, and some samples also had obvious \u2018sweet\u2019 aroma, such as T2, T3 and T9 or \u2018peanut butter\u2019 such as T13 and T7. Samples with \u2018roasted nut\u2019 flavor tended to contain higher concentrations of pyrazines, as well as individual aldehydes such as 2-methylbutanal (1.18 \u00b5g/g, T3), 3-methylbutanal (0.50 \u00b5g/g, T2), and 2-methylpropanal (0.81 \u00b5g/g, T2), exhibiting \u2018malty\u2019 aroma. Some acids were also detected in T samples. Most acids were \u2018sweet\u2019 and \u2018cheese\u2019 flavor, and a few had \u2018vinegar\u2019 flavor, such as acetic acid. The contents of some acids in T samples were higher, for example nonanoic acid (0.10 \u00b5g/g, T7) (\u2018moldy\u2019), isobutyric acid (0.075 \u00b5g/g, T3) (\u2018cheese-like\u2019). However, their threshold values were relatively high, so their contributions to the overall flavor of peanut oil were not outstanding. In addition, there were esters, lactones, alkanes in peanut oils, but these odorants were not generally considered to have an important contribution to the flavor of oil due to their high odor thresholds. Among terpenes, d-limonene was widely concerned as a monoterpene and existed in many plants, which had \u2018citrus\u2019 and \u2018mint\u2019 flavor (Zhou et al., 2019). It generally disappeared in the later stage of peanut roasting, which may be related to its low volatility (Liu et al., 2011). In this study, d-limonene was detected in all samples ranging from 0.046 \u00b5g/g to 0.079 \u00b5g/g. Dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl trisulfide have been identified in peanut oil, which were less identified in previous studies (Yin et al., 2022). These sulfides were produced by sulfur-containing amino acids such as methionine, cysteine and cystine in peanuts through Maillard reaction or Strecker degradation (Jia et al., 2019). As for L samples, only the contents of acid compounds in L1 and L4 samples were high. Comparison of odorant activity value (OAV) in various peanut oil samples The concentrations of volatiles were not enough to reflect their importance to the flavor of peanut oil, and the contributions of key aroma compounds were also closely related to their aroma thresholds. The lower the threshold, the easier it could be perceived. OAV was the ratio of the concentration of compound to its threshold value in the same matrix. Generally, odorants with OAV greater than or equal to 1 were regarded as aroma-activate compounds, which had greater contribution to the flavor (Xu et al., 2022). The OAVs of odorants in 33 peanut oil samples have been shown in the Fig. S2. The 38 compounds with OAV \u2265 1 were ranked according to the mean values of OAV in 33 samples, and their retention index, aroma description, detectable threshold and significance between different samples are listed in Table 1. Among these compounds, 10 pyrazines and 10 aldehydes accounted for the highest proportion. Pyrazines such as 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-5-methylpyrazine, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, methylpyrazine, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-methylbutanal had high OAV values, which had \u2018roasted nut\u2019 and \u2018roasted potato\u2019 flavor and provided \u2018roasted nut\u2019 aroma to roasted peanut oil (Yin et al., 2022). Through one-way analysis of variance, 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, methylpyrazine, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 2-acetyl pyrazine and methylpyrazine had high significance in different flavor samples and were important odorants in peanut oil. Aldehydes were another aroma-active volatile compounds in peanut oils and were important to the overall aroma profile of peanut oil. 2- and 3-Methylbutanal with average OAVs of 203 and 43 contributed to the aroma of \u2018roasted nut\u2019. Benzeneacetaldehyde, hexanal and pentanal contributed to \u2018sweet\u2019, \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018fruit\u2019 aroma, and 2-pyrolaldehyde, furfural and 5-methylfural exhibited \u2018coffee\u2019, \u2018bread\u2019 and \u2018caramel\u2019 flavor. In addition, the average OAV values of 2-methylbutanal and 4-vinylguaiacol were the highest, which were 203 and 124, respectively. 4-Vinylguaiacol generally appeared in roasted peanut oil and was less detected in cold pressed peanut oil. At the same time, through the comparison between different types of samples, 2-furanmethanol, furfural, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine and methylpyrazine had significant differences between S and other samples, which proved that these compounds could well distinguish S samples; hexanal and hexanol had significant differences between R and other samples. The results of OAV played an important role in revealing the aroma-active odorants of peanut oil, and it also made a certain comparison and reference for the subsequent modeling analysis. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis PLSR could reveal the relationship between volatile compounds and sensory attributes (Zhang, Wang, et al., 2022). The compounds with Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) > 1 were screened, and the model was considered reliable until Q2 > 0.4 and R2Y > 0.6 (Liu, Gu, Laaksonen et al., 2022). Based on the modeling results, six ideal attributes were selected as the representative flavor of peanut oils including \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019. Twenty-nine compounds were strongly related to these sensory attributes, and 18 of them had a OAV great than 1. The modeling of \u2018peanut butter-like\u2019 and \u2018sweet\u2019 were not ideal due to the data structure of the sample so it was not discussed here (Table S4 for specific model parameters). Through PLSR analysis, the correlation coefficients between volatile compounds and each sensory attribute are summarized in the Table 2 . Some of these compounds had one-way positive or negative effects on the sensory attributes, such as (E)-2-heptenal (\u2018green, fat\u2019), 1-pentanol (\u2018sweet, fat\u2019), which only had a positive effect on the odour of \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019. 2-Methylpropanal (\u2018malt\u2019) had a positive effect on the odour of \u2018roasted nut\u2019 and \u2018burnt\u2019; 3-methylbutanal (\u2018malt\u2019) had a positive effect on \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019; nonanol (\u2018fat, fresh\u2019) had a negative effect on \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019. Zhang et al. (2022) analyzed the relationship between compounds and sensory properties of fried Allium tenuissimum L. flower oil by PLSR. Their results suggested that N-heterocyclic compounds such as methylpyrazine, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, were positively correlated with the sensory properties of \u2018roasty\u2019, and 2-pentylfuran, furfural and 2-furanmethanol had significant positive effects on \u2018caramel\u2019 properties. Furthermore, some compounds had positive correlations to some sensory attributes but negative correlations to other attributes, such as 2-acetyl pyrazine with \u2018popcorn\u2019 flavor had positive effects on \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019, but a negative effect on the \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019. On the other hand, hexanol (\u2018grassy\u2019) had a positive effect on \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 but a negative effect on \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019, as did hexanal (\u2018green\u2019, \u2018fresh\u2019, \u2018leaf\u2019) and 2-phenylethanol (\u2018floral\u2019). The PLSR results were well consistent with the aroma description of volatiles. Among these important variables, it was obvious that most alcohol compounds had a positive correlation with \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, and some had a negative correlation with \u2018roasted nut\u2019 and \u2018burnt\u2019 at the same time. The odorants positively related to \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019 aroma attributes were often negatively related to \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, such as pyrazines and individual aldehydes. In addition, five compounds, 2-pyrrolaldehyde (\u2018coffee\u2019), 5-methylfural (\u2018caramel\u2019), pyrazine (\u2018hazelnut\u2019), ethylbenzene and pyrrole (\u2018nutty\u2019), were also positively correlated with two highly correlated attributes (correlation coefficient = 0.73) of \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019 (Fig. 2b). Such results could guide us to study the interaction of interrelated odorants in the further and to clarify the effect of these compounds on the overall flavor in oil matrix. Random forest Random forest could establish a prediction model through variable selection. On the basis of reducing the burden of data analysis, key variables related to sensory attributes or aroma characteristics were accurately screened. Through the analysis and comparison of parameters, the R2 of \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019 were all above 0.7, indicating that the prediction results of these sensory attributes were better in this model. The random forest screened out 5 important compounds (red compounds in the Fig. 3 ) that affect these four attributes. The important volatile for \u2018roasted nut\u2019 was 2-methylbutanal; for \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019 were furfural, 2-furanmethanol, 5-methylfurfural, 2-acetyl pyrazine; for \u2018burnt\u2019 was 2-methylbutanal, and 2-acetyl pyrazine; for \u2018over-burnt\u2019 was 2-methylbutanal. The correlation matrix of sensory attribute (Fig. 2b) had confirmed that \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019 attribute were highly correlated. 2-Methylbutanal (\u2018cocoa\u2019, \u2018nut\u2019 and \u2018wheat\u2019) was served as the important compound for all these 3 attributes by random forest, which was also an important aromatic compound in roasted almonds and made an important contribution to roasted almond flavor (Erten & Cadwallader, 2017). It was produced by Strecker degradation of isoleucine (Whitfield & Mottram, 1992). The selected five important variables could be used as indicators of different sensory characteristics, providing basis for processing control of peanut oil. In this study, fewer important variables were screened out by random forest (5 variables) than PLSR (29 variables), and there were four compounds overlapped by the two methods, except 2-methylbutanal. Random forest and PLSR were always better than null model. Moreover, random forest retained fewer variables, which provided higher prediction accuracy and lowest prediction error (Vigneau et al., 2018). Classification and regression tree (CART) Each CART was constructed by means of the recursive binary partitioning of the dataset (Breiman, 2001). It is grown from a root at which all the observations are merged, and then is split into two subsets through successive nodes. The terminal nodes are usually called leaves and may contain a single observation if the tree is completely built. As shown in the Fig. 4 , there are 9 nodes in the regression tree and 6 compounds retained for prediction, including 4-vinylguaiacol (\u2018smoky\u2019), hexanol (\u2018grass\u2019), 2-acetyl pyrazine (\u2018popcorn\u2019), 2-methylbutanal (\u2018nutty\u2019, \u2018cocoa\u2019, \u2018malt\u2019), benzeneacetaldehyde (\u2018green\u2019, \u2018floral\u2019) and furfural (\u2018toasted\u2019, \u2018almond\u2019, \u2018sweet\u2019). The number of variables screened by CART was significantly lower than that by PLSR, and there were four replicates (hexanol, 2-acetyl pyrazine, benzeneacetaldehyde, furfural). Three compounds (2-acetyl pyrazine, 2-methylbutanal, furfural) were the same with the results of random forest. Two subsets were distinguished after nodes according to the concentrations of the compounds, and \u2018n\u2019 represented the number of samples. In the first step, 4-vinylguaiacol with a concentration of 1.34 \u00b5g/g was selected, and the compounds in node one were divided into two subsets. The left subset (No. 1\u20132) was further distinguished by hexanol at a concentration of 1.758 \u00b5g/g. Hexanol was described as \u2018grassy\u2019, and the samples in this subset were screened for R1, R2, R3, R4 and L1. Meanwhile, the bar chart also showed that the first subset had a distinct odour of \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019. The rightmost subset (No. 11) was separated by 2-acetyl pyrazine at a concentration of 0.03583 \u00b5g/g. It showed only three samples S1, S2 and S3, which exhibited higher \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019 than other groups. In the middle of eight group samples (No. 3\u201310), the No. 3\u20135 groups all had clear flavor of \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019 compared with the No. 6\u201310 groups. The \u2018sweet\u2019 was relatively weak when benzeneacetaldehyde < 0.2161 \u00b5g/g and furfural < 0.1839 \u00b5g/g. However, when the concentration of furfural > 0.1839 \u00b5g/g, the \u2018sweet\u2019 could not be perceived but \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019 could be perceived. When the concentration of benzeneacetaldehyde > 0.2161 \u00b5g/g, \u2018sweet\u2019 was obviously perceived. The No. 6\u201310 groups had obvious flavor of \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019 and \u2018over-burnt\u2019, but almost no \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019. The concentration distribution of six variables in the four flavor types of peanut oils have been shown in the Fig. 4. 2-Acetyl pyrazine could distinguish the raw flavor (R samples) well (P < 0.05). This result was consistent with the PLSR result, and 2-acetyl pyrazine had a significant negative correlation with \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019. Similarly, hexanol could well distinguish raw flavor from the other three flavor types (P < 0.001), so it might make a significant contribution to the raw flavor type samples. The content of furfural in S samples was significantly higher than that in the other three flavor types and it was considered as a candidate compound of salty flavor type; 4-vinylguaiacol and 2-methylbutanal had significant differences in thick (T samples) and raw flavor (P < 0.0001). Conclusion In this study, flavoromics was carried out to evaluate the characteristic of 33 fragrant peanut oils in China market from the aroma composition and sensory perspective. Among all identified compounds, 100 were accurately quantified, which mainly included aldehydes, pyrazines, alcohols, acids, phenols, esters, terpenes and other heterocyclic compounds. And 38 volatile compounds were detected with OAV \u2265 1. From the perspective of sensory properties, most commercial peanut oils presented \u2018fresh peanuts\u2019, \u2018roasted nut\u2019, \u2018burnt\u2019, \u2018over-burnt\u2019 and \u2018sweet\u2019 flavor, and a few samples had \u2018puffed food\u2019 and \u2018exotic flavor\u2019. They can be classified into four aroma types, namely raw, light, thick and salty. The relationship between the volatiles and sensory characteristics has been established using multi-analytical approach. Partial least squares regression analysis identified 29 compounds with potential contributions to the specific aroma of peanut oil, while random forest and regression tree screened out 5 and 6 key aroma compounds. The concentration of 2-acetyl pyrazine was lower in the raw aroma type oil, while hexanol was higher. 2-Methylbutanal and 4-vinylguaiacol contributed significantly to the \u2018roasted nut\u2019 of peanut oil, which could be used as the signature compound of thick flavor. Furfural was the characteristic compounds in the salty type peanut oil. Compared with PLSR, random forest and regression tree could greatly reduce the number of variables while finding the key compounds that affect the aroma types of peanut oil. Furthermore, CART provided complementary information about the effects of volatile concentrations on sensory attributes and flavor type, which was more conducive to the process control of specific flavor. In the future research, these important variables can be applied to study the formation mechanism of characteristic aroma and evaluate the quality and grade of peanut oil. The important variables selected in this study need to be verified by aroma omission and recombination test, so as to provide scientific basis for processing specific fragrant oils.

See Table 1 for the definition of ML terms and the explanation of symbols. Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Indicative data pre-processing and use. Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Principal components, t 1 and t 2, are linear combinations of the original descriptors, x 1 and x 2, and correspond to the definition of a new set of axes in which t 1 accounts for the greatest variance. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 The process of generating a fingerprint based on path length [83,88]. Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Decision tree for the Crabtree catalyst exemplar described in Scheme 1. Branch points correspond to the presence or absence of iridium and thresholds on the descriptor values; values at the leaves are relative rate. Due to the size of the exemplar data the tree is grown to its maximum depth. Otherwise, the mean values of every instance in the leaves would be taken as the prediction for this regression problem. Fig. 5 Fig. 6 2D scatter plot of the input (training) instances based on two descriptors, belonging either class P or Q. Applying 3-nearest-neighbour algorithm would classify the unseen instance as P, since two (majority) of the three nearest neighbours belong to that class. Fig. 6 Fig. 7 The kernel function, K, transforms the data from the input space (left) to a higher dimensional feature space (right) where linear boundaries can be found. Fig. 7 Fig. 8 Illustration of a single layer perceptron. Fig. 8 Fig. 9 An exemplar neural network using the values for the Crabtree catalyst \u2018toy problem\u2019 (Scheme 1), where the presence of Ir and Rh could be encoded as \u201c1\u201d for present and \u201c0\u201d for absent, with a single hidden layer of eight nodes. The network is fully connected with a weight for each connection, but only one weight, w, is shown on the scheme for clarity. Note there is also an activation function between each layer and a bias between the hidden and output layer. The prediction is normalised to get the final activity of 0 or 1. After training, values for w, each node, and bias are established. For a new catalyst, e.g., [Ir(LB)(LC)(cod)]+ as an input, with the respective descriptor values, the neural network could predict whether or not this catalysis is active.

The benefits of using machine learning approaches in the design, optimisation and understanding of homogeneous catalytic processes are being increasingly realised. We focus on the understanding and implementation of key concepts, which serve as conduits to more advanced chemical machine learning literature, much of which is (presently) outside the area of homogeneous catalysis. Potential pitfalls in the \u2018workflow\u2019 procedures needed in the machine learning process are identified and all the examples provided are in a chemical sciences context, including several from \u2018real world\u2019 catalyst systems. Finally, potential areas of expansion and impact for machine learning in homogeneous catalysis in the future are considered. Graphical Abstract ga1 Keywords Homogeneous catalysis Machine learning Cheminformatics 1 Introduction Machine learning methods are becoming increasingly common in the chemical sciences to efficiently analyse the vast amount of data generated by experimentation and guide scientists to their next reaction [1]. Machine learning has had notable recent success in retrosynthesis [2] and reaction condition prediction [3], advanced by ever increasing computational power and data availability. We herein focus on recent advances in the relatively underexplored field of machine learning for ligand promoted homogeneous catalysis. By focussing on key machine learning concepts, illustrated by examples from homogeneous catalysis, this review serves as a conduit between synthetic chemists and more advanced literature. We build on recent reviews on machine learning in synthetic chemistry [4\u201311], focussing more exclusively on ligand promoted homogeneous catalysis. We assume basic knowledge of homogeneous catalysis and refer readers to reviews in that area [12\u201315]. We define here a selective homogeneous catalyst as ML n, where M is the activating \u2018template\u2019, most typically a metal (but potentially also an organocatalytic centre, such as H+), and L n are the reacting and/or controlling ligands through which catalysis is attained. To avoid potential confusion, we abbreviate machine learning (ML) in italics throughout this text. The opportunities of combining synthetic methods with ML investigation can be illustrated in the application of catalyst screening. Classical catalyst development approaches typically change only one variable between consecutive reactions (runs) [16]. Such strategies converge only slowly towards improved outcomes. The benefit of ML methods in extracting the features responsible for excellence in catalysis is readily apparent from the following na\u00efve example: a single reaction using a single ML2 catalyst with a library of five metals and a 20 mono-dentate ligands already provides 1050, i.e., 5 \u00d7 21!/(2!19!), pre-catalytic MLALB combinations. The number of experimental runs required will be even greater, once other variables (e.g., catalyst activation additives, reaction solvent, temperature, time) are allowed for. An advantage of ML models is they can identify, often rapidly, complicated patterns in multi-dimensional space that the human brain cannot easily envisage. Humans can visualise patterns in two-, three- and even four-dimensional data, but reactions rely on the best combination of a series of variables, and spotting patterns in a matrix of trial runs is challenging. While high throughput experimental (HTE) methods can presently (just about) deal with \u2018screening\u2019 high numbers of experiments (runs), they quickly become expensive in both resources and time as the number of parameters increase. ML methods can augment HTE approaches by reducing the overall number of runs by running fewer initial experiments and predicting the remainder [17]. 2 Machine learning concepts 2.1 Introduction to machine learning Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the field of computer programs or machines which can mimic human intelligence, such as solving problems and learning. ML is a subset of AI, wherein algorithms are used to learn from a dataset and thus make predictions when provided with novel data. A range of ML methods is presented in Section 3. Broadly, ML approaches can be divided into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning methods are supplied with input (training) data, including the target (response) variable of interest. The data are \u201clabelled\u201d, and the output is known for each input (in the context of chemistry, this might be the yield or selectivity to a specific species). Supervised learning infers a general function, mapping the input to output based solely on the training data. This function is evaluated to predict the output when presented with an unseen (new) input. Conversely, unsupervised learning attempts to \u201cautomatically\u201d find patterns or associations within unlabelled data (here there is no pre-defined output as a part of the input data). Reinforcement learning is about \u201cacquiring knowledge\u201d for selecting the most appropriate action to take at a given state when interacting with an environment, maximising a notion of cumulative reward over time. Readers should refer to the existing literature on unsupervised and reinforcement learning for examples where these techniques have been applied to chemistry [18\u201320]. Herein we focus on supervised learning approaches, as they offer the simplest entry to ML use. 2.2 Some vocabulary Fig. 1 illustrates a generic ML process and Table 1 defines some key ML terms in supervised learning. After collecting the crude data, these are pre-processed and prepared as input for the ML algorithm. The ML algorithm produces a function mapping the input to an output through training. The model constructed by the ML algorithm is subsequently able to predict the output when supplied with a new unseen instance. Section 3 provides a comprehensive explanation of such ML workflows. The interface of chemistry and ML has developed its own specialist terminology. It is important to understand this to avoid contextual misunderstandings. Hence, we cover and clarify similar terminologies used in both disciplines in this section. The simple word \u2018optimisation\u2019 is prevalent in both chemical and ML literatures, but is generally used in a much more focused manner in the latter. In chemical catalysis \u2018optimisation\u2019 indicates a real-world study that has improved a specific reaction outcome: such as yield, selectivity or rate. However, within ML literature, \u2018optimisation\u2019 is used with its strict mathematical meaning, i.e., finding the best alternative(s) with the maximum or minimum objective value(s), and can be employed within almost any stage of the ML process from data pre-processing to model training and even for model selection [21]. The terms \u2018descriptor\u2019 and \u2018parameter\u2019 are sometimes presented as synonyms in the catalytic ML literature. However, in ML the terms are distinct: descriptors represent chemical properties (Fig. 1 and Table 1), whereas parameters are values internally related to the ML model that are estimated or learned from the data, e.g., the weights of a neural network (see later, Section 3.4.6). A more general term for a descriptor is a \u2018feature\u2019 and this term is also common in both ML and chemistry literatures. Finally, another critical term in ML is \u2018hyper-parameter\u2019 representing an adjustable parameter of an ML algorithm, such as the learning rate for training a neural network. The performance of many ML algorithms, in terms of predictive accuracy or the efficiency of training, can depend significantly on the settings of the hyper-parameters. Thus, their optimisation (or tuning) is important [22]. 2.3 An exemplar system for illustrating basic ML concepts ML methods use computer algorithms used to detect hidden patterns within data that would not be revealed by human inspection. However, this trait is not so useful when trying to teach how ML predictions are achieved when novel instances are supplied (Fig. 1). To make progress we will commence our discussion with a \u2018toy problem\u2019 for which we already know the answer: alkene (CC) hydrogenation using Crabtree\u2019s catalyst (2) [23] and its analogues ( Scheme 1). Simple triphenylphosphine, PPh3 (L A ), and pyridine (L B ) and suitable iridium sources provide the initial iridium species [Ir(COD)(D1)(D2)]+ (1\u20133) (where M = Ir and D1 and D2 are suitable donors, specifically either L A or L B ). In the following discussion, P,N refers to a system where one of L A or L B is phosphine-type (PR3) and the other is amine-type (NR3), and P,P and N,N refer to instances where both ligands are phosphine- or amine-type respectively. Literature precedent [23,24] shows that the mixed P,N system (2) leads to the most active (most product formed fastest) catalyst, the P,P system (1) less so, and N,N ligands lead to very inactive species (3). For the rhodium analogues (4\u20136) (M = Rh), it is the P,P system (4) that is most active (principally due to decomposition of nitrogen ligated species 5\u20136 under the hydrogenation conditions). Scheme 1 details five descriptors, selected for their potential influence on activity, which were collected for the organometallic complex: the pKaH for L A and L B , together with their molecular weight (mwt), and electronegativity (\u03c7). While a wide range of descriptors could be used for L A and L B , we use here three simple examples that clearly relate real-world properties of the ligands: pKaH (correlating to \u03c3-electron density of the donor ligand); molecular weight (mwt, as a very simple measure of ligand bulk); and donor-atom electronegativity (\u03c7) as a moderator of ligand donation potential. See further discussion on descriptors in Section 3.3. The catalytic activity for 1\u20136, as estimated from published turnover numbers, is given as the figure of merit (target to be predicted) [23,24]. Given a new ligand, L c , the activity of [Ir(COD)(L B )(L c )]+, 7, for example, can be predicted based on the regression model, or simply classified as active or inactive (Table within Scheme 1). Our subsequent ML discussions will exemplify the process of attaining such predictions. 2.4 Classification and regression Classification and regression are two key types of supervised learning tasks [25,26]. A classification model will identify which of two (or more) categories the new input belongs to, whereas a regression model will predict a numerical output. In the case of the \u2018toy problem\u2019 in Scheme 1, a classification task will categorise incoming data into a series of classes, i.e., \u201cGiven M(D1)(D2), would the resultant catalyst be active?\u201d Assuming that instead of categories we have numerical values of catalytic activity for each instance in the table in Scheme 1, then, given an unseen instance, the regression task could predict its catalytic rate, i.e., \u201cGiven M(D1)(D2), what would be its predicted relative rate?\u201d Section 3.4 onwards cover studies using regression approaches. If a larger or more ambiguous dataset had been used from the start, ML could be used to reveal that (i) Crabtree\u2019s catalyst [Ir(COD)(L A )(L B )]+ (2) hydrogenates hindered alkenes faster than any other member of the library, (ii) the instances sorted into the \u2018high\u2019 activity category are commonly the Ir/P,N catalyst type, or (iii) Crabtree\u2019s catalyst [Ir(COD)(L B )(L c )]+, a new instance for which catalytic activity may not have been measured, is predicted to have high catalytic activity based on a model trained on 1\u20136. 2.5 Expectations and limitations of ML Before discussing ML workflows, it is important to appreciate what can be expected from ML analysis and its potential limitations. ML needs significant data (typically instances equal to at least five times the number of descriptors used) to learn from. It will also predict much more accurately on examples close to the training data than on cases that are distant from what it has learnt. Diverse data are better; discarding \u2018poor\u2019 yield/selectivity catalytic run data should be discouraged. Scheme 2 summarises the tools that ML novices and their collaborators need to assemble to make a start, and the outcomes that it could be possible to achieve. The primary requirement is for high quality data [27]. Firstly, the choice of label or experimental data utilised is important. Chemical science\u2019s most commonly collected output - the \u2018% yield\u2019 of a reaction \u2013 is often a poor choice. Yield is subject to the vagaries of the isolation, interpretation and reporting processes (e.g., isolated yields versus NMR/Gas Chromatography yields). Measures of reaction selectivity, such as %ee value or some other stereoselectivity indicator, are better choices of output, but these results can also be affected by whether the value was measured before or after purification or isolation [17]. Additionally, stereoselectivity can also be measured directly on crude reaction mixtures. Secondly, bias in datasets is a key problem, for example, not reporting low yield or failed reactions leads to data with few negative examples. Lastly, availability of data, either absence of data, low quality data (without conditions or experimental error), propriety data, or the difficulty in querying databases also can hinder producing a dataset [28]. Recent efforts such as Open Reaction Database [29] have attempted to alleviate these problems, but much work is still required to make data accessible and standardised [30]. The amount of data required for a model varies significantly with the ML method used and the scope of the model; a model built on more (diverse) data will typically be able to cover a larger chemical space as most ML models can only extrapolate to a certain extent. There is no specific rule on the minimum amount of data, with models < 100 instances still providing useful models, if only a modest number of descriptors is used [31]. Thus, the number of experiments in a catalyst screen may be reduced by running several hundred and predicting the remainder. Although ML can provide accurate and useful results, it can be much more difficult to determine why the model has made a certain prediction, especially with so-called \u201cblack-box\u201d ML approaches, where outputs can make it difficult to predict what should be the next steps in a catalyst\u2019s development. To overcome this, developing explainable and interpretable AI is an important and a rapidly developing field [32\u201334]. To make ML models more interpretable, both the machine learning method and the choice of descriptors should be considered. In general, the simplest model is the easiest to interpret. This may be a model with fewer descriptors or an ML model that is easy to analyse (e.g., a decision tree) [8,35]. See later sections on descriptors, ML algorithms and case studies for examples of interpretable models. Finally, it is important that the ML research itself is reproducible. Recent guidelines [36] have set out the need for code and data to be accessible and full details of training and validation to be disclosed. To return to Crabtree\u2019s catalyst, to further improve the catalyst for CC hydrogenation, we would subsequently need to identify or locate the characteristics of the catalytic metal or ligands which are most influential on the activity. This can be achieved by evaluating the relative influence of the descriptors on the predicted activity [37]. This will allow design of improved ligands L A\u2019 and/or L B\u2019 that maximise these descriptor(s) \u2018information\u2019 (for example by including: M-L bond length or pertinent stereoelectronic properties of the ligand, among many potential examples). This might give an indication of stereoselectivity or mechanistic understanding, but full mechanistic understanding is still largely the domain of quantum chemical studies [38]. By advancing the design process in silico, the number of experimental reactions can be reduced, thus saving time and resources. 3 Machine learning workflow 3.1 Identifying a chemical problem ML can be applied to a wide range of problems in chemistry. However, obtaining enough high-quality data is often a challenge in chemistry, as mentioned in Section 2.5. An ideal chemical problem would involve a dataset comprising hundreds to millions of instances, which is potentially easily attainable through literature mining, HTE or computational methods. The instances should include a wide range of values to encompass the breadth of the problem. A model must know about failures, successes and the range in between to deal effectively with unseen instances (i.e., new catalyst formulations). It is important that the data be drawn from the underlying distribution so that patterns, perhaps arising from related structures or the presence of certain functional groups, can be learned. Simultaneously attaining all the above criteria is often difficult. Data may be limited, due to instances being expensive to generate, and literature datasets can frequently be skewed to a (false) positive outcome or can be encoded in unhelpful/non extractable way. However, there are ways of overcoming these challenges [39]. 3.2 Data preparation and pre-processing Data preparation and pre-processing takes raw \u201creal-world data\u201d and converts it into a machine-readable format, suitable for presenting as input to an ML computer program. There are many techniques for data preparation and pre-processing, including data cleaning, scaling, data balancing, dimensionality reduction, instance reduction, and more. See subsequent sections for examples of data preparation and pre-processing. Often, it is not necessary to apply all those techniques while tackling a problem, which would ultimately depend on the data being used. In this section, we concisely explain some of the selected techniques. Fig. 2 represents a typical approach to data pre-processing and use. 3.2.1 Issues with data The first step is to collect the data from experiments or the literature. It is imperative to ensure that the data is error free. For example, in a stereoselective reaction, it should be checked that the enantiomer of the product, and any ligand used, has been correctly assigned. Data should be collected into a database or other suitable machine-readable form such as comma separated values (.csv) file. Care should be taken to ensure units are consistent. In a real-world raw dataset, there are frequently issues to be resolved, such as missing descriptors and improper data types. Therefore, checking the data initially is important [40], for example, in a ligand screen, there may be missing runs. A trivial fix for missing descriptors would be dropping the relevant instances and/or descriptors containing null/empty values, which can cause loss of valuable information. There are also data imputation methods based on machine learning and optimisation, which can generate substitutes for the missing data values [41,42]. It is important that the data types are appropriate and consistent for each descriptor within the dataset. For example, if there are categorical descriptors, e.g., a category of ligand size, that can be ordinal (that can be ordered), such as \u201csmall\u201d< \u201cmedium\u201d< \u201clarge\u201d (e.g., they can be processed and encoded as 1 <2 <3). Alternatively, the descriptors may be nominal, i.e., cannot be ordered, such as catalyst or reagent form (\u201csolution\u201d, \u201csolid\u201d or \u201cunknown\u201d). A pre-processing phase would involve ensuring that the categorical data for the descriptor are labelled appropriately. 3.2.2 Feature scaling Feature (descriptor) scaling or transformation is a process which ensures different numerical variables within the dataset are all on the same scale, which allows each variable to be considered by the ML method equally [43]. For example, %selectivity falls on a scale of 0\u2013100, whereas a temperature range within a study could be far wider, or narrower. Without adjustment, these two features would not be treated comparably, potentially leading to a bias within the analysis [44]. Where an ML algorithm is heavily affected by the range of a descriptor (i.e., the larger the range of a descriptor the larger its influence on the calculation), scaling is essential. Other ML algorithms that construct models without using a distance metric may eliminate the importance of descriptor scaling. (See later: distance-based algorithms including k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM) and neural networks; models that do not use distance metrics include decision trees and random forests). The main descriptor scaling methods are standardisation and normalisation [45]. The standardisation process computes the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of the values (X), and then from each data entry the mean is subtracted, and the resultant value is divided by standard deviation producing a substitute value, X\u2019 (Eq. 1). The normalisation method, also known as max-min scaling, finds the minimum (X min) and maximum (X max) values for the descriptor, then subtracts the minimum from the data entry dividing the resultant value by the difference between the maximum and minimum values for scaling (Eq. 2). (1) X \u2032 = X \u2212 \u03bc \u03c3 (2) X \u2032 = X \u2212 X min X max \u2212 X min Both processes are highly sensitive to outliers, as skewed input data will lead to skewed scaled data. Several other scaling techniques, out of the scope of this overview, can deal with outliers. Descriptor and instance selection (i.e., excluding a ligand or descriptor extremely different to the bulk) can also be useful. 3.2.3 Data balancing Handling imbalanced data (in which some crucial aspects are underrepresented and/or skewed) which influences the ML performance is a challenging issue in supervised learning. For example, the number of instances in one class (e.g., low temperature catalyst runs) might be significantly fewer than other classifications (e.g., medium to high temperature runs). This could be a problem because ML algorithms often attempt to maximise accuracy and minimise error in predictions, and they may simply predict that all instances belong to the majority class. The performance of an ML algorithm can be improved through data balancing, for example via sampling. Oversampling augments the original dataset by generating artificial data to add under-represented data. One of the commonly used techniques is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for classification and its variant SMOTER that adopts SMOTE for regression[44,46]. Undersampling is the opposite strategy, where instances are removed from the dataset. Singular metrics to evaluate the performance of ML algorithms (i.e., reduced to a single value such as accuracy and error) can be sensitive to imbalanced data. Performance metrics are discussed in Section 3.4. Hence, the choice of the performance metric is important while applying a data balancing technique. He et al. and Branco et al. cover various techniques for data balancing along with potential issues and relevant informative performance metrics [44,46]. 3.2.4 Dimensionality reduction An important characteristic of a dataset is its dimensionality, i.e., the number of descriptors it has. Dimensionality reduction is concerned with mapping the data from this high-dimensional space to lower-dimensional space, whilst maintaining the significant patterns in the initial data. Reducing the number of dimensions in the data enables simplified models to be used and patterns in the data to be more easily spotted. Additionally, overfitting [47], where models are trained too tightly to the detriment of new test data, can be avoided. This can also allow faster training. Without such processes, as more descriptors are added, the number of data instances required by the model grows too rapidly for accurate predictions to be made \u2013 the so-called \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019[48]. Feature selection and feature projection can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a descriptor set ( Scheme 3). Feature selection is a form of dimensionality reduction for choosing a subset of relevant descriptors for ML methods [49]. For applications in ligand promoted homogeneous catalysis, the influence of some features might not be sufficiently obvious for the selection(s) to be done manually. A more programmatic approach would be to use variance thresholds, whereby the variance of each descriptor is computed and if that value does not exceed the specified threshold, then the descriptor is removed, on the basis that a descriptor with limited variation will have limited predictive power [50]. Feature selection methods can be categorised as filter, wrapper, or embedded. Filter methods [51] are used in the pre-processing stage and are independent of any model built. A subset of descriptors is selected, based on the relationship of each descriptor with the target variable, based on a metric such as correlation. Wrapper methods [52] perform a search of descriptors guided by the performance of the subsequent model built. Either an initial model is built with a small subset of descriptors, and more descriptors added (forward selection), or descriptors are removed from an initial model containing all descriptors (backwards elimination). Embedded methods [53] are more advanced and select descriptors while constructing the model based on fitting errors, and their hybrids. Feature projection (also called feature extraction) is another approach to dimensionality reduction, where the original descriptors are used to generate a smaller set of descriptors that define the instances within the data set more usefully (and succinctly) than the original ones. This technique moves the data with high dimensionality to a space with fewer dimensions. There are various feature projection methods which include Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Independent Component Analysis [54], Autoencoder, Random Projection [53], Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Partial Least Squares (PLS), and more. In this section, we explain the latter two well-known methods. PCA [55,56] takes the original data and creates linear combinations (called principal components) of the descriptors and projects them on to a set of orthogonal axes ( Fig. 3). The principal components are ranked in order of importance based their variance to summarise the original data distribution optimally. Optimally in this case means maximising the variance of the principal component. The first principal component shows the greatest variance in the data. PCA preserves large pairwise separations better than smaller ones. In other words, instances that are well separated in the original descriptor space will still be well separated after the PCA. PCA is an unsupervised method. It does not distinguish any labelling of the data and only identifies the variance of the descriptors, which could lead to data loss. The cumulative variance retained gives an indication of how much data has been preserved. If the dataset is reduced too much, underlying trends in the data towards the target value may be lost. Although it is trivial to see the influence of each descriptor on each principal component, it does make subsequent analysis of the model harder as the original descriptors are not directly used, which makes it harder to explain the predictions based on the descriptor importance or other analysis. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) method [57] is applied to both the descriptors and the target variable. Latent variables, t, are linear combinations of descriptors, and the target variable, y, is predicted based on a linear combination of the latent variables: (3) y = a 1 t 1 + a 2 t 2 + a 3 t 3 + \u2026 + a n t n where the coefficients a are weighting coefficients. Usually only the first few latent variables are used, with the number determined through a cross-validation approach. PLS serves to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by aggregation of collinear descriptors. This is similar to PCA (see Fig. 3 and above), but the target variable is considered. In particular, PLS defines latent variables which maximise the covariance of the descriptors and the target variable. PLS is most effective on datasets with high collinearity, as this enables the reduction of the data into a handful of descriptors that account for the majority of the variability in the target variable. A poor ratio of data to descriptors is a common issue in chemistry that has made PLS a popular method in the field [58,59]. It has the same drawbacks as PCA in data loss and linear modelling. There are many other dimension reduction techniques beyond PCA and PLS. One example is Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), which has found particular use for quickly mapping chemical space. While the details of this algorithm are out of the scope of this review, we refer readers to the following references [60,61]. 3.2.5 Data splitting and validation The primary goal of a supervised ML technique is to train a model in order to predict a desired characteristic of previously unseen test examples correctly. Holdout is the simplest approach to data splitting. Partitions for training and testing is achieved through random sampling of instances. The size of the subset of data for training is usually larger than for testing (e.g., 70:30 or 80:20). Achieving high training accuracy alone is not fully useful, if the prediction is not accurate enough based on the test data. Large differences in predictive accuracy on training and test data of unseen instances indicate that the model is overfitted (often caused by too many descriptors for the number of instances). A well-established protocol to estimate the presence of such errors is to apply cross-validation, in which the dataset is partitioned into multiple subsets, a part of which is used for training and the rest for validation and testing. The most common cross-validation approaches are k-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation [62]. In the former, the dataset is split into k subsets and, sequentially, k - 1 of them are used for training and the remaining one for testing. This approach is repeated k times, until all subsets are used once for testing. Leave-one-out cross-validation involves using a single instance in the dataset as test data and the remaining instances as training data, until all instances are used for testing once. In other words, the procedure is the same as in k-fold cross-validation, but in this case, k is the number of instances in the dataset. However, this requires large computational power and time when the dataset is large. If the hyper-parameters of an ML algorithm require optimisation, a nested cross-validation approach is usually applied, whereby the hyper-parameters are tuned based on a validation subset of data. Then the tuned final model is evaluated on the test set to ensure the integrity of the estimate of the predictive accuracy of the model [63]. 3.3 Descriptors Descriptors represent characteristics of a chemical entity in a form suitable for ML algorithms, so that they can be used to create models. Molecular descriptors themselves may be characterised by the dimension of their representation of the molecule (1D\u20134D), or by their nature (constitutional, topological, geometric, electrostatic, and quantum mechanical), although these groupings overlap. One might anticipate that the more sophisticated the descriptor, the more predictive the model. However, this is not always the case and working upwards from the simplest descriptors often provides insights. 1D descriptors contain global information about the molecular structure, for example, atom or fragment counts, molecular weight, etc. Their simplicity means they can suffer from degeneracy and the identity of isomeric compounds are lost. Models based on 1D descriptors can provide a useful baseline approach and such descriptors can contribute to predictive models in combination with other descriptors. 2D (bond connectivity) descriptors are very common [64], with free and commercially available programs able to generate many different types with minimum computational time. They are derived from chemical structures and describe connectivity and structure within molecules. The number of bond types or counts of aromatic rings can be included, analogous to topological descriptors. The distance between two coordinating atoms in a ligand would be an example of a 2D descriptor. 3D descriptors rely on the generation of 3D structure via molecular mechanics or ab initio calculations [65]. Depending on the level of theory, they may be time-consuming to calculate. Examples include the principal moment of inertia, representations of the solvent accessible areas or van der Waals volume [66]. Molecular interaction fields, popularised in the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) technique [67], also find utility in 3D ML studies of catalysis [68]. Finally, 4D descriptors take conformational changes over time into account by taking the average of conformers generated over the course of a molecular simulation. 4D descriptors are very computationally expensive to calculate, but the information derived is complex and detailed [69,70]. Experimental descriptors are also common. However, they can be expensive if they can only be obtained by time-consuming experimentation or lengthy literature searches. However, these descriptors themselves can be often predicted. The Hammett \u03c3 constants measure the electron-donating and -withdrawing power of organic substituents. They were traditionally calculated from experimental ionisation energies [71]. However, there has been recent effort to directly calculate these parameters for new substituents without the need for additional experimentation [72]. Another example are descriptors developed by Tolman [73], such as his experimentally measured Tolman Cone Angle (TCA) which describes the steric bulk of ligands. More recently, TCA was calculated from quantum-mechanically optimised 3D ligand structures and used to predict catalytic activity [74]. Other descriptors which may be experimentally derived or calculated are pKa [75] and electronegativity [76]. The interpretability of models can also be improved through the choice of descriptor [77]. A small number of \u201chand-crafted\u201d descriptors, which chemists intuitively understand, can result models which are easily to analyse and justify. One study advocated for spectroscopic descriptors which were physically meaningful, cheap and extensive [78]. 3.3.1 SMILES and InChI Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a line entry format for chemical structure notation [79]. SMILES is a workhorse in cheminformatics, providing a compact string representation of molecules which is machine readable. There are various utilities for converting SMILES into two- or three-dimensional representations of the molecule [80]. The simple rules for constructing a SMILES string are given in Table 2. For example, the SMILES representation of the molecule benzoic acid is \u2018c1ccccc1C(=O)O\u2019, combining the rules from Table 2 for the aromatic benzene ring and carboxylic acid; the number of hydrogen atoms required to satisfy valency are usually implicit. Stereochemistry can be shown in SMILES, and each SMILES uniquely represents a molecule. However, depending on which atom the SMILES begins with, a molecule may have many valid SMILES. For full SMILES rules refer to the established guidelines [79]. International Chemical Identifier (InChI) is another string representation of molecules [81]. Benzoic acid is denoted 1 S/C7H6O2/c8\u20137(9)6\u20134\u20132\u20131\u20133\u20135\u20136/h1\u20135 H,(H,8,9)\u2019. \u20181 S\u2019 defines the version number, \u20181\u2019, and \u2018S\u2019 refers to the fully standardised version of the InChI (StdInChI). \u2018C7H6O2\u2019 is the empirical formula, the next section defines which atoms are connected, and the final section denotes which atoms have hydrogen atoms. Most of an InChI string is human-readable and they can include information about tautomeric state and stereochemistry. Unlike SMILES, every chemical structure has a unique StdInChI string, which is useful if isomeric compounds appear in the data set. InChI forms are long and of non-fixed length for large molecules, which can handicap comparing the similarity of two structures. StdInChIKey, an algorithm generated (non-human readable) fixed-length string facilitates storage, but cannot be directly converted back to the chemical structure [82]. 3.3.2 Fingerprints Molecules are often represented by chemical \u2018fingerprints\u2019 to aid substructure and similarity searches [83,84]. These fingerprints are of a pre-defined length (though the actual length depends on the fingerprint used) and broadly fall into two categories: structural key based and hashed based fingerprints. Structural key fingerprints (such as MACCS [85] and PubChem [86]) encode predefined structural features, such as a substructure or fragment, as a \u20181\u2019 or \u20180\u2019 depending on its presence or absence. Alternatively, a more flexible approach is to enumerate through fragments up to a certain size. This enumeration can be path-based as in Fig. 4, where a connectivity of up to three has been included (e.g. Daylight fingerprint) [87], or circular by considering the environment of an atom by its \u2018radius\u2019 or \u2018diameter\u2019 (e.g. extended-connectivity fingerprints) [88]. To standardise between different sized molecules, these fragments are converted into a bit vector using a hashing function. The hashing function converts the fingerprint from an arbitrary length to a fixed length. There are numerous other types of fingerprint, such as 3D pharmacophore fingerprints [89], not covered in this overview. Fingerprints are easy to use for molecular similarity and substructure searching using a variety of similarity coefficients and distances. As the fingerprints do not encode the full structure of a molecule, they cannot be easily converted back to the full structure. Fig. 4 visualises the overall procedure using a phosphine, PHMeBut, which has been used (in its BH3 protected form) for chiral ligand synthesis [90]. 3.4 Machine learning methods ML models have a trade-off between bias and variance [1]. Bias is the systematic error within the ML model itself and can be defined as how well the model matches the training data. A highly biased model may be too general, not fitting the data particularly well, and low bias refers to a near perfect fit. The variance assesses the difference in fit between different portions within the training data: if the fits for all portions are similar then the model is said to have low variance. However, if they are wildly different the model is considered to be overfitted, especially if the performance on unseen test data is poor. This normally occurs when there are too few instances for the number of descriptors used (although there is no consensus on the number of instances per descriptor) [91,92]. A good model is one with low bias (sensitive to training data), and low variance (performs well with new data). However, there is often a trade-off between bias and variance to get the most suitable model. There is often no clear way of determining which ML method to apply to a dataset up front. Almost every ML method has been applied to homogeneous ligand catalysis (see subsequent examples) and the choice of method depends on the structure and type of input data and the amount of training data. Usually, neural networks are preferred for large datasets with SMILES or graph inputs [93,94]. In practice, many machine learning methods will be trialled for a given dataset, and the best method retained. 3.4.1 Model performance analysis Various metrics to evaluate the performance of ML algorithms allowing analyses of their predictive capability, tuning and optimisation of their parameter/hyper-parameter settings, and comparison of different ML models. It is useful here to use the toy problem of Scheme 1 where a classification problem requires identification of which ligands give active or inactive catalysts. For the following discussion several definitions are required. In this example, positive, denotes that the catalyst is active and negative that the catalyst is inactive. A commonly used metric for evaluating a classification model is accuracy, indicating the fraction of correct predictions out of the total made. It is an indication of the overall accuracy of the model but may be affected by the number of each class in the dataset. Suppose a dataset with 90 active catalysts and 10 inactive catalysts. A (very poor) model which assigns all as active would give an accuracy of 90%, which is misleading. (4) Accuracy = Number of correct predictions Total predictions made Precision is the ratio of true positives and total positive predictions. This indicates how good the model is at positive predictions (active catalyst predictions). In the above example the model would also have 90% precision. (5) Precision = TPs TPs + FPs Recall or sensitivity is the ratio of true positives and total positives in the dataset [95]. This indicates how good the model is at identifying positive examples (active catalysts). In the above example the model would have 100% recall since all active catalysts were assigned as positive. (6) Recall = TPs TPs + FNs Specificity is the ratio of true negative predictions and total negatives in the dataset [95]. In the above example, the model would have a specificity of 0% since no inactive catalyst was correctly identified. Thus, it is crucial to calculate multiple metrics to get the true assessment of a model. (7) Specificity = TNs TNs + FPs Fall-out rate and miss rate are other statistics describing the false positive and false negative rates respectively. These, and more advanced statistics such as F1 score and the \u201cArea Under the Curve\u201d (AUC), are not covered here. For a regression problem, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the prediction is a well-established measure of success. It is defined as the square-root of the sum of the difference between the real and (y) predicted (\u0177) values, squared and divided by n, the total number of instances. The mean absolute error (MAE) provides information on the likely error in each prediction. It is defined as the sum of the difference between the absolute values divided by the number of instances. (8) RMSE = \u2211 i n y i \u2212 y \u02c6 i 2 n (9) MAE = \u2211 i n y i \u2212 y \u02c6 i n Outliers adversely affect these metrics, since they are based on the mean. Therefore, careful analysis of the errors is required. The standard deviation of the target variable can be compared to the average error to give an assessment of the predictive power of the model. If the error is less than the standard deviation the model is performing better than a na\u00efve assignment of the mean target variable to the test set [96]. ML methods should be compared based on an appropriate metric using an appropriate statistical test, which can establish whether one prediction is significantly better than another. The statistical tests usually define a null hypothesis that the results of two predictions for different ML models are not significantly different and, based on the outcome of the test, the hypothesis is either accepted or rejected. For details of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, we direct readers to the following references [97\u201399]. Some selected common ML methods used for regression and classification are covered in the following sections. 3.4.2 Linear regression This simple method assesses the correlation between a descriptor and the target variable using a line of best fit. The line is fitted using the least squares method, where the sum of the squares of the residuals (SSR) is minimised. The equation of the line is given as: (10) y = mx + c where y is the target variable, x is the descriptor, and m and c (the gradient and intercept) are optimised by the model. This line minimises the vertical distance between each of the points from the real data and the fitted line. For multidimensional problems, multilinear regression (MLR) [100] using the same technique is applied, but with as many coefficients as descriptors to describe the associated hyperplane. For a dataset with two descriptors, x 1 and x 2, and the target variable, y, the equation of the hyperplane would be: (11) y = a x 1 + b x 2 + c The coefficients a and b describe how positively or negatively that the associated descriptors contribute to the prediction and to what extent. The fitted coefficients allow easy analysis of the contributions of each descriptor, giving highly interpretable models. MLR cannot deal with many collinear (correlated) descriptors. However, dimension reduction can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset (see previous section on PCA and PLS). Additionally, non-linear relationships cannot be modelled, so MLR may not be suitable for more complicated relationships. Due to its transparency, MLR is still popular for machine learning for homogeneous catalysis, especially for smaller datasets [101]. However, one of the more advanced methods described in the subsequent sections typically outperforms MLR for larger datasets, as seen in the majority of case studies presented in Section 4. For a case study using this model see Section 4.1. 3.4.3 Decision trees This method [102] encodes a series of binary choices to make decisions and classify the inputs into ever similar groupings. They are able to handle a wide range of data types such as binary, numeric, ranked and even multiple-choice data in a single tree. Trees begin with a root node. The root is defined as the descriptor that contributes greatest variability to the target variable and is determined by calculating an impurity score: a measurement of the probability that a classification will be incorrect. This same process is followed to define the internal nodes and finally the leaf nodes where the prediction is made. A decision tree is shown in Fig. 5 for the Crabtree catalyst exemplar problem described in Scheme 1. Data are partitioned according to the presence of Ir and descriptor values. Given new complex 7 (Scheme 1), the relevant descriptor values could be used to make a prediction. Fig. 5 would therefore predict a high relative rate of 5000 for complex 7. An important consideration is the maximum depth of the tree. In Fig. 5, due to the small descriptor space, the maximum possible depth has been reached where each instance has been separated into its own leaf node. A single decision tree is rarely used in machine learning since the error is typically too high. Instead, an ensemble of decision trees, known as a forest, can be used. 3.4.4 Random forest This powerful ensemble method [103,104] combines many individual decision trees to make a prediction based on the aggregated results. The random forest algorithm provides a number of benefits, including: (i) mitigation of overfitting through the use of multiple decision trees for prediction, (ii) higher accuracy, (iii) ability to handle large and/or high dimensional data, and (iv) estimate missing data maintaining accuracy [105]. The \u2018random\u2019 factor in this approach is a consequence of how the decision forest is grown. Firstly, only a randomly chosen subset of instances are used to grow each tree. Secondly, rather than using all descriptors at each decision point (node), only a random subset of descriptors is used. These steps are repeated hundreds of times until a forest of decision trees (of differing predictive ability) has been grown. Predictions are made using every tree in the forest and these predictions are aggregated. A new instance to be predicted is applied to every tree and the prediction is a combination of the entire forest. The aggregation of many results often gives the best prediction with low variance (c.f. the \u2018wisdom of crowds\u2019). Depending on the type of data, the aggregation can be done using a voting system for categorical data or by taking the average for continuous data. Random forests have several hyper-parameters including the minimum sample size and maximum depth. The minimum sample size is the minimum number of samples required to make a split. Typically, the tree is grown to until all terminal nodes contain less than the minimum sample size. This is the tree depth. Additionally, the number of trees in the forest can be varied. Although default hyperparameters generally give good predictive models, they can be optimised to make them even better [106,107]. An additional benefit is that the relative importance of each descriptor can be estimated. This makes the models more interpretable since highly weighted descriptors could give insight into the catalysis system under study. Due to their ease of use and relative insensitivity to hyper-parameters, random forest is a popular method for machine learning in homogeneous catalysis [37,108]. For a case study using this model see Section 4.2. 3.4.5 k-nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) In this method [109] all inputs, including the descriptor values and labels, of the instances for training are stored. For classification, when an unseen instance is fed into k-NN as a new input, the algorithm returns the class label which is the most frequent among the k nearest training instances to that input based on a distance metric as illustrated in Fig. 6. A commonly used metric is the Euclidean distance for measuring the pair-wise proximity of the instances in the descriptor space. Similarly, for regression, k-NN returns the average value of k nearest neighbours. Since k-NN makes predictions based on a distance metric, normalising/standardising the data is crucial. The simplistic nature of the algorithm may make k-NN unsuitable for datasets with a large number of descriptors. Each descriptor is necessarily treated with equal weight in the distance measurement. Therefore, unbalanced descriptor sets may give predictions based on the dominant features represented (e.g., too many ligand descriptors rather than metal descriptors). In addition, k-NN is poor at extrapolation, since predictions are based directly on distance to known training examples. For these reasons, there are limited cases of k-NN used for homogeneous catalysis datasets but they have been used in combination with other methods [109]. Much like MLR, k-NN excels in its simplicity and transparency. It can also be used as a benchmark to compare more complicated ML methods to assess the utility of these models [110]. Lastly, there are several modifications to k-NN, which can increase its accuracy. We refer readers to the following reference [111]. 3.4.6 Support vector machines (SVMs) An SVM works by dissecting data using a hyperplane which lies in the centre of two margins defined by the support vector classifiers [112,113]. Kernel functions are used to transform non-linear data so a linear separation may be found, as shown in Fig. 7. Kernels, functions that compare instances to each other, are used to find patterns at a higher dimension than the data naturally allows. A kernel function, K(a,b), works by calculating the dot product of two instances, a and b, essentially the magnitude and direction between the vectors derived from the instances. Taking the polynomial kernel as an example where d is the degree of the polynomial and r as the coefficient, if r = \u00bd and d = 2: (12) K a , b = ab + 1 2 2 = ab + 1 2 ab + 1 2 = ab + a 2 b 2 + 1 4 = a , a 2 , 1 2 . b , b 2 , 1 2 The dot product indicates the relationship between two instances by providing the coordinates of them in 2D space so defining the position of each instance relative to all others. The kernel trick (Fig. 7) is this principle: analysing the data as if it were in higher dimensional space rather than performing the actual transformation in order to define a hyperplane. The margin can vary in \u2018hardness\u2019 depending on the separability of the data: a soft margin accommodates some misclassifications, but a hard margin has no tolerance. To increase the bias and reduce the variance, a soft margin is preferable to the instances that lie in this region; these instances are categorised as the support vectors. This can be applied to a 1D linear dataset where the threshold and support vector classifiers are simply points on a line, and can be extended to n-dimensional data, where hyperplanes are defined by n-1 dimensions. For non-linear data where no single threshold can be defined, an SVM can use a kernel to effectively transform the instances onto higher dimensions until a single hyperplane can be fitted. Kernels are functions that output a similarity matrix containing values for every instance compared to every other instance in the dataset. Computational costs are kept low by avoiding the transformation and instead providing the similarity matrix. As with all these methods, it must be refined to suit the dataset. Various kernels are available, such as the radial basis function, which behaves like a weighted nearest neighbours model, clustering based on the proximity of other instances. The computational power of individual kernels is nominally dependent on the dataset. However, to systematically find the best kernel and optimise the hyper-parameters for each takes time, as models are highly dependent on the hyper-parameters used. In fact, it is challenging to optimise the hyper-parameters even when the kernel is fixed to be the radial basis function [114]. SVMs are suitable for the small and medium size datasets typically seen in chemistry [115,116]. However, a disadvantage to SVM is that the computational time to select the support vectors and construct the hyperplane increases exponentially as the training data size increases [117]. For a case study example of use of this model see Section 4.2. 3.4.7 Neural networks: from perceptron to deep learning Inspired by early attempts mimic the activity of neurons of human brains, these use multiple decision layers connected by binary switching functions [118]. Neural networks are computationally expensive and time consuming to train and result in predictive logic that is often opaque to human comprehension and tricky to rationalise. However, with enough time and data they can provide highly accurate results. The artificial neuron (node) is a simple computational unit which processes input values, taking the weighted sum of input values, transforming/scaling that sum through a non-linear function mapping to an output value. The perceptron is the simplest neural network architecture that employs supervised learning for binary classification. Fig. 8 illustrates a single layer perceptron that is composed of multiple input neurons passing on the input signal/values directly and a single neuron in the output layer. Each connection between neurons carries a weight (corresponding to synapses in the biological analogy, e.g., w 1 , w 2 , \u2026, w n ). The weighted sum of the input values received from the preceding input layer, including any bias function, b, is fed into the activation function. The activation function decides whether a neuron fires or not. Usually a step function (Eq. 13) is used as an activation function which ensures that the output is either 1 (indicating firing of a neuron) or 0. The bias, b, in the activation function adjusts the threshold away from origin. (13) f x = 1 , if \u2211 i = 1 n w i x i + b > 0 0 , otherwise During the training, optimal weight coefficients are computed automatically using the learning algorithm which iteratively compares the output to the predicted output propagating the error back and updating the weights until that error reduces to a satisfactory level. One of the simpler types of neural networks is the multi-layer perceptron (see Fig. 9). There are several layers of nodes: input, output, and hidden; there may be many hidden layers. In the fully connected version, each neuron (node) in one layer is connected to every other neuron in the next layer. The weights and biases of the connections in the neural network are updated by the back-propagation of errors algorithm [119], where a network is iteratively updated by running training data forward through the model, then updating the weights to minimise the overall error. The hyper-parameters of a neural network include the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons (nodes) in each hidden layer. There is not an obvious way to decide the optimal number of hidden layers and nodes, which can lead to under- or over-fitting. However, there are several guides on network architecture [120]. Large neural networks may also require long training times or specialist hardware (e.g., GPUs) for large datasets. Although the advent of tools such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have made neural networks more accessible, there is still a significant barrier, not least due to the sheer number of options available, for new users. Neural networks have gained popularity due to their ability to model complex and non-linear relationships. There is a vast range of neural networks with diverse architectures. Readers are directed to literature on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [121], Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for chemistry problems as they have had notable success, especially with language-based models (e.g., SMILES input) and molecular graph inputs [93,94]. Molecular graph inputs have the potential to highlight atoms or bonds in the molecule which were important for the prediction. This can be used to verify the model is learning form the correct part of the molecule and to give insight into important structural features in the molecule [122]. We also refer readers to the following studies using neural networks in homogeneous catalysis prediction [123,124]. 3.5 Toolkits and useful resources Table 4 summarises some useful resources for ML, including some that are designed for the researcher with limited ML experience. We do not comment further here as extensive documentation and resources for these software sources are already widely available. 4 Case studies 4.1 Prediction of enantioselectivity in asymmetric catalysis using multiple linear regression Binaphthylphosphoric acids, such as L C -H, are strong activators of imines (8). Once protonated by acid, the resultant electrophilic iminiums (9) are readily attacked by a variety of nucleophiles (Nu-H = alcohols, thiols, phosphites, diazomethylphosphonates, diazoacetamides, hyperperoxides, Hantzsch esters, benzothizaolines and enecarbamates) the stereochemical outcome of which (Re or Si face addition of Nu-H) is controlled by L C . Reid and Sigman [101] postulated that known literature results for families of these additions could be parameterised allowing the performance of future unknown systems to be predicted. A dataset of 367 literature reactions was compiled. Categorising this by imine (E) or (Z) geometry allows insight into transition states associated with 9 as they give opposite absolute stereochemistry in the product amines. The authors arbitrarily assigned positive %ee values to reactions starting from (E)-geometry, and negative for (Z)-imines across all examples used to ensure consistent behaviour. Molecular descriptors derived from DFT calculations were collected to describe the nucleophiles and catalysts that contained shared structural features. These DFT derived descriptors included: frontier orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO) and important bond angles and bond lengths amongst others. Whilst the nucleophiles and catalysts in the training set have many common structural elements, the solvents used vary significantly in the data set. This needed additional parameterisation as the solvent used significantly affects the enantioselectivity of these reactions. In order to overcome this problem, a variety of 2D solvent descriptors were used including: molecular shape representation, size and number of heteroatoms present. Finally, categorical descriptors were added including reagent concentrations. First, the key descriptors critical for highly enantioselective reactions were found. Linear regression was used to detect correlations between the experimentally observed enantioselectivity and combinations of the descriptors identified above. Cross-validation techniques (leave-one-out and k-fold) and external validation led to an acceptable linear regression model (R 2 = 0.88). The resultant regression equation indicated that the main descriptor contributors are associated with the imine and the nucleophile, while the solvent and catalyst have a much less significant impact (Eq. 14). The equation coefficients are normalised to demonstrate the relative importance of each descriptor. This exemplifies an advantage of multiple linear regression and adds interpretability to the model as the magnitude and sign of each descriptor in the equation can be used to give insight into the importance and effect of the descriptors. While it would have been interesting to see if more complex ML methods could build a better model; the small size of dataset may have precluded their use. (14) \u2206 \u2206 G \u2260 = 0.42 + 0.29 sol \u2212 0.90 NBO N \u2212 0.75 NBO C + 0.33 L s + 0.63 H \u2212 X \u2212 CNU + 0.20 L cat In Eq. 14: sol = solvent term (i.e. describing the positive impact of using aromatic solvent), NBON and NBOC = imine natural bond orbital descriptors [which capture features of the imine that determine its transition state type pathway, different of (E) and (Z) imines], Ls = a steric descriptor of smallest imine, H-X-CNU = a discovered critical bond angle, Lcat = length of catalyst substituent on Ar group (i.e., a measure of its size). In order to develop the simple model shown in Eq. 14 further, the dataset was split into (E)- and (Z)-imine derived transition states. A similar linear regression workflow was used (correlation between the experimentally observed %ee values and the now geometrically specific molecular structure descriptors). This analysis implied that for (E)-imines an energy minimising conformation that avoids repulsive interactions with large catalyst substituents is attained. Higher enantioselectivity is associated with large imine and catalyst substituents. However, for (Z)-imines enantiofacial selectivity the model was dominated by the nucleophile steric descriptor (larger nucleophiles correlate to higher product %ee). The validity of the transition state models was tested using motifs not included in the original training set. Three approaches were used. Firstly, the initial [fit to both (E) and (Z) data] model was tested using a nucleophile not included in the initial training. Of the 15 new reactions sampled, 13 were predicted within 5% of the observed %ee. Using an (E)-imine model alone, all reactions were predicted to the same \u00b1 5%ee error bar. Secondly, the (Z)-imine model was tested on both a nucleophile and catalyst not contained in the original dataset. While 13 reactions were predicted a correct %ee value ( \u00b1 2%ee), the model performed poorly in predicting the absolute stereochemistry. In a final test of their approach, they focussed on the addition of thiols to benzoyl imines (following the work of Zahrt et al.[125]) All reactions of this type were removed, and the model was retrained accordingly. The initial [(E) and (Z) data] model still predicted the enantioselectivity (%ee) of 26 out of 34 reactions within 5%. In the case of (E)-imines the correct absolute stereochemistry was predicted in 25 cases. The advantage of the Reid and Sigman approach is that using multiple linear regression associated to a range of \u2018simple\u2019 models, allows the data to be more easily interpreted. 4.2 Predictions of higher-selectivity catalysts for chiral phosphoric acid\u2013catalyzed thiol additions Zarht et al. [125] also adopted a data-driven process for the development of novel catalysts for chiral phosphoric acid\u2013catalyzed thiol additions to N-acylimines in a similar manner to Scheme 4. Their workflow comprised: development of an in silico library, calculation of descriptors, selection of a representative subset of the catalysts, training data, and use of SVM, random forest and neural network methods to predict reaction enantioselectivity (%ee). Most significantly a new average steric occupancy (ASO) descriptor was developed. ASO simplifies the number of conformers into a numerical form based on location by conflating conformers if they are within a defined van der Waals radius allowing improved computational efficiency. Electronic descriptors were generated through calculated interactions with a quaternary ammonium ion. This study demonstrated the importance of descriptor selection as they had a very large number of descriptors (16,384). This was reduced by removing any descriptors with a variance of zero since they do not add any information to the model. Then PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the descriptor space. ML training was initiated on a previously optimised reaction (enantioselective formation of N,S-acetals), with a training set of 600 and a test set of 475 reactions. Overall, an SVM approach was found to be the most effective method for catalyst selectivity prediction for randomly selected train and test sets. It is possible SVM was the best machine learning method at finding trends in the large input space used in this study, though it should be noted that often multiple machine learning approaches should be compared to get the most accurate model. Catalyst performance was measured by comparing predicted vs. observed \u0394\u0394G \u2021 (kcal mol-1) values. The model predicted enantioselectivity within 0.3\u20130.4 kcal mol-1. The most accurately modelled catalyst had predicted %ee within 1\u20132% of the experimental %ee. 4.3 A unified ML protocol for asymmetric catalysis as a proof of concept demonstration using asymmetric hydrogenation Singh et al. [126] applied random forest to predict the outcome of asymmetric hydrogenation. An in silico library of 386 asymmetric hydrogenation reactions was built, with five catalyst families based on an (S) axially chiral binaphthyl ligands. The five families chosen were: 1. mono-BINOL-phosphites (LD), 2. BINOL-phosphoramidites (L E ), 3. BINAP derivatives (L F ), 4. bis-BINOL-phosphites (L G ) and 5. BINOL-phosphoric acids (L H -H) ( Scheme 5). They selected a broad number of descriptors for each substrate and catalyst. The catalysts were typically ruthenium(II) or rhodium(I) complexes of the ligands of Scheme 5. As the catalysis is ligand controlled, 22 global descriptors represented overall molecular properties of the general ligand, e.g., HOMO, LUMO, polar surface area and dipole moment. Eight site-specific descriptors represented differences arising from substituents. These descriptors included: bond length and angles, vibrational frequencies and intensities, NMR chemical shifts, atomic charges, and distance between nonbonded atoms. The ML model was developed to predict the hydrogenation product %ee value as a function of ligand. A random forest model was built using 20% of the instances for the test set and 80% of instances for the training set. To ensure that the model was sufficiently rigorous, 100 test-train sets were used, each produced by random selection and five-fold cross validation. These test-train sets were performed to identify the best \u201chyper-parameter selection\u201d. Using these hyper-parameters the average performance of the 100 test-train sets was measured and then compared with experimental data of the test set. For each of the five catalyst families an independent random forest model was constructed. For example, in the mono-BINOL-phosphite catalyst family (L D ) only relevant reactions were incorporated into the test train sets. The outcome of this was five models with an RMSE of 5.4% for the %ee and a demonstration of the model\u2019s ability to decipher the relationships between the descriptors, the enantioselectivity and the substrate-catalyst combinations. A unified random forest model was created by first combining the data sets from families 1 (L D ) and 2 (L E ) and training a random forest model on this set. The predicted %ee had an RMSE of 8.5% with respect to the experimental %ee. This was further developed by adding the data set for the fifth catalyst family (L H -H); which had an RMSE of 6.8%. In the final model all 368 reactions were used and showed an RMSE of 8.4%. This model was also tested on varying sizes of data set with RMSEs less than 10 for data sets from 39 reactions to 386 reactions. The random forest model was compared with other commonly used ML techniques such as convolutional neural networks and extreme gradient boosting which showed RMSEs of 9.6% and 11.6% compared to the random forest RMSE of 9.2%. It is likely that the relatively small size of the dataset made random forest a better choice than a neural network. Additionally, random forest made the subsequent analysis of descriptor important easier, adding interpretability to the model. The final part of this work was to identify chemical patterns using decision trees with the rationale of discovering how variations in the molecular descriptors can be used to fine tune %ee. This was achieved by having 20% of the data set as holdout (data excluded from the model on which to test the model) in each run. In total 100 runs were performed where in each one a critical descriptor was varied and at the end the best decision tree was selected. In this particular case vibrational intensities, dihedral angles, bond angles, dipole moments and volume were identified as key descriptors. This information is potentially useful in designing later ML-improved ligand candidates, a concept explored in the next example. 4.4 Retooling asymmetric conjugate additions for sterically demanding substrates with an iterative data-driven approach The asymmetric conjugate addition (ACA) of zirconium organometallics (specifically Cp2ZrCl(CH2)4Ph) to enones 10 generates the useful chiral ketones 11 [127]. This procedure had a limitation that branched substituents \u2018R\u2019 provided only low levels of enantioselectivity ( Scheme 6, typically %ee values over 90% are required for onward synthetic use of 11). Preliminary studies had already shown that the binaphthol and indane units of L I were already close to optimal, but the effect of the isopropyl region of ligand space on the reaction %ee was not clear. Nine ligands (L J -L R ), differing only at the isopropyl substituent position, were synthesised and simultaneously descriptors for their substituents alone, the ligands themselves and their Cu(I) complexes were generated using DFT obtained geometries ( Scheme 7). Sub-sets of six ligands at a time were used to discover correlations of the difference in \u0394G \u2021 (directly related to the %ee of 12) to these descriptors (or combinations thereof). Three instructive facts are uncovered in this process. Firstly, regression fits of a single input are preferred, as with only six instances (ligands), overfitting of the data becomes a common problem. Secondly, due to limited instances regression fit of ensembles of conformational geometry and steric descriptors (ex. DFT/Sterimol) did not proceed well. However, acceptable (R 2 test >0.6, RMSE(\u0394\u0394G \u2021)test < 2 kJmol-1) forward correlation to the substituent lipophilicity (logP) descriptor was found. This allowed guided prediction that L S and L T (higher logP) would provide higher %ee in ACA reactions yielding 12. Both L S and L T were human (as opposed to ML) designed and synthesised. A third important fact is that simply predicting the \u2018best\u2019 ligand in the absence of understanding the confidence/error in the regression analysis is a poor strategy. The regression of Scheme 7 suggests L T to be the best ligand but is of significant uncertainty compared to the predicted L S %ee value. In fact, their true experimental performance is actually reversed by a \u0394\u0394G \u2021 obs of \u223c1 kJmol-1 (94 vs. 92% ee for 12 using L S compared to L T ). Keeping track of the confidence bounds in ML predictions is, thus, very important. The model of Scheme 7 was unable to provide insight into the exact ligand structural features required to maximise the %ee of 12. For example, additional ligand candidates with high logP delivered slightly poorer experimental ee, while a simple CHEt2 substituent provided the same enantioselectivity as L T in the lab, despite having a much lower calculated logP value. In order to address these deviations a significant number of additional ligand instances (22 synthesised and 20 \u2018computed only\u2019 structures) were added to the data pool in a stepwise manner. This allowed improved regression analyses and an improved (higher confidence level) model using a combination of the ligand EHOMO and minimum energy conformation dipole moment descriptors to be developed. However, this came at the cost of a significant increase in DFT conformational analysis power/time required. While no further gains in ACA %ee performance were attained, importantly this second model allowed the identification of a gauche conformation in CH(n-alkyl)2 substituents as being critical to attaining high stereoselectivity. Finally, it also indicated that further ligand development of this ligand feature would not be profitable, as the system had \u2018topped out\u2019 at 94%ee. 4.5 Machine learnt patterns in rhodium-catalysed asymmetric Michael addition using chiral diene ligands Rhodium-catalysed asymmetric 1,4-addition of organoboron reagents to Michael acceptors is a frequently used methodology where high levels of enantioselectivity is often obtained [128]. The reaction compromises of an enone substrate (i.e., an alkene with an electron-withdrawing group), a chiral diene ligand to direct the stereochemistry, and an organoboron reagent. Hayashi proposed a steric-dominated selectivity model [128]. However, this does not take into account electronic considerations, known to be important in the rate-determining step of this reaction. DFT models have also been built for this reaction, but this can be time-consuming if several transition states must be found. Thus, a simple supervised ML regression model was built to predict the \u2018%top\u2019 product formed [129]. This metric was chosen instead of the typical R/S stereochemistry classification since R/S is based on R-group atoms and molecular weights. The metric \u2018%top\u2019 was defined relative to the electron withdrawing group in the enone, making it suitable for ML. Scheme 8 shows the reaction and ML workflow. This study highlighted the \u201cblack-box\u201d problem in synthetic chemistry, where ML models are perceived as opaque and overly complicated. Therefore, an interpretable ML model was built which could enhance the chemist\u2019s understanding of the reaction. The enone, chiral diene ligand, and organoboron reagent were featurised into a small number of descriptors which were known to be important, according to the current understanding of the reaction. These features were volumes and Hammett constants of the R1-R7 groups on the chiral diene ligand, volume of the organoboron residue, and stoutness (volume/longest chain length) of the substrate R1-R4 groups. From a collection of 4303 examples, 610 reactions were curated. These data were split into training and test data (in a 9:1 ratio) and 5-fold cross validation was run on the training data. A total of 30 random test-train splits were performed to get mean predictions with their standard deviations (as a measure of error). ML models were built with Random Forest, Multiple Linear Regression, and Gradient Boosted Regression [130] (an ensemble method like Random Forest). All the ensemble methods gave comparable results and outperformed Multiple Linear Regression, showing the power of ensemble methods, even for a modestly sized dataset. The models gave a lowest RMSE of 9% and R 2 of 0.7\u20130.8, comparable to models built using 11514 DRAGON descriptors or molecular signatures (fragment-based). The performance of the DRAGON model, in contrast to the main model in the paper, was significantly worse on the test data than training data. This indicated overfitting, most likely due to the large number of descriptors. Another advantage of the main model was high levels of interpretability. The importance of the descriptors was ranked and both steric and electronic descriptors were weighted highly. Additionally, this model was better than the DRAGON model at identifying outliers by analysing which examples were poorly predicted; these outliers were indicated by high standard deviation (variation between models built with different samples of the training data). Therefore, due to the interpretability of this model, this methodology could allow identification of promising de novo ligands for asymmetric organic synthesis. 4.6 Machine learning directs design of Cr olefin oligomerisation catalysts Short chain linear olefins, such as 1-hexene and 1-octene, are important in the manufacture of several important products such as plasticisers and lubricants. A study was devised to combine quantum mechanical transition states with machine learning to design new catalysts which could selectively produce 1-octene from ethylene [108]. Most interestingly, the primary aim of the study was not to predict selectivity but to determine which descriptors were most important and use those descriptors to design new catalysts. The system under study was Cr and 105 unique phosphine imine P,N ligands. Transition state energies for the two different transition states to form 1-hexene and 1-octene were determined using DFT. The resultant structures were used to calculate 14 atomic and molecular descriptors. These included geometric features such as bond lengths and angles, percent volume buried, and distance out of pocket.Percent volume buried described the extent to which the first coordination sphere of the Cr metal centre is occupied by a P,N ligand. The distance out of pocket describes the how far the Cr metal is situated from the P,N ligand. Using these descriptors, several machine learning methods, including random forest and SVM, were used to predict the energy difference between the two competing transition states. They found that random forest gave the best models. Although the authors do not explain why random forest gave the best model, they note, as we do, the success and versatility of the method for small dataset homogeneous catalysis systems. Random forest gave the lowest RMSE and correctly predicted the overall selectivity for 83 out of 105 ligands. They note the skew in their dataset as more of the ligands were 1-octene selectivity, and posit a more balanced dataset could have enhanced the predictions. The random forest model was interpreted by determining the descriptor importance. Three important descriptors were identified: Cr-N distance; Cr-\u03b1 distance; and distance out of pocket. This led to the generation of seven new ligands by modifying ligands to change these important descriptor values. When experimentally verified, the newly designed catalysts gave > 95% 1-octene selectivity. 5 Conclusion This overview aimed to demonstrate that ML algorithms are a valuable ally to the synthetic researcher, and more accessible than at first appearance. We hope the contents of this article will prompt further collaboration between the chemical and computational sciences in furthering the field of ML in chemistry. Under the umbrella of \u201cMachine Learning in Ligand Promoted Catalysis\u201d work that has been achieved by researchers includes: rapid virtual catalyst screening; significant improvements molecular descriptors; development of successful novel ligands (and enzymes); enhanced mechanistic understanding or elucidation; improved enantioinduction; generally focussed on a modest \u2018area\u2019 of catalytic reaction space; prediction of reaction or reactant types not supplied to the algorithm in the training set; and acceleration of traditional empirical catalyst discovery methods. Areas where we expect further development in the near or more distant future include: greater need for consistent format in published ML literature and consistent use of nomenclature across the catalysis-informatics divide; text- and image-mining for reaction and catalyst data stored in text, tables and schemes; faster quantum chemistry calculations to guide predictive models; need for the practicing chemist to have basic knowledge of ML methods; increased publication of \u2018failed\u2019 experiments to decrease database bias; alternative ways to model the surface of the catalytic pocket; identification of species in microscopic and spectroscopic analysis by ML; and increasing use of explainable and interpretable AI, to provide models which chemists trust and add to the knowledge of catalytic systems. As the popularity of ML increases, coupled with the improvements in computational power, the potential in chemistry could result in a whole new way of experimentation and add another tool to the chemists\u2019 toolkit. However, one thing is clear: chemists should be encouraged to engage with the process of developing AI and ML in chemistry, and in educating the next generation of scientists as the field evolves.

We aimed to summarise the performance of such prognostic models for COPD, compare their relative performances, and identify key research gaps. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the performance of machine learning and deep learning prognostic models and identify pathways for future research. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science from database inception to April 6, 2023, for studies in English using machine learning or deep learning to predict patient outcomes at least 6 months after initial clinical presentation in those with COPD. We included studies comprising human adults aged 18\u201390 years and allowed for any input modalities. We reported area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% CI for predictions of mortality, exacerbation, and decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). We reported the degree of interstudy heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test (significant heterogeneity was defined as p\u22640\u00b710 or I 2>50%). Reporting quality was assessed using the TRIPOD checklist and a risk-of-bias assessment was done using the PROBAST checklist. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022323052). Findings We identified 3620 studies in the initial search. 18 studies were eligible, and, of these, 12 used conventional machine learning and six used deep learning models. Seven models analysed exacerbation risk, with only six reporting AUC and 95% CI on internal validation datasets (pooled AUC 0\u00b777 [95% CI 0\u00b769\u20130\u00b785]) and there was significant heterogeneity (I 2 97%, p<0\u00b70001). 11 models analysed mortality risk, with only six reporting AUC and 95% CI on internal validation datasets (pooled AUC 0\u00b777 [95% CI 0\u00b774\u20130\u00b780]) with significant degrees of heterogeneity (I 2 60%, p=0\u00b7027). Two studies assessed decline in lung function and were unable to be pooled. Machine learning and deep learning models did not show significant improvement over pre-existing disease severity scores in predicting exacerbations (p=0\u00b724). Three studies directly compared machine learning models against pre-existing severity scores for predicting mortality and pooled performance did not differ (p=0\u00b757). Of the five studies that performed external validation, performance was worse than or equal to regression models. Incorrect handling of missing data, not reporting model uncertainty, and use of datasets that were too small relative to the number of predictive features included provided the largest risks of bias. Interpretation There is limited evidence that conventional machine learning and deep learning prognostic models demonstrate superior performance to pre-existing disease severity scores. More rigorous adherence to reporting guidelines would reduce the risk of bias in future studies and aid study reproducibility. Funding None. Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death globally. 1 The costs of COPD management are likely to continue to increase worldwide 2,3 and the identification of patients who might have rapid disease progression would be highly beneficial for reducing these costs. These patients could then be given more intensive treatment and follow-up, maximising the efficiency of health service delivery. Several measures\u2014including lung function tests, questionnaires, exercise capacity, and exacerbation frequency\u2014can be used to assess the risk of poor patient outcomes, with composite prognostic models, such as the body-mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, and exercise capacity [BODE] index, providing better predictive performance than any single variable. 2 A comprehensive systematic review by Bellou and colleagues 4 in 2019 identified more than 400 published prognostic models for the prediction of clinical outcomes in COPD. Meta-analysis of linear regression models (n=12) and their pooled C-statistics\u2014a measure of predictive performance, equivalent to the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) 5 \u2014for predicting mortality ranged between 0\u00b7624 and 0\u00b7769. These results reflect that regression models have only a moderate predictive ability and little clinical effect on COPD prognosis. 6 Research in context Evidence before this study Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide with a high degree of heterogeneity in disease progression that conventional prognostic scores have not been able to account for. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify reviews of long-term COPD prognostic models published in English between Jan 1, 2016, to March 29, 2022, using search terms related to \u201cCOPD\u201d, \u201cmachine learning\u201d, and \u201cprediction\u201d. Two systematic reviews of COPD prognostic models reported low rates of methodological rigour and model validation, which were also unfit for clinical use. Neither systematic review compared the performance or merits of machine learning models relative to conventional regression models. A qualitative review describing the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning models in different clinical contexts for COPD observed a considerable increase in the availability of large datasets with complex data, enabling the broader adoption of artificial intelligence techniques in the clinical context. Added value of this study To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reviews of prognostic models for COPD outcomes using and comparing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Our assessment provides a baseline for machine learning model performance and highlights the current limitations in both methodology and study reporting quality, which must be overcome to make further improvements in this field. Implications of all the available evidence Moving forward, researchers developing machine learning algorithms need to pay close attention to the guidelines provided in PROBAST and TRIPOD to ensure results are meaningfully reported and studies have low risk of bias. Clinical relevance for conventional machine learning models analysing tabular clinical data is currently limited due to the number of variables required for assessment. In contrast, there are increasing opportunities for deep learning assessment of CT scans to be incorporated as an opportunistic assessment within clinical practice once further progress has been made. Based on the evidence presented within our study, we recommend further research into multimodal modelling techniques incorporating imaging and clinical measurements; the development of large, public datasets outside of North America and Europe; and the development of guidelines similar to PROBAST applicable to the deep learning context. Machine learning refers to computer algorithms in which rules and correlations between input and output data are automatically learnt from a dataset, allowing for automated inference in a hypothesis-free framework. 7 Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, employs a hierarchical structure to learn more complex structures and relationships within a dataset. 8 Deep learning is particularly powerful when applied to medical images 9 and has shown substantial promise in clinical prognostic tasks using imaging data. 10,11 There has been increasing interest in the use of deep learning to provide new prognostic and diagnostic tools for the identification of patients with COPD who are at risk of worsening outcomes, as existing statistical models have not incorporated information on the structural changes of the lungs in people with COPD, which can be demonstrated with imaging. 12 In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the performance and quality of published machine learning-based and deep learning-based prognostic models for people with COPD and to compare the performance of these models with previous predictive regression models. 4 For the purpose of evaluating the clinical usefulness of machine learning and deep learning, we focused on model performance regardless of model architecture or selected features. Methods Search strategy and selection criteria For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included studies that used a machine learning or deep learning model to predict mortality risk, exacerbation risk, or decline in lung function within a cohort of adult patients with COPD at least 6 months (or 180 days) after initial clinical presentation. Studies on animals or cohorts of people primarily younger than 18 years or older than 90 years were excluded. Prognostic studies for the development of COPD in patients who do not initially have COPD were excluded, as were prognostic studies that did not include at least 6 months of follow-up. Cohort studies (both prospective and retrospective), case-control studies, randomised controlled trials, and cross-sectional studies were all allowed. We did not limit by country of origin or publication source. We defined machine learning as algorithms (such as random forest analysis and support vector machines) that are more complicated than regression models, which can learn to make decisions based on patterns within data, and we defined deep learning as the use of neural networks with two or more hidden layers. Brief definitions of the machine learning algorithms used in the search terms and selected studies can be found in the appendix (pp 2\u20135). Full inclusion criteria using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time approach 13 are described in the appendix (pp 1\u20132). We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest using search terms related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, prediction, and prognosis, for studies published in English or with an English translation between database inception and April 6, 2023. Full search queries with all synonymous search terms for each database can be found in the appendix (pp 7\u20139). Hand searches of included study references and systematic reviews were completed to identify any missed studies. Studies were uploaded to Covidence and duplicates were removed. LAS and AB independently screened the titles and abstracts of all studies, defaulting to including studies when it was uncertain if they met inclusion criteria. Manuscripts passing initial screening were then reviewed using the full-text version by LAS and AB. Where possible, conflicts were resolved between the two reviewers, otherwise they were resolved by a third, independent reviewer (LJP). Our protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022323052) and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. 14 Data analysis Before data collection, we designed a table based on the CHARMS checklist. 15 11 data fields were extracted for each study (appendix p 10). Studies were divided into two categories: those that used deep neural networks (the deep learning group) and those that did not (the conventional machine learning group). If a study presented multiple models for the same outcome, we assessed the model with the best performance that also met the inclusion criteria. If multiple similar outcomes were reported (eg, mortality risk at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years), the outcome most comparable to other studies was included. Data were extracted by LAS and validated by AB and MZ. Disagreements were resolved by LJP. Each study was assessed using PROBAST 16 to estimate risk of bias (appendix p 10). The checklist comprised 20 questions grouped into four domains (participant selection, predictors, outcome, and analysis). During assessment, each question was answered as yes, probably yes, probably no, no, or no information, with yes indicating a low risk of bias and no indicating a high risk of bias. An answer of no or probably no on one or more questions implied that the study was at a high risk of bias, otherwise the study was coded as being at low risk of bias. We assessed reporting quality using the TRIPOD checklist, a list of 22 items deemed essential for transparent reporting of predictive model development and validation (appendix pp 11\u201312). 17 The discriminative ability of prognostic models to predict mortality, exacerbation, or decline in forced expiratory volume after 1 s (FEV1) was quantified using AUC 18 and associated 95% CIs. Hospitalisation was used as a surrogate measure for exacerbation. Decline in 6 min walk test performance, changes in dyspnoea, or changes in COPD burden, as measured by questionnaires or psychophysical scales, were used as surrogate markers for decline in FEV1, though no suitable studies were found. AUCs were pooled for each outcome, with internal validation and external validation pooled separately. We anticipated a high degree of inter-study heterogeneity among the included studies due to different models, predictors, cohorts, and outcome timeframes. Therefore, we used a random effects model to pool AUCs across studies and presented the results in forest plots. AUCs were pooled independently of model architecture or features. We reported the degree of interstudy heterogeneity using the Cochran's Q test 19 (where significant heterogeneity was defined as p\u22640\u00b710 or I 2>50%) to assess whether a fixed effects model could have been used. Meta-analyses were done using the MedCalc (20.116) statistical software. To compare pooled results of machine learning and deep learning studies against existing regression models, we pooled the model performances of regression models for mortality and exacerbation risk reported by Bellou and colleagues, 4 and used the MedCalc online calculator 20 to compare between AUCs. Additionally, where possible, we directly compared the performance of deep learning and machine learning models against the performance of conventional risk scores or linear regression models (such as the BODE index) reported on the same dataset within the study. Role of the funding source There was no funding source for this study. Results A total of 3620 studies were identified in the initial search. Following title and abstract screening, and full-text eligibility assessments, 17 studies 21\u201337 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (figure 1 ). We searched reference lists and found an additional eligible study 38 for a total of 18 studies. Studies that were considered for inclusion but rejected are described in the appendix (p 13). The basic cohort demographics for studies in each group are shown in the appendix (pp 14\u201318). Two studies predicted decline in lung function, 26,35 seven studies predicted exacerbation risk, 21,23,28,29,32,33,37 and 11 studies predicted mortality. 21\u201325,27,30,31,34,36,38 Two of the included studies predicted both exacerbations and mortality. 21,23 Summaries of study statistics reporting frequencies and median values, pooled across deep learning studies, machine learning studies, and all studies are shown in table 1 . Overall, age, sex, and location of recruitment were consistently reported in studies, but ethnicity demographics were not. All studies performed internal validation, either using a hold-out validation set or k-fold cross-validation. In comparison, external validation was only performed in four deep learning studies 21,22,24,25 and one machine learning study. 30 Of these, three studies 21,22,30 were developed using the COPDGene cohort 39 and externally validated on the ECLIPSE cohort, 40 and the other two were both developed on South Korean cohorts and externally validated on separate South Korean 24 and Malaysian 25 cohorts. Cohort demographics for COPDGene and ECLIPSE are shown in the appendix (p 19). Six studies applied deep learning to the task of COPD prognosis, 21\u201325,38 whereas 12 studies used machine learning. 26\u201337 Model development for deep learning and conventional machine learning models is summarised in the appendix (pp 20\u201323). Model performance for deep learning is summarised in table 2 and model performance for machine learning is summarised in table 3 . The pooled AUC for exacerbation prediction across machine learning and deep learning regimes on the internal validation datasets was 0\u00b777 (95% CI 0\u00b769\u20130\u00b785; figure 2 ). Examination of heterogeneity as measured using Cochran's Q test showed significant heterogeneity (I 2 97%, p<0\u00b70001). Whereas there were not enough deep learning studies predicting exacerbation to be pooled independently, there were enough studies using machine learning, and their pooled AUC was 0\u00b780 (0\u00b772\u20130\u00b787, I 2 97%, p<0\u00b70001). One study 21 performed external validation on exacerbation prediction and saw a drop in performance from AUC 0\u00b764 (95% CI 0\u00b758\u20130\u00b771) to 0\u00b755 (0\u00b751\u20130\u00b757). The pooled AUC for mortality prediction on the internal validation datasets was 0\u00b777 (95% CI 0\u00b774\u20130\u00b780), with significant heterogeneity (I 2 60%, p=0\u00b7027; figure 3 ). Individually, pooled AUC was 0\u00b778 (0\u00b773\u20130\u00b784, I 2 22%, p=0\u00b728) for deep learning studies and 0\u00b777 (0\u00b773\u20130\u00b780, I 2 80%, p=0\u00b70070) for machine learning studies. Comparison between machine learning and deep learning approaches revealed no significant differences in pooled AUCs for mortality (p=0\u00b744). Four studies 21,24,25,30 performed external validation on mortality prediction, with pooled AUC 0\u00b767 (0\u00b762\u20130\u00b772, I 2 79%, p=0\u00b70023). The pooled internal validation performance for these studies was significantly higher (p=0\u00b70049) at AUC 0\u00b776 (0\u00b772\u20130\u00b780, I 2 42%, p=0\u00b716). As only two studies reported a decline in lung function, no pooled AUC could be calculated. Decline in lung function greater than 30 mL over a 5-year period was predicted with AUC 0\u00b781 (95% CI 0\u00b766\u20130\u00b796) on a cohort of 42 patients using 5-fold cross validation, 35 and the overall decline in lung volume was predicted with AUC 0\u00b771 (0\u00b769\u20130\u00b772) on a cohort of 4496 patients using ten-fold nested cross validation (table 3). 26 The pooled prognostic performance of regression models previously reported by Bellou and colleagues 4 was 0\u00b766 (95% CI 0\u00b749\u20130\u00b782) for exacerbation prediction and 0\u00b769 (0\u00b768\u20130\u00b771) for mortality prediction. For prognosis of mortality, both machine learning (p=0\u00b70001) and deep learning (p<0\u00b70001) studies had significantly better predictive performance. For exacerbation prognosis, machine learning studies had a numerically higher pooled estimate than Bellou and colleagues, 4 but the difference was not significant (p=0\u00b714 for pooling across machine learning studies and p=0\u00b724 for pooling across all studies). A small number of studies allowed direct comparison of the performance of deep learning or machine learning models to more conventional risk scores or regression models on the same dataset. Three deep learning studies 21,23,24 compared mortality prognosis to the BODE index, two of which were conducted using the same population (COPDGene). 21,23 These studies reported marginal but non-significant improvement in AUC for mortality using deep learning versus the BODE index. There were seven machine learning studies that also reported conventional indices (BODE index, and age, dyspnoea, airflow obstruction index) or regression models using the same predictors as the machine learning models in the same dataset. 26,27,30,31,35\u201337 Five of these studies 26,27,30,35,37 reported marginally improved performance in the machine learning model, one reported no difference in performance, 31 and one reported marginally worse performance in the machine learning model. 36 Of the five studies that reported improved performance from machine learning, one study reported the improved performance to be significant. 30 Three of the seven studies 27,30,31 reported AUCs and shared an outcome (mortality) and were amenable to meta-analysis. Meta-analysis indicated no significant difference in pooled AUC between the machine learning (pooled AUC 0\u00b777) and conventional regression models (pooled AUC 0\u00b775; p=0\u00b757). Adherence to TRIPOD guidelines was good, with only one study 23 reporting less than 70% of the items (appendix p 24). 14 (78%) of 18 studies did not present or provide access to the full prediction model (item 15a) and nine (50%) of 18 studies did not report CIs with the prediction model's performance measures (item 16). All included studies were determined to be at high risk of bias according to PROBAST (appendix p 25). The analysis domain indicated a high risk of bias among all studies. Poor handling of missing data was the most frequent risk of bias (item 4.4): two studies 36,38 had no missing data, three 23,28,29 did not report handling, one 37 used a model that inherently accounts for missing data, one 34 used minimum-value imputation, and the rest used complete case analysis without justifying the missing completely at random assumption. Nine (50%) of 18 studies did not report CIs for any of their model outcomes (item 4.7). The ratio of positive outcome events to the number of predictive variables using in prognostic models, also known as the event per variable (EPV) ratio, was used to assess item 4.1, with an EPV of less than 10 indicating a high risk of bias. 41 Six (50%) of 1228,33\u201337 machine learning studies had an EPV of less than 10 in the training cohort, with a median number of positive events of 82 (IQR 33\u20131560) and median number of predictive variables in the final model of 154 (IQR 45\u2013412). The remaining six machine learning studies had EPV greater than 20, with median positive events 1645 (IQR 244\u20134075) and median predictive variables 11\u00b75 (IQR 6\u201339). Discussion We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic studies for COPD that used machine learning and deep learning and found a total of 18 studies. Outcomes investigated included mortality, exacerbation, and decline in lung function. There is some evidence to suggest that both machine learning and deep learning algorithms provide better predictive performance than existing regression models independent of architecture or features, particularly for the task of mortality prediction. However, this evidence does not consider the high risk of bias present in all studies or results on external validation. Poor handling of missing data, small sample sizes, and unreported CIs were the main contributors to a high risk of bias. The substantial inter-study heterogeneity observed within each clinical outcome made performance comparisons challenging due to variance in outcome timeframes, cohort demographics, predictive variables, and model architectures. However, we also noted that, within the scope of training deep learning models, it is likely that high heterogeneity is inevitable, as even random parameter initialisation can affect model convergence. 42 Therefore, pooling of highly heterogeneous results was not unreasonable provided we were mindful of the possible sources of variance. The pooled performance of machine learning and deep learning models on internal validation sets was greater than the pooled performance of regression models on external validation sets. However, of the five models that were externally validated (one prognosed exacerbation and four prognosed mortality), external performance was worse than internal performance by an average of 0\u00b709 AUC, and worse than or equal to regression models. External validation would be needed to make a definitive comparison, and the absence of external validation is an ongoing methodological issue with machine learning and deep learning studies. 4,43,44 Almost all studies had high risk of bias from handling missing data inappropriately (eg, complete case analysis without justifying missing completely at random assumptions). PROBAST guidelines recommend using multiple imputation to minimise bias while preserving the overall distribution of the data; 41 however, finding an equivalent technique for imputing missing imaging data is an area of ongoing research. 45 When considering the risk of bias due to overfitting, an EPV of more than 20 suggests a low risk of bias, whereas an EPV of less than 10 suggests a high risk of bias. 41 Within the six studies with an EPV of less than 10, studies had both small datasets with few outcome events, while also training models with many predictive variables. Multivariate feature selection to reduce the number of features should be used to reduce the risk of overfitting if cohort size cannot be increased. 41 Datasets were consistently larger in deep learning studies than in machine learning studies, with median training populations of 6016 (IQR 2407\u201310 300) people in deep learning studies and 1292\u00b75 (183\u201329 747) people in machine learning studies. In general, deep learning models have better performance and generalisability when trained on larger datasets. Despite deep learning having better performance when trained on larger datasets, we qualitatively observed an inverse relationship between deep learning mortality model performance and number of patients within the training cohort, suggesting that deep learning models were overfitted to training data. Regularisation techniques are methods for reducing overfitting in deep learning with minimal impact on performance on training data. They are varied and reasonably effective at improving generalisability, and include dropout, 46 batch normalisation, 47 and data augmentation. 48 We note that the concepts of overfitting and regularisation are poorly defined for deep learning models, as it is known that models can perfectly fit (or what would conventionally be considered as overfitting) to training data and still maintain accurate test performance and generalise well to external datasets. 49 It is currently unclear how to assess the risk of overfitting in deep learning models for predictive tasks apart from external validation and guidelines similar to PROBAST are needed for the deep learning context. Although age and sex demographics were reported in more than 75% of studies and location of recruitment was identifiable in all studies, ethnicity of study populations was poorly reported. For complete analysis and comparison of studies, full reporting of cohort demographics is required, as there are substantial racial and sex-based disparities in COPD susceptibility. 50,51 Self-identified race has been recently shown to be a strong potential confounder of image-based deep learning analyses. 52 As ethnicity is not reported in the ECLIPSE cohort, a common validation cohort for large-scale COPD studies, there is a need for additional, large-scale studies that properly report the full cohort demographics. All studies, except for three, were developed in North America and western Europe (either the USA, Canada, UK, or Spain). The other three studies were developed in South Korea 24,25 and Taiwan. 28 Therefore, caution is required when extrapolating the results to low-income and middle-income countries, where the effects of COPD are the most severe. 53 Because of the poor generalisability to external validation sets and high risk of bias, we conclude that there is limited evidence that machine learning or deep learning models have better performance than existing regression models, despite their increased complexity. However, future research using machine learning and deep learning models could lead to greater generalisability and risk of bias. In particular, the development of risk-of-bias guidelines, such as PROBAST, targeted to the development and validation of deep learning models that address topics such as missing data, generalisation, dataset size, and reporting standards would be useful to standardise study design and improve quality of evidence. From a clinical perspective, machine learning models with many input variables are not useful to practitioners who, for example, see one patient and must gather 100 variables to make a prognosis. In comparison, conventional risk scores (eg, the BODE index) and deep learning models using CT scans have more potential as clinical tools. The increasing use of CTs for differential diagnosis, for screening of lung cancer, and as a prerequisite to surgical interventions 2 provides more opportunities for CT-based deep learning models to opportunistically prognose patients with no additional effort from the practitioner, provided the model had undergone sufficient integrated testing. 54 Furthermore, the successful development of deep learning models relies on large volumes of high-quality data and intelligently designed deep learning algorithms. With regards to imaging data, publicly available, longitudinal cohort studies, such as COPDGene and ECLIPSE, have collected high-quality data that can be used as a universal baseline for testing and validating models. However, the datasets are still small relative to the size of other imaging datasets used within computer science (eg, ImageNet, with over 14 million images). Further research to develop deep learning models that properly handle CT scans is also needed. Of the studies included, only Singla and colleagues 23 developed a model using three-dimensional volumes instead of two-dimensional slices. The incorporation of multiple modalities is also a promising research direction. We observed that Moslemi and colleagues, 32 Nam and colleagues, 24 and Singla and colleagues 23 each report that combining imaging and clinical features in a final prognostic model provides better performance than either modality alone. Additionally, recent developments with large language models provide new opportunities for research. 55 These models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in being able to extract information from free text and might be able to be adapted to new domains with only a small amount of model updating through prompting; 56 however, these models remain largely untested for medical tasks. Finally, imaging deep learning models might also assist in identifying disease phenotypes corresponding to severity, demonstrated by Humphries and colleagues, 22 who developed a model to classify the Fleischner grade for emphysema severity in lung CTs that was able to better differentiate between patient mortality risk than the original Fleischner score graded by humans. Despite the potential of machine learning, disease prognosis is difficult and there is no guarantee that machine learning or deep learning models will be able to sufficiently predict patient outcomes. It is also important to mention that the clinical utility of deep learning and machine learning models cannot be demonstrated through internal and external validation studies alone. 57 Impact studies, interventional studies, and silent trials 54 are needed to evaluate whether these models can improve patient outcomes and hospital resource management. To the best of our knowledge, such studies have not occurred for COPD outcomes and are unlikely to occur until sufficient improvements have been made to demonstrate clinical equipoise. The previous study by Bellou and colleagues 4 assessed 408 prognostic regression models and found only seven (1\u00b77%) models were at low risk of bias according to PROBAST guidelines when reporting analysis, primarily due to the relatively small training dataset sizes with insufficient feature selection or external validation and poor handling of missing data. Our study exclusively examined 18 non-regression machine learning models and deep learning models and, similarly, reported a high risk of bias in the analysis of all studies for the same primary reasons, although we additionally emphasise better reporting of CIs for model outcomes. Our study is the first comprehensive review of non-regression-based machine learning and deep learning models applied to COPD outcome prognosis. The major strengths of our systematic review and meta-analysis were the comprehensive literature search of multiple databases following PRISMA guidelines, the independent screening and data extraction, and the detailed quality and risk-of-bias assessment following TRIPOD and PROBAST checklists. The major limitation of this study was the heterogeneity between studies, restricting meaningful inference of the performance of models included or regarding the best approaches to machine learning and deep learning modelling in COPD outcome prediction. The use of recalculated 95% CIs, although essential for comparison, was another limitation of our study. In general, the calculated 95% CIs matched those that were reported, except for in three studies. 21,24,25 For Yun and colleagues, 25 the reported 95% CI was significantly narrower than what was calculated or reported in other studies. Since this study had a training cohort of 344 participants, the smallest of all the included deep learning studies, we believed that it was suitable to use the calculated 95% CI. In the case of Gonz\u00e1lez and colleagues 21 and Nam and colleagues, 24 the calculated 95% CIs were narrower than those originally reported, resulting in optimistic CIs for pooled results involving these studies. Wider CIs would decrease the significance of any differences found between groupings, and, therefore, would not change the findings of this study. Our systematic review analysed 18 deep learning and machine learning studies for COPD mortality, exacerbation, and functional decline prognosis and found limited evidence of them outperforming previously reported regression models due to poor generalisability on external validation sets based on performance alone. All studies were at high risk of bias, with small events per variable ratios, poor handling of missing values, and unreported uncertainty metrics being the main factors. Future research should emphasise adherence to PROBAST guidelines where possible. Despite the limited evidence, we recommend that work on deep learning methods continues, with emphasis on models with efficient three-dimensional analysis capacity and multimodal feature analysis.

As the field continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand the landscape of highly cited publications to identify key trends, influential authors, and significant contributions made thus far. In this paper, we present a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of highly cited ML publications. We collected a dataset consisting of the top-cited papers from reputable ML conferences and journals, covering a period of several years from 1959 to 2022. We employed various bibliometric techniques to analyze the data, including citation analysis, co-authorship analysis, keyword analysis, and publication trends. Our findings reveal the most influential papers, highly cited authors, and collaborative networks within the machine learning community. We identify popular research themes and uncover emerging topics that have recently gained significant attention. Furthermore, we examine the geographical distribution of highly cited publications, highlighting the dominance of certain countries in ML research. By shedding light on the landscape of highly cited ML publications, our study provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to understand the key developments and trends in this rapidly evolving field. Keywords Machine learning ML Bibliometric analysis Web of science core collection Introduction Machine learning (ML) has undergone a transformative evolution within the field of artificial intelligence, bringing about significant changes across numerous industries and scientific domains [1,9,50]; Ezugwu et al., 2020; [49,30,34]. The rapid progress of ML techniques and algorithms has resulted in a proliferation of research publications in this field. Consequently, identifying and analyzing influential and highly cited publications have become crucial amidst the extensive literature available. These publications have made significant contributions to the advancement of ML research and its application in various domains [28,29]; Mahesh, 2022). This paper probes into the domain of bibliometric exploration in order to provide insights into the landscape of highly cited and influential publications in the field of ML research. Through the application of bibliometric analysis, our objective is to uncover crucial trends, influential authors, top journals, and significant themes within this dynamic field. This investigation serves not only to offer valuable insights into the progress of ML research but also to assist researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in identifying seminal works and gaining a deeper understanding of the field's direction. Numerous studies have previously presented bibliometric analyses focusing on specific research areas within machine learning. For instance, De Felice and Polimeni [7] conducted a study on disease forecasting, while Kim, Lee, and Park [27] explored the application of ML in mental health research. Yu, Xu, and Wang (2021) investigated research trends in support vector machines, and Su, Peng, and Li [43] examined ML research trends in engineering. These studies exemplify the diverse range of applications within ML that have been subject to bibliometric analysis. Utilizing bibliometric analysis provides a systematic and quantitative means to evaluate the impact and importance of academic publications. This approach involves examining citation patterns, co-authorship networks, and publication trends [10,11,15,40]. By employing these techniques, we gain the ability to uncover the most influential research papers, influential authors, and collaborations that have played a crucial role in shaping the field of ML research from various perspectives. Furthermore, this analysis allows us to identify the prominent research areas, methodologies, and applications that have garnered significant attention and citation within the scholarly community. More so, understanding the landscape of highly cited and high impact ML publications is vital for various stakeholders. Researchers can gain a comprehensive overview of the field, identify potential research gaps, and discover fruitful directions for their investigations [39,45]. Funding agencies and policymakers can leverage these insights to allocate resources strategically and promote impactful research. Moreover, practitioners and industry professionals can benefit from this analysis by staying abreast of the latest advancements, prominent researchers, and cutting-edge methodologies in the field. In this article, we present our findings from a meticulous bibliometric analysis of ML research, focusing on highly cited and high impact publications. Through this exploration, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the scholarly impact in the field of ML, offering a roadmap for future research directions and highlighting the most influential contributions. Our study serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders in the ML community, facilitating informed decision-making and fostering further advancements in this rapidly evolving field. The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows: In Section 2, we outline the methods utilized for data gathering and the various search strategies employed for conducting the proposed bibliometric analysis study. Section 3 provides a comprehensive presentation of the results and discussion, including a detailed description of the bibliometric study and an analysis of the data collection pertaining to different ML research publications. Additionally, this section offers an overview of the discussion surrounding the top cited ML publications. Finally, in Section 4, we draw conclusions based on the findings of this study. Data collection and search strategy In this study, we employed comprehensive data collection techniques to gather ML research publications from various sources. These sources include leading academic journals, conference proceedings, and other relevant scholarly outlets. By utilizing a diverse range of search strategies, we ensured the inclusiveness and representativeness of the collected dataset. Moreover, for this study, we retrieved data from the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection, specifically the online version of the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED). The dataset used in our analysis was updated on 18 May 2023, ensuring the inclusion of the most recent publications in the field. To construct a comprehensive dataset, we employed a carefully designed search strategy. We utilized quotation marks (\" \") and the Boolean operator \"or\" to ensure that at least one search keyword appeared in terms of TOPIC (title, abstract, author keywords, and Keywords Plus). The search encompassed the period from 1900 to 2022, spanning over a century of ML literature. Our search was primarily focused on the keyword \"machine learning.\" However, to account for variations in terminology and to capture a broader range of relevant publications, we included additional terms such as \"machine learned,\" \"machine learn,\" \"machine learners,\" \"machines learning,\" \"machining learning,\" \"machine learner,\" \"machine learnings,\" \"machines learn,\" \"machine learns,\" \"machine learnable,\" \"maching learning,\" \"learning of machine,\" and \"machine learning.\" Furthermore, we incorporated misspelled terms like \"machine learnt\" and \"machine learnig\" to account for potential typographical errors. Additionally, terms lacking spaces, such as \"machine learning based,\" \"machine learning methods,\" \"machine learnin,\" \"machine learning algorithm,\" \"machine learning classifiers,\" and \"machine learning metrics,\" were included to capture relevant documents within the SCI-EXPANDED database. By adopting this comprehensive search approach, we aimed to ensure that our analysis results are as accurate and inclusive as possible, encompassing a wide range of documents related to the field of ML research. Assessing publication impact To gauge the impact of publications in this study, we employed several citation indicators derived from the Web of Science Core Collection. These indicators provide valuable insights into the citation performance of individual publications. The following citation indicators were utilized: \u2022 Cyear: This indicator represents the number of citations a publication received from the Web of Science Core Collection in a specific year. For example, C2022 denotes the citation count in the year 2022 [17]. \u2022 TCyear: The TCyear reflects the total number of citations a publication has received from the Web of Science Core Collection since its publication year up until the end of the most recent year (2022 in our study, TC2022) [48]. \u2022 CPPyear: The CPPyear stands for the average number of citations per publication within a particular year. Specifically, CPP2022 is calculated as TC2022 divided by TP, which represents the total number of publications [18]. The use of these citation indicators, namely Cyear, TCyear, CPPyear, offers distinct advantages. These indicators ensure consistency and repeatability in our analysis, compared to directly using the number of citations from the Web of Science Core Collection [22]. To identify highly cited publications, we employed a criterion where publications with TC2022 of 100 or more were selected. This threshold allows us to focus on publications that have received substantial attention and recognition within the focused field [20]. By utilizing these citation indicators and criteria, we aim to identify and highlight the most influential and highly cited publications in the field of ML research. These indicators provide a quantitative measure of the impact and visibility of individual publications, offering valuable insights into the scholarly contributions that have significantly shaped the field of ML. Methodology and data analysis In this study, we employed a meticulous approach to identify and analyze highly cited ML documents. A total of 5402 documents with a TC (total citations from the Web of Science Core Collection) of 100 or more were searched and retrieved from SCI-EXPANDED, covering the period from 1959 to 2022. The data used in our analysis were updated as of 18 May 2023. To conduct our analysis, we downloaded the full records of these highly cited documents from SCI-EXPANDED, along with the number of citations received in each year for each document. The downloaded data were then imported into Microsoft 365 Excel for further analysis. Manual coding was performed to enhance the data and extract relevant information [2,32]. Various functions available in Microsoft 365 Excel, such as Counta, Concatenate, Filter, Match, Vlookup, Proper, Rank, Replace, Freeze Panes, Sort, Sum, and Len, were utilized to process and analyze the data [2]. These functions enabled us to perform calculations, organize the data, and derive meaningful insights. Out of the initial 5402 highly cited documents, we found 4878 documents with a TC2022 of 100 or more, accounting for 90% of the initial set. This subset of documents formed the basis for our analysis. Additionally, to refine our search strategy and ensure the inclusion of relevant documents, we applied a filter known as the \"front page\" approach [2,47]. This approach involved considering the title, abstract, and author keywords as a filter for the search keywords in the Web of Science Core Collection's Topic (TS) field. As a result, we identified 4851 documents (99% of the 4878 documents) with the search keywords present in their \"front page,\" establishing them as highly cited ML research publications. Fig. 1 shows the representation for searching the highly cited machine learning publications in SCI-EXPANDED. We obtained the journal impact factors (IF 2022) from the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) published in 2022 to assess the impact of the journals where these highly cited publications were published. This information further contributes to our analysis of the influence and prestige of the respective journals. By employing these rigorous methods and data analysis techniques, we aim to comprehensively and accurately examine highly cited ML research publications and their associated journal impact factors. These findings serve as a valuable resource for understanding the prominence and impact of ML research in the scholarly community. Authorship and affiliation handling In the SCI-EXPANDED database, the designation \"reprint author\" is used to identify the corresponding author. However, for this study, we adopted the term \"corresponding author\" to refer to the author with whom correspondence regarding the publication can be made [6]. It is important to note that in articles with unspecified authorship, single authors were considered both the first and corresponding authors [19]. Similarly, for articles with unspecified corresponding institutions, the single institution listed was considered the first and corresponding-author institution [19]. In the case of articles from a single country, the country was classified as the first and corresponding-author country [19]. This approach ensures consistency and accuracy in assigning authorship and affiliations. For articles with multiple corresponding authors, institutions, and countries, all corresponding authors, their respective institutions, and countries were considered [2]. This allows for a comprehensive analysis that considers the contributions and affiliations of all relevant authors involved in the publication. Additionally, a thorough verification process was conducted to address articles in the SCI-EXPANDED database where corresponding authors were listed with only addresses but not affiliation names. These articles were carefully examined, and the addresses were updated to include the corresponding affiliation names [2]. This step ensures that the affiliations of corresponding authors are accurately represented in our analysis. By employing these approaches to authorship and affiliation handling, we ensure that our analysis accurately represents the contributions of authors and their affiliated institutions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the research landscape in machine learning. Affiliation classification and publication performance evaluation In this study, we undertook a classification process for affiliations to ensure consistency and accuracy. Affiliations from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales were reclassified as being from the United Kingdom (UK) [5]. This consolidation allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the contributions from the UK. Moreover, affiliations initially listed as Yugoslavia were carefully checked and reclassified as being from Slovenia [46]. This adjustment ensures the correct attribution of publications to their respective countries and facilitates accurate evaluation. To evaluate the publication performance of countries and institutions, we applied six publication indicators, as outlined by Hsu and Ho [26]: \u2022 TP (Total Number of Articles): This indicator represents the total number of articles published by a specific country or institution. \u2022 IP (Number of Single-Country Articles or Single-Institution Articles): IP denotes the number of articles where the authors are from a single country (IPC) or a single institution (IPI). \u2022 CP (Number of Internationally Articles or Inter-Institutionally Collaborative Articles): CP signifies the number of articles resulting from international collaborations (CPC) or inter-institutional collaborations (CPI). \u2022 FP (Number of First-Author Articles): FP refers to the number of articles where the authors are listed as the first authors. \u2022 RP (Number of Corresponding-Author Articles): RP represents the number of articles where the authors are identified as the corresponding authors. \u2022 SP (Number of Single-Author Articles): SP denotes the number of articles authored by a single author. By utilizing these publication indicators, we gain valuable insights into the publication performance of countries and institutions, highlighting their level of collaboration, authorship patterns, and overall research output. This information aids in the assessment and comparison of their contributions to the field of machine learning. Publication impact evaluation and Y-index In addition to the six publication indicators, we also applied six citation indicators to evaluate the publication impact of countries and institutions [23]. One of the metrics used for evaluating the publication performance of authors is the Y-index. The Y-index, as defined by Ho [17,20], is denoted as the Y-index (j, h), where j is a constant related to the publication potential, determined by the sum of the first-author articles and corresponding-author articles. The parameter h is a constant associated with the publication characteristics and represents the polar angle indicating the proportion of corresponding-author articles to first-author articles. The value of j indicates the contribution of the author as a first or corresponding author to the articles. A higher value of j suggests a greater contribution by the author in terms of first-author and corresponding-author articles. The parameter h is defined as follows: \u2022 h = \u03c0/2: This indicates an author who has solely published corresponding-author articles (j represents the number of corresponding-author articles). \u2022 \u03c0/2 > h > \u03c0/4: This range signifies an author who has a higher proportion of corresponding-author articles compared to first-author articles (FP > 0). \u2022 h = \u03c0/4: This value indicates an author with an equal number of first-author and corresponding-author articles (FP > 0 and RP > 0). \u2022 \u03c0/4 > h > 0: This range represents an author with more first-author articles than corresponding-author articles (RP > 0). \u2022 h = 0: This value indicates an author who has exclusively published first-author articles (j represents the number of first-author articles). By applying the Y-index, we can evaluate the publication performance of authors, taking into account their contribution as both first authors and corresponding authors. The Y-index provides insights into the author's publication potential and the proportion of their contributions based on the types of articles they have published. This metric enables a comprehensive assessment of authors' publication impact, considering their roles and contributions to the scholarly literature in machine learning. Results and discussion In this section, we present the findings and engage in a discussion of our bibliometric analysis study, which is centered on publications in the field of machine learning and their citation patterns. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover and examine the most highly cited publications within the field of machine learning. Through an exploration of citation trends and patterns, we can gain valuable insights into the influential works that have shaped the landscape of ML research. Citation analysis provides a quantitative measure of the impact and significance of scholarly publications. Similarly, by investigating the citation counts, we can identify the publications that have gained substantial attention and recognition within the academic community. Furthermore, analyzing the citation patterns allows us to identify the key works that have contributed to the advancement of ML research and have had a lasting impact on the field. The subsequent sections of this study provide a detailed description of our bibliometric analysis approach and the findings derived from the analysis of the collected data. We present an overview of the top cited ML publications and discuss the implications of these findings for the field. Additionally, we explore the characteristics of these highly cited works, such as their authors, publication journals, and prevalent themes. By comprehensively examining the most cited publications, we aim to identify the influential authors, notable research directions, and emerging trends within the field of machine learning. These insights will contribute to the existing body of knowledge and guide researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in understanding the influential works and the evolving landscape of ML research. In the following sections, we present our findings and discuss the bibliometric analysis results comprehensively, shedding light on the key contributions and trends within the highly cited ML publications. Characteristics of document types The approach described by Monge-N\u00e1jera and Ho [35] to regenerate the characteristics of a document type involves utilizing two key metrics: the average number of citations per publication (CPPyear) and the average number of authors per publication (APP). This approach has been employed in the bibliometric analysis of highly cited articles published in SCI-EXPANDED, as documented by Ho and Shekofteh [24] and Ho and Ranasinghe [25]. To apply this approach, we followed these steps: \u2022 Define the document type: Specify the particular document type you wish to analyze based on the available data. It could be scientific articles, research papers, or another relevant category. \u2022 Gather the necessary data: Obtain a dataset that provides the total number of citations (TCyear), the total number of publications (TP), and the total number of authors (AU) for each document of the chosen type. Ensure the dataset covers the desired time frame and corresponds to articles published in SCI-EXPANDED. \u2022 Calculate the average number of citations per publication (CPPyear): Divide the total number of citations in a given year (TCyear) by the total number of publications (TP) in that same year. This calculation will yield the average number of citations per publication for the specified document type. CPPyear = TCyear/TP \u2022 Calculate the average number of authors per publication (APP): Divide the total number of authors (AU) by the total number of publications (TP) for the document type. This calculation will provide the average number of authors per publication. APP = AU/TP \u2022 Analyze the results: Examine the obtained values of CPPyear and APP to gain insights into the characteristics of the document type. A higher CPPyear suggests a greater average number of citations per publication, indicating a higher impact or visibility. Conversely, a higher APP signifies increased collaboration and multiple authorship within the document type. \u2022 Contextualize with existing literature: Consider the findings of Monge-N\u00e1jera and Ho [35], Ho and Shekofteh [24], and Ho and Ranasinghe [25] to compare and contextualize your results. This will enable validation of your regenerated characteristics and provide additional perspectives on the document type's attributes. It is important to note that the specific methodologies and any additional factors accounted for in the aforementioned study steps may influence the precise results. Therefore, a thorough review and understanding of the methodologies employed in each related study are essential for meaningful comparisons and interpretations of any regenerated characteristics. In the analysis of SCI-EXPANDED, a total of 4851 documents were found to contain search keywords in their \"font page.\" These documents represent seven different document types specified in Table 1. Among the identified documents, there were 4139 articles, accounting for 85% of the total. The average number of authors per publication (APP) for these articles was 5.8. Within the document types, reviews constituted 674 documents and had the highest CPP2022 value of 373. This high CPP2022 value could be attributed to a specific review titled \"Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition\" [31], which had a total citation count (TC2022) of 24,111. Among the 160 classic publications with a TC2022 of 1000 or more (such as [33]), 32 were categorized as reviews. Proceedings papers accounted for seven highly cited publications, followed by four editorial materials and one book chapter. The CPP2022 value for reviews was found to be 1.3 times higher than that of articles. It was also noted that highly cited medical-related documents, such as those on multiple sclerosis [25] and insulin resistance [24], had lower CPP2022 values of 1.1 and 0.85, respectively, compared to reviews. A total of 674 reviews were published across 382 journals. The journal \"Expert Systems with Applications\" had the highest reviews, totaling 15. Additionally, it was observed that some documents could be categorized under multiple document types in the Web of Science Core Collection. For example, 180 proceedings papers, eight data papers, seven book chapters, and two retracted publications were also classified as articles. Therefore, the cumulative percentages in Table 1 may exceed 100% [44]. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that contributions can differ among various types of documents. In the case of articles, they generally consist of sections like introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Based on this consideration, articles were chosen for closer analysis, specifically focusing on 4139 highly cited ML articles published in English. It is worth mentioning that among these articles, one publication appeared in a bilingual journal, presenting content in both English and Estonian languages. This bilingual approach allowed for wider dissemination of the research findings to both English-speaking and Estonian-speaking audiences. Characteristics of publication outputs The study conducted by Ho and Shekofteh [24] applied a correlation analysis between the annual number of highly cited articles (TP) and their CPPyear in the medical topic of multiple sclerosis. This analysis aimed to gain insights into the development trends and impacts of articles in this field. Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of these highly cited articles. Among the highly cited articles, a notable observation is that the highest number of articles, specifically 575, were published in 2018. Notably, it took a full five years for the number of articles to reach their peak, which was considerably longer than the highly cited multiple sclerosis articles, which took 12 years to reach their peak. The field of ML has seen increased activity from authors and researchers. In 1959, a significant article titled \"Some studies in ML using the game of checkers\" [41] had the highest CPP2022 value of 1486. This suggests the influential impact of this article in the field of ML, which has gained prominence as a relatively new research area. These findings highlight the dynamics and growth patterns within the medical topic of multiple sclerosis and the role of ML in shaping the research landscape. Similarly, in 1986, [12] introduced the article titled \"The immune-system, adaptation, and machine learning,\" which garnered a high CPP2022 score of 886. The paper investigates the relationship between the immune system, adaptation, and machine learning. It explores how principles derived from the immune system, known for its vital role in safeguarding the body against pathogens, can be applied to the realm of machine learning. The authors aimed to harness the immune system's learning, memory, and pattern recognition capabilities to construct a dynamic model based on Jerne's network hypothesis. By combining concepts from immunology and ML, the research offers the potential for developing adaptive learning algorithms inspired by biological systems. This interdisciplinary approach provides valuable insights into the synergy between the immune system and ML, with the goal of advancing the field. Web of science category and journal In 2022, the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) included a total of 9510 journals that contained citation references across 178 categories in the SCI-EXPANDED section of Web of Science. Within these categories, there were 1007 journals that published highly cited articles specifically related to machine learning. These articles were distributed among 152 Web of Science categories within the SCI-EXPANDED section. The majority of the ML articles, constituting 22% of a total of 4139 articles, were published in the field of artificial intelligence computer science, amounting to 907 articles. Furthermore, 794 articles (19%) were published in the field of electrical and electronic engineering, 459 articles (11%) in the field of information systems computer science, 429 articles (10%) in the field of interdisciplinary applications computer science, and 300 articles (7.2%) in the field of multidisciplinary sciences. It is evident that ML has gained significant attention and has been applied across a wide range of research fields. A recent study conducted by Ho [21] proposed utilizing the average number of citations per publication (CPP year ) and the average number of authors per publication (APP) as key indicators to characterize journals within a specific research topic. Table 2 in the study presents information on the top 11 most productive journals that published 40 or more highly cited articles. This includes their journal impact factors, CPP2022, and APP. The Journal of ML Research, with an impact factor of 5.177 in 2021, published the highest number of highly cited articles, amounting to 88. These articles accounted for only 2.1% of the total 4139 highly cited articles, indicating that ML is a relatively new research topic in various fields. Among the top 11 productive journals, the highly cited ML articles published in the Journal of ML Research achieved the highest CPP2022, reaching 1041. Interestingly, three of the top ten most cited articles, authored by Pedregosa et al. [37], Srivastava et al. [42], and Demsar (2006), were published in the Journal of ML Research. In contrast, the journal Expert Systems with Applications (IF2022 = 8.5) had a significantly lower number of highly cited articles, with only 190. The average number of authors per publication (APP) varied across journals, ranging from 11 in Nature Communications to 3.1 in Expert Systems with Applications. When considering the impact factor (IF2022) of the top five journals with an IF2022 more than 100, it was found that the CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians (IF2022 = 254.7) had one article, the Lancet (IF2022 = 168.9) had two articles, the New England Journal of Medicine (IF2022 = 158.5) had two articles, the JAMA-Journal of the American Medical Association had five articles (IF2022 = 158.5) had five articles, and the BMJ-British Medical Journal (IF2022 = 105.7) had one article. These five journals were among the highest ranked in their respective categories, with the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, the JAMA-Journal of the American Medical Association, the BMJ-British Medical Journal securing the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th positions among 167 journals in the Web of Science category of general and internal medicine. Furthermore, the CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians ranked first not only in the category of oncology (241 journals) but also in the SCI-EXPANDED (9510 journals). Publication performances: countries and institutions The significant contributions of two authors, namely the first author and the corresponding author, in a research article have been widely acknowledged (Riesenberg and Lundberg, 1990). Within the SCI-EXPANDED dataset, seven highly cited ML articles (1.7% of the total 4139 highly cited articles) did not have affiliations listed. On the other hand, a total of 4132 highly cited articles were published by authors affiliated with 102 different countries. Among these, 2460 articles (60% of 4132) were single-country articles published by authors from 58 countries, with a CPP2022 of 294. Additionally, 1672 internationally collaborative articles (40%) were published by authors from 102 countries, with a CPP2022 of 268. The results indicated that internationally collaborative research had a slightly lower citation impact in the highly cited ML domain. To compare the productivity of different countries, six publication indicators and six related citation indicators (CPP2022) were utilized [23]. Table 3 presents the findings for the top 15 productive countries, each having more than 100 highly cited articles. Notably, Egypt ranked 35th with 25 articles and emerged as the most productive country in Africa. Among the publication indicators, the USA led in all six categories: TP (1932 highly cited articles, 47% of the total), IP C (1045 articles, 42% of single-country articles), CP C (887 articles, 53% of internationally collaborative articles), FP (1418 articles, 34% of first-author articles), RP (1480 articles, 36% of corresponding-author articles), and SP (72 articles, 39% of single-author articles). When comparing the top 15 productive countries, France achieved the highest CPP2022 in various categories: TP (453), FP (595), and RP (570) for ML research. Canada had the highest CPP2022 of 526 for IPC, while Japan had the highest CPP2022 of 580 for CPC. With four articles in the SP category, Australia attained the highest CPP2022 of 1138. These findings shed light on the productivity and citation impact of different countries in the field of highly cited ML research. According to Ho [17], the institution of the corresponding author in a research article often represents either the study's home base or the paper's origin. In terms of institutions, 1288 highly cited ML articles (31% of the total 4132 articles) were attributed to single institutions, with a CPP2022 of 322. On the other hand, 2844 articles (69%) were the result of institutional collaborations, with a CPP2022 of 266. These findings suggest that institutional collaborations contribute to higher citation rates. Table 4 provides an overview of the top 15 productive institutions and their respective characteristics. Among them, five institutions were located in the United States, three in the United Kingdom, two in China, and one each in Canada and Singapore. Notably, Zagazig University in Egypt, the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, and Cairo University in Egypt emerged as the most productive institutions in Africa, with each institution publishing six highly cited articles and ranking 360 in the dataset. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States demonstrated its dominance in four out of six publication indicators. It achieved a TP (Total Productivity) of 127 highly cited articles, accounting for 3.1% of the total 4132 highly cited articles. Additionally, MIT had a CPI (Collaboration Productivity Index) of 102 articles, representing 3.6% of the 2844 inter-institutionally collaborative articles. In terms of FP (First-author Productivity), MIT contributed 70 articles, making up 1.7% of the 4132 first-author articles. Similarly, MIT had an RP (Corresponding-author Productivity) of 75 articles, which accounted for 1.8% of the 4124 corresponding-author articles. In contrast, Stanford University in the United States secured the top position in terms of the Institutional Productivity Index (IPI) with 27 articles. This accounted for 2.1% of the total 1288 single-institution articles. On the other hand, the University of Wisconsin, also in the United States, emerged as the leader in Single-author Productivity (SP) with 47 articles, representing 3.2% of the 186 single-author articles. In comparison to the top 15 productive institutes listed in Table 4, the University of Washington in the United States demonstrated outstanding performance. It achieved a TP (Total Productivity) of 53 articles and a CPI (Collaboration Productivity Index) of 47 articles. Remarkably, the University of Washington had the highest CPP2022 of 939 and 1038 for TP and CPI, respectively. However, the University of Toronto in Canada excelled in terms of the Institutional Productivity Index (IPI), First-author Productivity (FP), and Corresponding-author Productivity (RP). With an IPI of six articles, an FP of 20 articles, and an RP of 23 articles, the University of Toronto boasted impressive CPP2022 values of 3494, 1321, and 1173 for IPI, FP, and RP, respectively. Furthermore, the University of California, Berkeley in the United States, with three articles in the Single-author Productivity (SP) category, achieved an exceptional CPP2022 of 4804. It is noteworthy that both MIT and Stanford University are renowned institutions known for their contributions to research, including early ML research.

These factors and a strong institutional commitment to research and innovation contribute to MIT and Stanford's success in early ML research and their ongoing prominence in the field. Publication performances: authors In the domain of highly cited articles related to ML, the average number of authors per publication (APP) was 5.8. The maximum number of authors in a single article was 346 (Abolfathi et al., 2018). Out of the 4139 articles with available author information, the majority, accounting for 65% of the total, were published by groups of two to five authors. Specifically, there were 782 highly cited articles (19% of the total) written by groups of 3 authors, 685 articles (17%) by groups of 4 authors, 657 articles (16%) by groups of 2 authors, and 549 articles (13%) by groups of 5 authors. Table 5 presents the top 15 productive authors who have contributed 15 or more highly cited ML articles. Among them, Muller emerged as the most productive author, with 35 highly cited articles, including one as the first author and 15 as the corresponding author. Zhou published 21 articles, out of which 12 were as the first author. Additionally, Onan published seven articles, with five of them being single-author articles. Comparing the 15 productive authors, Zhou achieved the highest CPP2022 (citation per publication in 2021) values across all categories, with scores of 461 for all highly cited articles, 361 for first-author articles, and 491 for corresponding-author articles. Only three of the top 15 authors, Zhang, Von Lilienfeld, and Liu, had single-author articles. Notably, eight of the 15 productive authors, including Zhou, Pham, Zou, Zhang, Muller, Liu, Bui, and Von Lilienfeld, were recognized as top authors in terms of publication potential, as evaluated by the Y-index. Out of the total 4139 highly cited ML articles, a vast majority of 4125 articles (99.7% of the total) included information about both the first author and corresponding author in SCI-EXPANDED. These articles were thoroughly analyzed using the Y-index as a metric. The 4125 highly cited ML articles involved a total of 18,234 authors. Among them, 13,399 authors (73% of the total) had no first-author or corresponding-author articles, resulting in a Y-index value of (0, 0). Additionally, 1365 authors (7.5%) exclusively published corresponding-author articles with a h-index value of \u03c0/2. Furthermore, 133 authors (0.73%) had more corresponding-author articles than first-author articles, with \u03c0/2 > h > \u03c0/4, indicating a higher h-index value for corresponding-author articles compared to first-author articles (FP > 0). Meanwhile, 2001 authors (11%) contributed an equal number of first-author and corresponding-author articles, resulting in an h-index value of \u03c0/4 (FP > 0 and RP > 0). In contrast, 128 authors (0.70%) published more first-author articles than corresponding-author articles, with \u03c0/4 > h > 0, signifying a higher h-index value for first-author articles (RP > 0). Finally, 1208 authors (6.6%) exclusively published first-author articles, yielding an h-index value of 0. These analyses were conducted to explore the authorship patterns and productivity of highly cited ML articles based on the Y-index. The polar coordinate plot shown in Fig. 3 illustrates the distribution of the Y-index (j, h) for the top 41 potential authors in highly cited ML research, where j \u2265 8. Each point on the plot represents a coordinate Y-index (j, h) corresponding to a single author or multiple authors. For instance, authors Chen, Kononenko, Wang, Chicco, Yuan, Ishibuchi, Zhang, and Wang have a Y-index of (8, \u03c0/4), while Chen and Koutsouleris have a Y-index of (9, 0.6747). Among these potential authors, Zhou has the highest publication potential in highly cited ML articles, with a Y-index of (24, \u03c0/4), followed by Pham, with a Y-index of (20, 0.8851). Authors Ramprasad, Deo, Chen, and seven others share the same j-value of 8, indicating they have the same publication potential in highly cited ML research. However, they exhibit different publication characteristics. Ramprasad has published only eight corresponding-author articles with an h-value of \u03c0/2, while Deo has published more corresponding-author articles than first-author articles with an h-value of 1.030. Chen and the other seven authors have an equal number of first-author and corresponding-author articles, resulting in an h-value of \u03c0/4. Manavalan has published more first-author articles than corresponding-author articles, with an h-value of 0.5404. Similar patterns were observed for authors with j-values of 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. For example, authors Zhou (24, \u03c0/4), Onan (14, \u03c0/4), B. Blankertz (12, \u03c0/4), Hu (12, \u03c0/4), Jung (10, \u03c0/4), Verrelst (10, \u03c0/4), Schuld (10, \u03c0/4), and Zhang with seven other authors (8, \u03c0/4) are all located on the diagonal line representing h = \u03c0/4. This indicates that they share similar publication characteristics but differ in their publication potential. Zhou has the highest publication potential with a j-value of 24, followed by Onan with a j-value of 14, Blankertz and Hu with a j-value of 12, Jung, Verrelst, and Schuld with a j-value of 10, and Zhang with seven other authors with a j-value of 8. Similarly, authors Lee (9, \u03c0/2) and Ramprasad (8, \u03c0/2) are located on the y-axis representing h = \u03c0/2, indicating that they share the same publication characteristics. However, Lee has a greater publication potential compared to Ramprasad. It is important to note that the authorship analysis may be subject to potential biases due to authors with the same name or the same author using different names over time, which can impact the accuracy of the findings [6]. The top ten most frequently cited articles in machine learning research The total citations (TC) of articles are periodically updated in the Web of Science Core Collection. In order to enhance the accuracy of bibliometric studies, the total number of citations from the Web of Science Core Collection, specifically from the publication year until the end of 2022 (TC2022), was utilized to minimize bias, as suggested by Wang et al. [48]. Among the analyzed articles, 908 articles (22% of 4139 articles), 3375 articles (82% of 4117 articles with abstracts in SCI-EXPANDED), and 1511 articles (51% of 2984 articles with author keywords in SCI-EXPANDED) contained search keywords in their title, abstract, and author keywords, respectively. Table 6 presents the top ten most frequently cited articles in ML research. Among these articles, one article had search keywords in its title, nine had search keywords in its abstracts, and two had search keywords in its author keywords. One of the most frequently cited and referred-to articles concerning the paper titled \"Statistical Comparisons of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets\" is the work authored by [14]. In their publication, \"An extension on 'Statistical Comparisons of Classifiers over Multiple Data Sets' for all pairwise comparisons,\" Garcia and Herrera introduced an extension to a previously established statistical framework used for the evaluation of the performance of multiple classifiers across various datasets. This article was featured in the Journal of ML Research, specifically in volume 9, encompassing pages 2677\u20132694. Building upon the foundation laid by earlier research, the authors extended the scope of statistical comparisons to encompass pairwise evaluations among all classifiers. They also introduced novel statistical tests and procedures designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of performance variations among classifiers across a multitude of datasets. This extension significantly enhances the previous framework by delivering a more in-depth and detailed analysis of classifier performance. The article contributes to the field of ML by addressing the need for rigorous statistical comparisons when evaluating and selecting classifiers. By considering all possible pairwise comparisons, the authors provide a comprehensive approach to assess the relative performance of classifiers on diverse datasets. This extension has practical implications for researchers and practitioners in ML, as it offers a robust methodology for making informed decisions about classifier selection and performance evaluation. Inclusively, Garcia and Herrera's study presented a valuable extension to the existing framework for comparing classifiers over multiple datasets, enhancing the statistical analysis and providing a more comprehensive understanding of classifier performance. In the course of our bibliometric analysis study on ML, we discovered five influential and widely cited articles within the field. These articles, published in various years, have played a crucial role in advancing ML research and have significantly impacted the field. Although they may not be among the top ten most frequently cited, they have contributed substantially and shaped the machine learning landscape. Subsequently, the next subsections give brief details of these articles and explore their notable contributions: Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python [37]. This article has reaped considerable attention and citations since its publication in 2011. It introduced the scikit-learn library, a powerful and widely used ML toolkit in Python. The article presented a comprehensive overview of the library's capabilities, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable resource for developing ML models and conducting experiments. Its impact lies in enabling widespread adoption and facilitating the development of ML algorithms and applications. The articles were published by 16 authors from ten institutions in France, Japan, Germany, USA, and the UK, with a C2022 of 7359 (rank 1st in highly cited ML research) and a TC2022 of 29,958 (rank 1st). The article is not only the most frequently cited but also the most impactful in ML research. The article had a sharp increasing citation after its publication to reach the top of ML research. Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting [42]. The article was published by five authors from the University of Toronto in Canada with a of 3587 (rank 4th) and a TC2022 of 19,590 (rank 3rd). This article introduced the concept of dropout regularization in deep learning. Dropout is a technique that mitigates overfitting by randomly dropping units during training. The article demonstrated the effectiveness of dropout in improving generalization and preventing overfitting in deep neural networks. This contribution has become a cornerstone in machine learning, enabling the training of more robust and accurate deep-learning models. Random forests [3]. The article was published by Breiman from the University of California, Berkeley in the USA, with a C2022 of 4689 (rank 2nd) and a TC2022 of 14,127 (rank 4th). Fig. 4 shows an increasing citation trend after its publication, sharply increasing in recent years to reach the top second in ML research. Breiman's article introduced the concept of random forests, a powerful ensemble learning method. Random forests combine multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate prediction model. This article significantly influenced the ML field by presenting a scalable and efficient approach for handling complex datasets. Random forests have since become a widely adopted and successful technique in various domains, showcasing their practical relevance and impact. An introduction to ROC analysis [13]. Fawcett's article introduced the concept of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, a widely used method for evaluating the performance of binary classifiers. The article provided a comprehensive overview of ROC analysis and its applications in ML. By introducing this evaluation technique, Fawcett's work has significantly influenced the field by enabling researchers to assess the performance of classifiers in a comprehensive and standardized manner. The article published by Fawcett from the Institute for the Study of Learning and Expertise in the USA with a C2022 of 1210 (rank 8th) and a TC2022 of 11,280 (rank 5th). A survey on transfer learning [36]. Pan and Yang's article focused on the challenging problem of imbalanced learning, where the distribution of classes in the training data is heavily skewed. The article provided a comprehensive survey of techniques for addressing this issue, presenting various algorithms and strategies to tackle imbalanced learning problems. This work has been widely referenced and cited, providing researchers with a valuable resource for handling imbalanced datasets and advancing the field of ML. This article was published by authors from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China with a C2022 of 1977 (rank 5th) and a TC2022 of 9800 (rank 7th). Though not among the most frequently cited, these five articles have made significant contributions to the field of ML. Their impact lies in introducing innovative techniques, frameworks, and evaluation methods, which have paved the way for further research and advancements. Through their notable contributions, they have shaped the landscape of ML and continue to influence the work of researchers and practitioners in the field. Strengths and limitations of the study In our current investigation, we have taken several steps to mitigate potential limitations. Firstly, we have made efforts to minimize data bias by ensuring that our selection of publications is not skewed towards any particular source, publication type, or author. This safeguards the generalizability of our analysis results. Additionally, we have diligently addressed the issue of publication lag, ensuring that we consider recent publications to avoid any temporal bias. Notably, our dataset exclusively comprises publication extracts from the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection, guaranteeing the utilization of high-quality publications and citations, thus avoiding the risk of omitting relevant highly cited and impactful ML publications due to limitations in data sources or incomplete records. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that achieving a completely flawless study is a challenging task, and our work is not exempt from potential limitations. Some possible limitations include the challenge of dealing with citation self-selection, as similar studies may also be influenced by authors' tendencies to cite works that align with their own research, potentially resulting in an overestimation of certain influential papers. Furthermore, the evolving nature of the machine learning field, along with changes in terminology and subfields, may impact the identification of highly impactful papers across different decades. Interdisciplinary collaboration is a common aspect of ML research, making it challenging to carefully categorize papers within traditional boundaries, which can occasionally lead to misclassifications. The assessment of impact and significance is inherently somewhat subjective, as different scholars may have varying criteria for defining groundbreaking research. Additionally, our analysis may not fully account for temporal biases in citation patterns, such as the natural tendency for older papers to accumulate more citations over time due to their longevity. Lastly, our study's focus on \"highly cited\" and \"impactful\" publications might inadvertently exclude important yet less-cited works that have exerted a significant influence on the field. We recognize that these limitations provide opportunities for future research, and we hope that our findings will inspire and inform further exploration in this evolving and interesting area of research. Conclusion and future research directions In this bibliometric exploration, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis of highly cited and high impact ML publications. Through the employment of bibliometric analysis techniques, we sought to uncover key trends, influential authors, top journals, and significant themes within this thriving field. Our analysis shed light on the landscape of ML research, providing valuable insights into its progress and direction. By examining citation patterns, co-authorship networks, and publication trends, we identified the most influential research papers and collaborations that have shaped the field of ML research. Moreover, we gained a deeper understanding of the key research areas, methodologies, and applications that have garnered substantial attention and citation within the research community and specifically the ML research enthusiasts. The findings of our study contribute to the existing body of knowledge in ML research and its relevant applications to wide areas of interest or fields. They offer valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in identifying seminal works and understanding the evolving landscape of the field. These insights can inform future research directions, foster collaborations, and guide the development of innovative approaches and methodologies within the field of ML. While this bibliometric exploration has provided significant insights, several avenues for future research can further enhance our understanding of highly cited and high impact ML publications. Some potential directions for future research include: \u2022 Fine-grained analysis: Conduct a more granular analysis of specific subfields within ML to uncover unique trends and influential publications within each domain. \u2022 Citation analysis over time: Examining the temporal dynamics of citations to identify emerging research trends, changes in citation patterns, and the evolution of highly influential works in ML. \u2022 Collaboration analysis: Investigating the collaborative networks and patterns of co-authorship within highly cited publications to identify key research groups and their contributions to the field. \u2022 Cross-disciplinary analysis: Exploring the interdisciplinary nature of ML research by analyzing citations and collaborations across multiple domains, such as healthcare, finance, and natural language processing. \u2022 Text mining and topic modeling: Applying text mining and topic modeling techniques to extract and analyze the main themes, research topics, and emerging concepts within highly cited ML publications. By further pursuing these research directions, we can better understand the landscape of highly cited and high-impact ML publications. This knowledge will further facilitate advancements in the field and contribute to developing cutting-edge ML techniques and applications. Ethics approval Not applicable. Funding Not applicable.

In this figure, the attacker has modified the image cat-4.jpg samples on the left side by adding dog picture images to the sample data. The attacker has created the new image samples on the right side. attackers can compromise remote participants' data by inserting fake or altering existing data, which can transmit polluted training results to the server. For example, if the sample data is an animal image [4], attackers can modify it to poison the training data. This paper introduces a robust preventive approach to counter data pollution attacks in real-time. It incorporates an encrypted verification scheme into the federated learning model, preventing poisoning attacks without requiring specific attack detection programming. The primary contribution of this paper is a detection and prevention mechanism that enables the training server to supervise real-time training and prevent data modifications in each client's storage before and between training rounds. With this scheme, the training server can identify real-time modifications and eliminate infected remote participants. 1.1. Motivational Examples A simple example of a data poisoning attack is when an image file containing an animal is used as sample data [4]. The attacker can manipulate this image file to contaminate the training data. Figure 1 depicts the attacker as a participant who introduces poisoned data into federated learning by substituting cat images with dog images. Another vulnerability in federated learning arises when an attacker contaminates participants' data. In this situation, the attacker inserts polluted data into a participant's storage, impacting the FL training process. This vulnerability enables any malicious worker node to impersonate a genuine participant, train using false data, and transmit misleading training outcomes to the intended parameter server. 2. Current literature 2.1. Current literature on attack mechanisms in federated learning Numerous research papers have investigated the vulnerability of federated learning, including different attack and defense mechanisms. In one study [8], two vulnerabilities of federated learning were examined. The first vulnerability is the poisoning attack, which seeks to hinder model learning or manipulate it to favor the adversary's desired inferences. The second vulnerability is the inference attack, which compromises participant privacy. In a recent paper [2], the impact of different poisoning techniques on federated machine learning was investigated. The study's key finding revealed that the security vulnerability in federated learning enables malicious clients to disrupt the learning process by sending faulty model updates. The research [2] demonstrated that any malicious client could submit detrimental updates to impede model convergence or introduce artificial bias in the classification. Another research paper [4] focused on diverse attacking models. It concluded that the initial step of an attack involves gaining access to the local training data and modifying it as the rounds progress. Mahdee Jodayree et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 2723\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2732 2725 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 Several researchers have also explored the distinction between traditional data poisoning, which aims to alter the model's performance across significant portions of the input space [5], and other attacks that aim to hinder convergence [6]. A research paper [4] experimented on image classification attacks using three selected features as the backdoor. In this type of attack, the objective for the attacker is to generate images containing the backdoor feature to carry out the attack and train their local model successfully. The research [4] demonstrated that a single-shot attack could effectively inject a backdoor into the model. Still, the backdoor attack would take approximately 20 additional rounds to succeed fully. In this experiment, the researchers assumed the role of attackers and attempted to misclassify car images as bird images. Even with control over less than 1% of the participants, an attacker can successfully execute a backdoor attack. In federated learning, modifying a small portion of the data, where a single attacker is chosen during a round of training [4], leads to the joint model achieving 100% accuracy in the backdooring attack. This model replacement approach surpasses the performance of \"traditional\" data poisoning. Sometimes, the attacker is intelligent and sends updates based on machine learning rules rather than random parameters. Hence, a successful data poisoning attack starts with obtaining access to the original data sample from the client side. In all successful data poisoning attacks, the attacker must be able to alter the training data on a remote client and adapt the local training data from round to round. Therefore, the foundation for a successful data poisoning attack lies in gaining access to the original data sample from the client side. 2.2. Current literature on defense mechanisms in federated learning A proposed defense mechanism scheme [8] for protecting federated learning against attacks involves allowing the FL server to check for adversary attacks. However, implementing this approach would result in additional computational costs for the FL central server. Moreover, the effectiveness of different defense mechanisms varies for different attacks, each requiring a specific approach. Many defense mechanisms assume clients are not heterogeneous, but in real-world scenarios, FL clients are often heterogeneous, which the mentioned work does not address. Additionally, there needs to be more experimental evidence supporting the efficacy of the proposed framework. Furthermore, data leakage poses a vulnerability in federated learning. Federated learning is a multi-phase framework, with each phase introducing security and privacy threats [14]. For instance, evasion attacks are possible during data and behavior auditing, and employing image preprocessing and feature transformation can serve as a defense against such attacks. However, the effectiveness of these methods may diminish if the attacker is aware of the defense mechanisms. Attack detection is also crucial in federated learning. A lightweight detection scheme that examines a few parameter updates from the last convolutional layer in the FL model can identify attacks on federated learning [17]. However, this scheme is unable to detect attacks in real time. The papers above concluded that participants in federated learning could deceive and introduce data or parameter poisoning. The primary objective of these attacks is to impede the training process by either slowing down convergence or causing divergence. Previous defense schemes have yet to demonstrate the capability to detect attacks in real-time. 3. Design Challenges A Federated learning system is a distributed system that prioritizes data privacy, enabling it to address the lack of training data. However, this system design poses several architectural challenges, particularly in managing the interactions between the central server and client devices and balancing software quality attributes. These challenges can be summarized as follows: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The first step in federated learning involves constructing a global model and transmitting it from a global server to the local servers of the clients. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In the second step, the model is trained on these local servers. 2726 Mahdee Jodayree et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 2723\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2732 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In the 3rd step, the results are returned from the client's local servers to the global. This iterative process continues until a robust global model is developed. The challenge is that global models exhibit low accuracy and lack generality when client devices generate non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data. Traditional machine learning approaches have addressed data heterogeneity by centralizing and randomizing the data, but such techniques are unsuitable for federated learning due to their privacy-preserving nature. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The architectural design of federated learning necessitates multiple rounds of communication to generate high-quality global models, which entails local model updates. There is no guarantee that client devices will possess sufficient resources to handle these demands. However, conducting multiple rounds of training and communication places a significant overhead on client devices, potentially exceeding their available resources [21]. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Coordinating the learning process and ensuring model provenance, system reliability, and security becomes increasingly challenging as more client devices participate in federated learning. To prevent client-side data poisoning, a federated learning framework must safeguard the training data against modification. 4. Proposed Model To tackle these issues, our priority is safeguarding the training data on the client side, ensuring it remains unaltered during each training session. In this study, we utilize encryption-based verification to achieve this. By employing this method, the server can detect inconsistencies in the training samples provided by participants without knowing the specific data held by each individual. Our objective is to attain two crucial properties in federated machine learning. The first property involves ensuring the integrity of data storage through verification, enabling the identification of any modifications made to the original data. The second property aims to prevent adaptive data poisoning attacks by thwarting an attacker's ability to manipulate the original data from one round to the next. Currently, there are two primary approaches for reducing communication overhead. The first approach involves data compression, while the second approach focuses on reducing the number of communication rounds. Our FL- COP approach incorporates a four-level scheme for minimizing communication, with each layer representing a specific method of reducing communication. Quantization [24], sparsification [25], and reduction of communication rounds are applied at the lower levels, as illustrated in Figure 2. The optimal implementation of the key verification scheme lies at the top level, determining the number of clients training the global model. We can eliminate any malicious clients by minimizing the number of clients at this level and optimizing it effectively. The top level provides the training server with the ability to supervise and authenticate the training data of each client. In detecting a compromised client, it can be eliminated and replaced with another client possessing legitimate training data. Figure 2: The FL-COP modelling levels Mahdee Jodayree et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 2723\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2732 2727 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 The verification scheme, depicted as step 1 in Figure 3, aims to ensure the legitimacy of each remote participant and prevent third-party attackers from impersonating them by generating an iteration password. Once a participant receives the iteration password from the training server, they are considered a verified participant for that specific training session. Any attempt by an attacker to impersonate a verified participant will be unsuccessful since the attacker needs the iteration password. Additionally, the server provides the remote participant with a public encryption key, which enables them to generate a verification key for each training file and encrypt it using the public encryption key. Only the training server possesses the corresponding private encryption key to decrypt the verification file. The iteration password and decryption key are implemented in steps 2 and 3 in Figure 3. Upon receiving the public encryption key and iteration password, the remote participant selects random data from the training data files and records both the random data and its location in a verification key file. Step 4 in Figure 3 illustrates the execution of this step. Algorithm 1 Training Data file Storage Protocol for Nodes Require: An encryption key and iteration password from training server 1: Initialization Create Data file, Create blank Key file 2: Integer NumberOfByteToVerify = 75 3: Write iteration password to BOF of Key file 4: Write Checksum of Datafile to 2nd line of Key file 5: Go to next line in the Key file 6: From 3nd line of Data file to EOF of Data file 7: If NumberOfByteToVerify != 0 8: Choose random a Char from Data file 9: Write ChosenByteLocation 10: Go to next line in the Key file 11: Write ChosenByteValue 12: Decrement NumberOfByteToVerify 13: Go to next line in the Key file 14: Encrypt Key file (encryption key) Figure 3: Demonstrates the implementation of the verification key 2728 Mahdee Jodayree et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 2723\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2732 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 Algorithm 1 pertains to the protocol used by a remote node for data file storage. This algorithm facilitates the creation of a verification key file while the remote participant generates the training data file. Simultaneously, the verification key file is generated and stored within it. BOF: It serves as a distinctive marker indicating the beginning of a file. EOF: It serves as a distinctive marker indicating the end of a file. Algorithm 2 focuses on the verification of training data file integrity for each node. It necessitates the provision of a decryption key and iteration password from the training server. Algorithm 3 is responsible for verifying the verification keys during the training process. The participant's device will transmit the requested information to the server, enabling the training server to supervise the training. Algorithm 3 Node to Training server transmission key verification Require: Decryption key from the training server, All Key files and the final trained data 1: Initialization import Data file, import All Key files for the data file 2: Choose 5 random key files. 3: Decrypt the chosen key files using the decryption key 4: If the 1st line of all 5 key files matches the iteration password 5: Transmit encrypted iteration password to the server 6: If server accepts the iteration password 7: Send training result to server 8: else 9: Do not send any data Algorithm 2 Training Data File Integrity verification for each Nodes Require: A decryption key and iteration password from training server 1: Initialization import Data file, import Key file for the data file 2: Decrypt Key file (decryption key from training server) 3: If BOF of Key File Does not contain iteration password 4: Return False 5: else 6: If checksum from 2nd line of key file != checksum 7: Return False 8: else 9: From 2nd line of key file for to the EOF key file 10: Go to next line in the Key file 11: Read ChosenByteLocation 12: Go to next line in the Key file 13: Read ChosenByteValue 14: If ChosenByteValue exist in the ChosenCharLocation of Data file 15: Continue 16: Else return false Mahdee Jodayree et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 2723\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2732 2729 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 5. Novelty The newly introduced participant authentication mechanism ensures that only legitimate individuals contribute to the federated learning process. By employing the verification key scheme, participants undergo authentication before being granted access to the federated learning system. This safeguards against unauthorized or malicious participants introducing tainted data into the federated learning model. Unlike post-attack detection, the verification scheme outlined in this paper primarily focuses on preventing data poisoning. This proactive approach enables the training server to eliminate compromised clients, thereby enhancing the overall performance of federated learning training. Additionally, it prevents any modifications to the data stored by each client during training. Real-time detection of modifications is made possible, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between participants and the training server. 6. Results We implemented the first two algorithms using Google Collaborator \"Colab\" and TensorFlow. The first experiment, depicted in Figure 4, involved creating a sample key file by executing the first algorithm based on a provided sample file. Subsequently, the second algorithm successfully verified the file using the verification key in the subsequent step, as illustrated in the second part of Figure 4. After 2000 iterations, the second algorithm achieved a 98.2% success rate in verifying the original file using the key file. The final results are presented in Figure 4.

Furthermore, in a later experiment to verify the data file, the second algorithm successfully detected a discrepancy after 100 runs, identifying that the data file had been compromised. The results of this detection are showcased in Figures 6 and 7. The key file used in the experiment incorporates an iteration password, which serves as a safeguard against man-in- the-middle attacks. Additionally, it is highly improbable for an attacker to modify the data file in a manner that would result in the same original hash value. In the attack verification stage, the assumption was made that the attacker could manipulate the original data file to generate an identical hash value. The statistical formula below represents the probability of the attacker's success, assuming they can modify the original file to yield the same hash value. Let's consider a scenario where the data file consists of 100 characters, and the key file securely stores 50 characters from the original file. If the attacker decides to alter a single character, their probability of selecting a character not recorded in the key file would be 50/100. \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192 = \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192 \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153 \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018 \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018 \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192 \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153 \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0153\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2018 \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192 = 50 100 = 0.5 In this particular case, the probability of selecting seven characters that were not stored in the key file is equivalent to = 50 100 \u00c3\u2014 50 100 \u00c3\u2014 50 100 \u00c3\u2014 50 100 \u00c3\u2014 50 100 \u00c3\u2014 50 100 \u00c3\u2014 50 100 = 0.5 \u00c3\u2014 0.5 \u00c3\u2014 0.5 \u00c3\u2014 0.5 \u00c3\u2014 0.5 \u00c3\u2014 0.5 \u00c3\u2014 0.5 = (0.5)! = 0.007813 Figure 5: Algorithm 2 detects a file modification.

Conclusion In this paper, we presented a robust prevention scheme for enhancing the security of federated learning. The scheme comprises three algorithms that enable the creation of encrypted and decrypted verification keys for federated learning data files on a training node. The federated learning server can promptly eliminate infected participants and prevent backdoor attacks by introducing an encrypted verification scheme with a separate key file. The experimental results demonstrated an attacker's difficulty in modifying a data file and generating an identical hash file undetected. Moreover, subsequent experiments revealed that the success rate of an attack would be less than 1%, with the attacker relying on chance. The primary contribution of this paper lies in the detection and prevention scheme, which safeguards against data modification in each client's storage. This scheme is particularly beneficial for low-processing devices, as it requires minimal processing power. It empowers the server to detect real-time modifications promptly and eliminate infected clients. Future Work In future work, we intend to calculate this verification scheme's communicational and computational overhead and further optimize its implementation.

One common false assumption in the federated learning model is that participants are the attacker and would not use polluted data. This vulnerability enables attackers to train their models using polluted data and then send the polluted updates to the training server for aggregation, potentially poisoning the overall model. In such a setting, it is challenging for an edge server to thoroughly inspect the data used for model training and supervise any edge device. This study evaluates the vulnerabilities present in federated learning and explores various types of attacks that can occur. This paper presents a robust prevention scheme to address these vulnerabilities. The proposed prevention scheme enables federated learning servers to monitor participants actively in real time and identify infected individuals by introducing an encrypted verification scheme. The paper outlines the protocol design of this prevention scheme and presents experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness. References [1] G. Sun, Y. Cong, J. Dong, Q. Wang, L. Lyu and J.

This article aims to study open education competency data through machine learning models to determine whether models can be built on decision rules using the features from the students' perceptions and classify them by the level of competency. Data was collected from a convenience sample of 326 students from 26 countries using the eOpen instrument. Based on a quantitative research approach, we analyzed the eOpen data using two machine learning models considering these findings: 1) derivation of decision rules from students' perceptions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes or values related to open education to predict their competence level using Decision Trees and Random Forests models, 2) analysis of the prediction errors in the machine learning models to find bias, and 3) description of decision trees from the machine learning models to understand the choices that both models made to predict the competency levels. The results confirmed our hypothesis that the students' perceptions of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes or values related to open education and its sub-competencies produced satisfactory data for building machine learning models to predict the participants' competency levels.

The exchange of knowledge, ideas, and information has always been a fundamental part of education, so free sharing is familiar in this field. Open Education seeks to expand educational opportunities by taking advantage of the possibilities offered by the Internet, allowing rapid and almost unrestricted diffusion, allowing people from all over the world to access knowledge, connect and collaborate [11]. The key concept in this idea is openness, which allows not only access to materials but also the freedom to modify and use them, the creation of communities and networks to share information and work, allowing education to be personalized to the individual needs and interests or adapt to different audiences in innovative ways [53]. Open Education is founded on sharing freely and with unrestricted access. The gratuity of the materials, the freedom of use, and legal tools (such as open licenses) allow educational resources to be reused and modified by anyone [45]. By promoting free and open exchange, we can increase everyone's access to education and knowledge anywhere and at any time [25]. Therefore, open education is how people construct, produce, and share knowledge, primarily through open educational resources and digital technologies. Globally, the need for access to high-quality educational resources is a problem. In this sense, Open Education is helping to solve this problem by allowing more accessible and cheaper access to the academic community. Open Educational Resources (OER) are educational materials that are freely available and can be legally downloaded, modified and shared for the benefit of students without restriction [38]. Many educational resources have been created in digital format. What mainly differentiates OERs is that they have use licenses that grant them free and legal rights so that the public can use, modify and share them without problems. Educational resources not specified as public domain or licensed for free use cannot be considered as OER [72]. The Recommendation on Open Educational Resources from [78] is a milestone that provides guidance and strategies to all member states to advance open education worldwide and build inclusive knowledge societies. Open education facilitates the teaching-learning process flexibly and inclusively in terms of time, space, training modality, or economic restrictions [15]. Similarly, it caters to each student's needs and interests since the student determines what to study [8]. It is closely associated with lifelong learning because it is aimed at people of any age who want to continue learning or perfecting the competencies in their areas of knowledge [50]. Another potential is autonomy in controlling their learning because students learn at their own pace [49]. It not only refers to access to information but also it's modification and free cooperation, thus connecting educational communities worldwide [41]. It allows sharing successful educational practices with other professionals and promotes innovations in various educational contexts [82]. Open education proposes that people have free and open access to knowledge and education, especially relevant for those in more disadvantaged or vulnerable contexts or traditional education systems [12]. It also allows students to broaden their training beyond what they learn in their educational institutions; even those who have accessed the labor market can improve their professional development thanks to the flexible access to continuing education activities [61]. Creating knowledge and resources by researchers has significant relevance as it allows for sharing such materials with others, thereby positively influencing students' learning experience [73]. That aligns with the current global policy agenda emphasizing the need to develop procedures to promote social justice in education. Specifically, the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goal 4 [75] call for international scientific communication and initiatives to ensure access to inclusive and equitable quality education and promote learning opportunities for all; undoubtedly, open education is a strategic measure. Despite these potentialities, Open Education has certain limitations. Digital gap and digital transformation continue to challenge collaborative work for Open Education from innovation and research [68]. The digital gap refers to inequality in access to technology and Internet connectivity [3]. This digital gap can be a significant obstacle to full and effective participation in Open Education, as many open educational resources are online and require an Internet connection to be accessible. Therefore, Open Education also has certain drawbacks, including technical problems due to a poor Internet connection, unequal access due to lack of resources, high cost of the necessary equipment, need for greater autonomy and discipline on the part of the student, lack of continuous training for teachers in the design and development of Open Educational Resources, loss of social interaction between students, need for an active intervention of the tutor to avoid isolation and format resources that are not editable and that make it difficult to reuse [29,55]. Traditional education research methods have already accounted for the level of competence in Open Education of students [36,46]. Thanks to its enormous potential, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) calls for integrating artificial intelligence into educational research [76]. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is based on algorithms capable of learning automatically and, thanks to this, can predict future behavior [67]. Digital adaptive teaching uses machine learning to create personalized study plans that fit the needs and abilities of each student, identifying areas for improvement and offering adequate educational resources for their progress. In this way, specific educational itineraries can be designed that respond to the needs of each student, using machine learning algorithms that allow content to be adapted to their individual needs [34]. Despite being an emerging technology, machine learning in education has yet to reach its full potential [21]. Machine learning can be a valuable tool to complement conventional parametric models in the analysis of Open Education. Due to its flexibility, machine learning can provide additional information about differences and similarities between different subgroups, which is helpful for researchers and educators to understand the characteristics of those students with a lower level of proficiency in Open Education [81]. Specifically, this study is based on predicting students' perceived level of Open Education proficiency using two state-of-the-art explainable machine learning models: decision trees and random forests. 2 Literature review 2.1 Open education competencies Open education aims to improve how teachers and students interact with knowledge democratically. Based on the literature review [53], authors state that open education is understood as a dynamic phenomenon that leverages open educational resources in designing, implementing, and evaluating flexible educational practices that offer more opportunities for lifelong learning. Open education includes free and open learning communities, educational networks, teaching and learning materials, open data, and open-source educational tools, among others [81]. There are various frameworks for the development of open education in different educational institutions: the Open Educators Factory Framework [42], the Opening up Education: A Support Framework for Higher Education Institutions (European Commission, 2016), the framework for selecting OER based on fitness-for-purpose [24], the OpenEd Quality Framework [66] and the 6E Evaluation Framework [14]. Also, tools have been created for their assessment, including the Open and Distance Education Accreditation Standards Scale [7], the Perspectives and Opinions on OER and Other Online Educational Resources Scale [51], and the Digital Competency and Use of Open Educational Resources (CD-REA) Scale [62]. In educational sciences and technology, there is a demand to transfer frameworks and scientific knowledge to a set of actions that improve the training of professionals and solve real problems within contextual educational practices [13]. Some works, such as [79] and [2], authors consider the development of knowledge transfer indicators as under-researched. In [10], authors indicate that much of the academic sector's research needs to discover synergies that lead to knowledge transfer and educational innovation. Based on this need and aiming to follow the Recommendation on Open Educational Resources (OER) from UNESCO [77], Table 1 shows competency indicators proposed in [54] for open education. There are several studies that have evaluated the perception of students about the open education competence according to the established indicators: \u2022 Capacity building. Students participating in open education programs have been found to have higher digital skills than traditional students [60]. The findings suggest that training students in content production and management skills are essential to promote a culture of OER production [44]. \u2022 Development of supportive policies. Open education is a tool that can be used to improve the education and training of people around the world, and the development of appropriate policies is critical to its success. Student participation has been shown to ensure that open education policies are effective and relevant to students [52]. Students should be actively involved in decision-making processes. Promoting appropriate student participation can improve the quality of open education and ensure that policies are more effective and relevant to all students [37]. \u2022 Effective, inclusive and equitable access to quality OER. Open education has a positive impact on inclusive education. Students perceive how open education provides flexible, personalized, and affordable learning opportunities for those who would otherwise not have access to traditional education [23]. Open education helps address educational exclusion and improves the inclusion of marginalized groups, such as students with disabilities, who perceive how OERs exist that address accessibility barriers to ensure all students can benefit [74]. \u2022 Promoting the development of sustainability models. It is considered that to increase the sustainability of OERs, and it is necessary to improve the visibility of the resources available in the different locations and platforms currently only visible to a limited number of students [48]. In this sense, students demand learning ecosystems with connected resources [59]. \u2022 Promotion and facilitation of international cooperation. The findings suggest that students can create high-quality open educational resources and that collaboration among students can be especially effective for this purpose [43]. Open education requires students to have solid international communication and cooperation skills, especially in virtual environments. It has been shown how students who participate in open education programs are more likely to use virtual communication tools and collaborate with other students online [26]. On the other hand, the level of competency in open education has been evaluated. In [71], authors have evidenced the need to foster changes in the beliefs and perceptions of students and teachers about open education to favor the acquisition of competencies that allow developing practices. The literature has also pointed out some variables that influence open education practices, specifically sociodemographic characteristics such as gender. In [31], authors analyzed the texts of open education resources from a gender perspective and determined the need to offer a more robust vision of equality and promote the inclusive language. Taking this variable into account, authors from [28] examined the level of participation in open education programs, the reasons for their participation, the time they allocate to training and the use of the computer and internet, and they found that women preferred this typology of programs. Similarly, significant differences were found in the choice of massive and open courses: women tend to participate in practical ICT and test anxiety courses and less in entrepreneurship courses [40]. However, the study [16] focused on the perception of self-directed learning and performance in open education processes and found no significant differences in gender. The academic year is another variable considered in the studies. Open educational resources have been proven to improve student's learning and performance throughout undergraduate courses compared to those who received a teaching that did not employ them [19,18]. Therefore, this variable allows extracting relevant information that impacts teacher education processes focused on open education competency. 2.2 Machine learning Machine Learning (ML) models are powerful and flexible tools that develop computer programs that learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks like prediction [5]. These computer programs encompass computer-intensive methods that utilize data to discover patterns to make predictions based on the given examples using non-parametric methods for modeling and variable selection. Therefore, most ML computer programs do not require distributional data assumptions or explicit model specifications to analyze survey data like traditional methods [6]. ML models are more tools to analyze surveys to look for aspects such as data processing in perception studies in different research areas. In education research, machine learning models have improved processes such as grading students, increasing student retention, predicting student performance, and testing students. In [35], authors explained that machine learning allows problem-solving in reasoning, knowledge representation, prediction, learning, and perception. Also, authors such as [27] identified trends in machine learning in educational technologies where they identified areas of opportunities to use Big Data and learning analytics in education. Therefore, machine learning brings promising techniques for developing new educational models using students' and teachers' perceptions. For example, authors from [69] analyzed students' perceptions of the online learning process to determine variables that influence the students' satisfaction with online learning. In [33], authors applied machine learning to study the association between the word-count length of a test item written in Chinese, item difficulty, and students' perceptions about items in science term examinations. In [57], authors analyzed the teachers' perceptions about the school's organization activities in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) using machine learning models. In [20], authors employed machine learning to predict MOOC learner satisfaction and estimate their relative effects from specific learner-level and course-level factors. Education research has leveraged new developments in machine learning to perform complex analyses and make accurate predictions by explaining such models. Applying machine learning in acquiring educational skills offers numerous benefits, including personalized learning, enhanced knowledge retention, prediction of academic outcomes, and early detection of learning difficulties. In [83], the authors explore how machine learning can be utilized to assess student performance in STEM courses. The findings suggest that this approach can yield a more precise and objective evaluation of students' acquisition of educational competencies. Furthermore, research has demonstrated how integrating machine learning into teaching subjects like statistics can enhance comprehension of concepts and foster problem-solving skills among students [58]. Evidence from [1] supports how machine learning improves feedback and facilitates the acquisition of student competencies. Additionally, researchers have successfully employed machine learning to identify students who may require additional support to improve their academic performance [22]. Thus, the integration of machine learning in educational settings has demonstrated its potential to revolutionize the assessment of student performance, enhance the acquisition of competencies, and provide personalized learning experiences. Machine Learning offers the ability to comprehensively and accurately evaluate educational competencies, enabling effective feedback and intervention in students' learning. It has been used in assessing educational competencies encompasses various approaches, including: (1) analyzing educational data and extracting patterns to identify competencies that need improvement in university entrance exams [39]; (2) conducting initial diagnostic assessments to determine student's starting level in specific educational competencies of a training program [9]; (3) grouping students into competency levels to receive more personalized learning [70]; and (4) analyzing competency levels as indicators that assess the quality of academic programs in universities [65]. Assessment of educational competencies through machine learning models provides a more comprehensive and precise evaluation, enabling targeted feedback and intervention to enhance students' learning experiences. 3 Methodology In this work, we propose that students' perceptions of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes or values related to open education could be the basis for models predicting each participant's perceived open education competencies. This study adopts a quantitative paradigm and utilizes machine learning techniques, a branch of artificial intelligence with great potential for predicting phenomena. However, it is important to note that the purpose of our research was not to compare groups or test hypotheses, and therefore, a statistical analysis was not conducted. Specifically, we use eOpen data to predict students' perceived open education competencies using two state-of-the-art explainable machine learning models: Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forest (RF). Decision Trees (DT) is a non-parametric supervised learning method that consists of a root node, branches, and leaf nodes. Each root node represents a test on an item response, and the output from the root node is a branch. Each class label is represented in each leaf [63]. On the other hand, Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble learning method that constructs many decision trees during training time to perform classification and regression tasks [4]. We evaluate the models' performance using accuracy and confusion matrices. The use of accuracy and confusion matrices as metrics in this study provides a reliable method for assessing the effectiveness of the models [17]. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions over the total number of forecasts, providing a quantitative measure of the model's overall performance [47]. The confusion matrix offers a more detailed analysis of the model's performance by showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives [32]. That allows a nuanced evaluation of the model's strengths and weaknesses, including identifying misclassification patterns. Together, these metrics provide a robust evaluation framework that enables us to assess the accuracy and reliability of the models and make informed decisions about their suitability for the intended application. 3.1 Participants The data used in this study was collected from a convenience sample of m = 326 students from 26 different countries, with 226 females and 100 males. The students belonged to three academic degree levels: Doctoral, Master's, and Bachelor's and below. Fig. 1 displays the distribution of students across countries, while Fig. 2 provides a breakdown of the participants by gender and academic degree. The data collected from [54] was acquired with the approval of the ethics committees at the participating institutions, and informed consent was obtained from all individual participants during the data collection. The data were collected through a Google Forms self-assessment questionnaire answered voluntarily. 3.2 Instrument The eOpen instrument is intended to be of value to academic, scientific, and social communities interested in open education, educational innovation, research evaluation, and complex environments (see questionnaire in Table 5). The instrument designed in [54] measures students' perceptions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes or values related to open education and its sub-competencies using a 30-item questionnaire: 1. Capacity building (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8); 2. Development of support policies (items 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15); 3. Promotion of effective, inclusive and equitable access (items 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21); 4. Creation of sustainability models (items 22, 23, 24, 25); 5. Promotion of international cooperation (items 26, 27, 28, 29, 30); The eOpen instrument uses a four-point Likert scale (1: Strongly disagree, 2: Disagree, 3: Agree, 4: Strongly agree) to level the self-assessment questionnaire. 3.3 Data pre-processing In this experiment, we initially computed the mean value for each sub-competency score before categorizing the perceived open education competency into low-perceived and high-perceived. This categorization was based on a cut-off determined by the mean of the average students' perception of their sub-competencies. Additionally, we incorporated socio-demographic variables into our analysis, including gender (represented as 0=male and 1=female) and academic degree (represented as 0=bachelor's degree and below, 1=master's degree, and 2=doctoral degree). To reduce bias gained by machine learning models in the learning process from categories and questions with high numerical contribution, we utilized data pre-processing methods such as data normalization and balance techniques [30,64]. We followed the standardized procedure of two steps: 1) normalization, which was applied to the standard procedure over the sub-competencies scores from eOpen data, and 2) oversampling the class with lower occurrences to level its size to the class with major occurrences using duplicate instances. In Table 2 , we show the original sub-competencies scores and the pre-processed values in which the means are practically zero and the standard deviation is one in all cases, which means that all values are in the same range to avoid bias. After that, to evaluate the performance of the models, we split the data into training and testing phases. By doing so, we could assess how well the models could generalize to new data. 4 Results Table 3 displays the dataset resulting from several pre-processing steps, including setting the competency level, normalizing the data, oversampling, and dividing the data into training and testing subsets. Initially, we computed the average perception for each participant across all sub-competencies. Then we calculated the mean of these averages ( m e a n = 2.858289 ) to establish a threshold for low- and high-perceived competency levels. Fig. 3 illustrates the distribution of participants by open education competency level and gender. The data were subsequently normalized using standard normalization techniques. Since the competency levels were well-balanced, we determined that oversampling was unnecessary. The resulting dataset consisted of 236 samples in each class, as indicated in Table 3. Finally, we divided the dataset into training and testing subsets for use in the classification algorithms. The training and testing subsets correspond to approximately 90% and 10% of the total data, respectively. The respective columns in Table 3 display the class compositions of these subsets. We utilized scikit-learn v0.21.2 to construct the Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning models. The hyperparameters for each model were selected empirically, and we provide an outline of our process below: \u2022 DT: We used the default setting with the Gini impurity criterion for the Shannon information gain. \u2022 RF: The number of trees in the forest was set to 10, and the maximum depth of the tree was set to 30. The performance of the Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models was evaluated using the accuracy metric. Table 4 shows the accuracy of each model during the training and testing phases. The accuracy of each model is presented in a separate column. During the training phase, both DT and RF achieved a perfect accuracy score of 100%. That suggests that both models could learn the relationships between the input features and the output labels effectively. The behavior of the two models during the training phase was similar, which indicates that they could capture the underlying patterns in the data equally well. However, the performance of the models differed during the testing phase. RF achieved a higher accuracy rate of 93.94%, while DT's accuracy rate was lower, at 84.85%. This difference in performance may be because RF is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees, while DT is a single decision tree. RF is designed to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalizability, which may explain its superior performance on the testing data. It is worth noting that both models performed well on the testing data, with accuracy rates above 80%. That indicates that both models are suitable for predicting open education competencies based on students' perceptions of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to open education. However, the higher accuracy rate of RF suggests that it may be a better choice for this task, mainly when generalization to new data is essential. The confusion matrices in Fig. 4 provide a more detailed analysis of the models' performance beyond accuracy. In particular, they allow us to examine the models' specific types of errors. The diagonal of the matrix shows the correct predictions for the open education competency level, while the off-diagonal elements indicate the prediction errors. Each intersection between the column (prediction) and the row (actual value) represents the model's prediction compared to the original open education competency level. In Fig. 4, low and high open education competencies are represented with the numbers 0 and 1, respectively. The performance of DT is presented in Fig. 4a, where the number of students incorrectly classified by the model in predicting their open education competency level is illustrated. Three students were classified as high competency level when they actually had a low competency level, and two students were predicted to have a low competency level when they actually had a high competency level. Fig. 4b displays the performance of RF and only shows two prediction errors. Specifically, two students were predicted to have a low competency level when they actually had a high competency level. To compare the performances of the two models, one can observe that the RF model had a higher true positive rate than the DT model, indicating that it was more effective in predicting the high competency level. However, the RF model still made two misclassifications where it predicted a low competency level for students who actually had a high competency level. Interestingly, the DT model also made the same two misclassification errors, which suggests that these instances were particularly challenging for both models. The DT model's top features we acquired during our experiment are illustrated in Fig. 5 , while the complete tree can be found in the Appendix section (Fig. A.1). The tree diagram represents the model's decision-making process based on the collected data features. The trees generated by DT and RF models have an advantage over other models since they are easily interpretable. The top features that contribute the most to the prediction of open education competency level are displayed at the top of the tree. The most critical features in the model's decision rule were the academic degree and the sub-competency of promoting effective, inclusive, and equitable access. Additionally, the sub-competencies of capacity building, development of support policies, and creation of sustainability models also played a significant role in the model's prediction. The decision rules learned by RF using the eOpen data are presented in Fig. 6 , and the complete model can be found in the Appendix section (Fig. A.2). In contrast to DT, the decision rules formulated by RF gave more importance to three sub-competencies: the development of support policies, capacity building, and promotion of effective, inclusive, and equitable access. These sub-competencies were the most crucial features used for building a tree from RF. Moreover, at the subsequent level of the tree, gender was also considered, along with the sub-competencies of development and access. The visual representation of the decision rules obtained from RF offers a better understanding of the factors contributing to the prediction of open education competency level, making it a valuable tool for policymakers and educators. One of the main advantages of using DT and RF in machine learning is that these models produce decision rules that are easily interpretable and explainable. That means we can easily understand how the model arrived at its predictions, which is particularly useful when understanding the factors contributing to a particular outcome or identifying areas for improvement. Furthermore, both DT and RF demonstrated exemplary performance in predicting the open education competency level of the testing instances, achieving at least 84.85% accuracy. Although RF performed better than DT, both models effectively predicted the competency level. Despite these differences, DT and RF offer complementary strengths, and choosing the appropriate model for a particular task will depend on the specific characteristics of the problem and the available data. Overall, the results obtained in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of both DT and RF in predicting open education competency levels and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate machine learning models for specific tasks. 5 Discussion Machine learning has become a popular approach to analyzing large datasets and has shown promising results in many fields. In education, machine learning models can be used to analyze data related to students' perceptions and identify patterns that may not be apparent using traditional statistical analysis techniques. The ability of DT and RF models to predict open education levels from self-assessment surveys, as shown in Table 4, is an example of how machine learning models can be used to provide valuable insights into students' perceptions. This finding is consistent with the results obtained in [56], who also employed machine learning techniques to analyze perception data. In [39], authors employed machine learning techniques to gather insights into students' performance in educational competencies for identifying potential areas for improvement within the teaching and learning process. In [70], a personalized learning approach was designed based on the distribution of students into competency levels. Similarly, in [9], in which an initial assessment was performed to identify training needs and develop a more contextualized educational competency program. By providing a better understanding of students' perceptions, machine learning models can help educators develop targeted interventions that can improve student learning outcomes. Machine learning models' forecasting errors can be revealed through confusion matrices, offering valuable insights. As shown in Fig. 4, both DT and RF models misclassified as high-competency levels of the same two students. Nonetheless, it's typical for high-dimensional datasets such as eOpen to present difficulties when constructing precise decision boundaries for accurately classifying all instances. Similar challenges have been reported in other studies, such as [30] and [64], where confusion matrices were used to analyze bias in prediction models related to student's academic achievement and dropout rates. Given the importance of confusion matrices in identifying model bias and detecting challenging instances, they can play a crucial role in model selection. Analyzing confusion matrices can help develop strategies to reduce bias and challenging instances to establish the limits of such models. By leveraging the insights provided by confusion matrices, we can enhance the performance of machine learning models and better understand their limitations. Overall, these matrices are a valuable tool in interpreting and evaluating machine learning models. Decision trees (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models generate decision rules by selecting the most important data features to predict the open education competency level. Similarly, DT and RF models have been employed in other studies, such as in [65], which focused on analyzing students' competency levels as indicators for assessing the quality of academic programs in universities. The top features used in both models can be seen in Figs. 5 and 6. According to [80], machine learning models can identify self-reported predictors from perception data, indicating the potential of using these models to enhance our understanding of human behavior and perception. Thus, DT and RF are advanced machine learning models that can identify the data features critical for predicting open education competency levels. Understanding these critical features can provide significant insights into students' perceptions, which can help create better educational policies and strategies. Furthermore, both models can predict the competency level with high accuracy, making them reliable tools for analyzing large datasets in the field of education. 6 Conclusions In recent years, the field of education has seen an increase in interest in open education to democratize access to education and provide more equitable opportunities for learners. However, despite its potential benefits, there are still challenges in measuring and assessing open education competencies. This study aimed to address this issue by exploring the use of machine learning models to predict open education competency levels based on student perceptions. The study results suggest that machine learning models can effectively predict competency levels using features extracted from student perceptions. This finding is significant because it demonstrates the potential of machine learning to provide valuable insights into learners' competencies and inform educational practices. The goal is to create a more inclusive and accessible education system to support learners of all backgrounds and abilities better. This research used two machine learning models to analyze the eOpen dataset. Our approach involved several steps: 1) extracting decision rules from students' perceptions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes or values that are associated with open education to predict their competency level using Decision Trees and Random Forests models, 2) examining the forecasting errors of the machine learning models to detect any potential bias and challenging instances, and 3) interpreting the decision rules generated by the models to gain insight into the features that were used to predict the competency level. With the help of these techniques, we were able to easily classify students' competency levels based on the eOpen data. These methods offer a more flexible and effective means of analyzing students' perceptions data, which has traditionally been challenging to analyze using traditional methods due to their reliance on explicit model specifications and distributional assumptions prior to prediction. While this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in analyzing perception data and predicting competency levels, the study's limitations must be acknowledged. One limitation is that decision trees only reveal the features chosen by the model to build decision rules, and it requires the researchers to interpret and explain the model's decisions. Moreover, while this study utilized a sample size of 326 student answers, it is essential to note that further research is necessary to ascertain the generalizability of the findings to larger populations. Finally, while machine learning models offer new opportunities for data analysis, they require significant expertise and resources to be implemented effectively, which may limit their applicability in some settings. This study implies for practice and research that machine learning models can be used to predict open education competency levels based on students' perceptions of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes or values related to open education. That can assist educators in identifying areas where students may need additional support or resources. The results also highlight the importance of using perception data to gain insight into students' competencies, as this data can be more quickly and accurately analyzed using machine learning techniques. Also, this study contributes to the growing body of literature on machine learning and its applications in education. The findings suggest that machine learning models can effectively analyze perception data to predict competency levels, which could lead to further research on using machine learning in education. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of understanding the decision-making process of machine learning models and the potential biases that may be present. Further research could explore how to mitigate biases and challenging instances and improve the accuracy of the predictions. Overall, this study provides a foundation for future research on using machine learning in education and highlights its potential for improving our understanding of students' competencies.

The recent advance of digital twin (DT) has greatly facilitated the development of predictive maintenance (PdM). DT for PdM enables accurate equipment status recognition and proactive fault prediction, enhancing reliability. This shift from reactive to proactive services optimizes maintenance schedules, minimizes downtime, and improves enterprise profitability and competitiveness. However, the research and application of DT for PdM are still in their infancy, probably because the role and function of machine learning (ML) in DT for PdM have not yet been fully investigated by the industry and academia. This paper focuses on a systematic review of the role of ML in DT for PdM and identifies, evaluates and analyses a clear and systematic approach to the published literature relevant to DT and PdM. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art applications of ML in various application areas of DT for PdM are introduced. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of ML for DT-PdM are revealed and discussed. The outcome of this paper can bring tangible benefits to the research and implementation of ML in DT-PdM. Keywords Digital twin Predictive maintenance Machine learning Prognostic and health management 1 Introduction The digital twin (DT) consists primarily of a physical entity, a digital copy, and a connection, to leverage virtual analytics to enhance the performance of the physical entity [1,2]. The concept of the DT emerged from NASA's Apollo program, integrating information and data from cyberspace and physical space [3]. The concept of DT was initially proposed by Michael Grieves and has since then become a widely used term [4]. Companies have applied various models to their systems engineering output, incorporating physical and mathematical models. In 2012, NASA conceptualized DT as \"the integration of a multidisciplinary, multi-scale simulation process that makes full use of physical models, sensors, operational history, and other data, which serves as a mirror image of the physical product in virtual space and reflects the full life-cycle process of the corresponding physical entity product\" [5]. However, the implementation of intelligent manufacturing based on DT is still in its infancy, as far as the concept, characteristics and general framework of DT are concerned [6]. DT is now widely researched in product lifecycle management. In particular, publications on DT for predictive maintenance (PdM) have gained a lot of attention in recent years. The DT application adopts a proactive approach to equipment management services by integrating real-time equipment sensor data such as temperature and vibration with environmental data, to update the DT model and prevent unplanned downtime. Therefore, the research on the current state of DT-PdM is crucial, which allows for precise equipment status validation, early fault detection, and ultimately contributes to enhanced stability and reduced costs for organizations. PdM techniques are utilized to assess the condition of equipment in operation, thereby predicting when maintenance will be required. This approach not only saves costs compared to routine or regular preventive maintenance but also enhances operational efficiency [7,8]. As per a report by IoT analytics in Hamburg, Germany, the PdM market is presently valued at $6.9 billion and is projected to reach $28.2 billion by 2026. There are currently over 280 PdM solution providers in the market, which is expected to grow to over 500 by 2026. The ultimate goal of PdM is to enable condition-based maintenance by utilizing real-time or near-real-time data transmission and relevant modeling techniques to improve a company's operational reliability and facilitate continuous improvement [9\u201311]. As per a report by IoT analytics in Hamburg, Germany, the PdM market is presently valued at $6.9 billion and is projected to reach $28.2 billion by 2026. There are currently over 280 PdM solution providers in the market, which is expected to grow to over 500 by 2026. DT-PdM is an essential technology for fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, and health indicator (HI) construction. It has been applied in diverse domains such as computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, bearing, and gearbox, utilizing multi-source datasets to construct virtual models for optimization of PdM applications. Data-driven models currently require the collection of large amounts of multi-source data and the construction of models from a variety of sources including internet of things (IoT) data, environmental data, operational data, simulation data, and control data [12\u201319]. Physics-based models are also an important modeling approach, such as finite element analysis (FEA) to construct DT models from components [20]. DT, as a new technology that takes advantage of both a physics-based approach and a data-driven approach, has gained increasing attention in PdM [9,21\u201323]. Fig. 1 illustrates a line graph showing the number of papers published on ML-PdM and DT-PdM indexed by Google Scholar from 2001 to 2022. It can be seen that both ML-PdM and DT-PdM have undergone rapid growth in recent years. ML-PdM has consistently had more publications than DT-PdM each year, while DT-PdM witnessed moderate growth. The current implementations of DT-PdM face challenges in building high-fidelity models and deploying them in the industry. One of the main reasons is that it is hard to integrate, analyze and model the multi-modal data and derive the information and knowledge for DT. Machine learning (ML), as the key technology in advanced data analytics, plays a critical role in DT-PdM. Therefore, it is worthwhile to collect review and analyze the recently published papers to identify the role and function of ML in DT-PdM. ML is an essential technology to facilitate the development of DT-PdM [24]. It has been used in many fields such as manufacturing and aerospace [25,26]. With the development of sensor technology, data is collected, stored, and applied in a data-driven PdM. In addition, data combined with physical information is also becoming an effective modeling approach. ML uses valid data to reveal hidden knowledge and build complex correlations to improve model accuracy and help make decisions on problems [27]. In the context of industry 4.0, the topic of DT-PdM has received continued attention but still in its infancy. Therefore, many researchers have studied ML techniques to facilitate the development of DT-PdM, such as fault diagnosis and RUL prediction in virtual spaces [28,29]. However, existing review articles relevant to DT-PdM mainly focus on analyzing the application scenarios of DT-PdM, categorizing DT models, or researching specific components. There is still a lack of exploration of the role and function of ML [5,30,31]. Therefore, the main contributions of this paper are: (1) a framework for DT-PdM with ML techniques is proposed; (2) the role and function of ML in DT-PdM are identified through the critical review of relevant papers published in the last five years; (3) the research challenges and future opportunities to address implementation issues and proposing solutions in high-fidelity digital model construction, data fusion, physics informed-machine learning and cloud-edge collaboration when implementing DT-PdM are discussed. The rest of the paper is organized as followed: Section 2 introduces the state-of-the-art DT and PdM, including an introduction to DT and PdM respectively. Section 3 details the methodology of collecting review papers, and Section 4 introduces the role and function of ML in DT-PdM, as well as explaining the contribution of DT techniques in establishing applications. The opportunities are discovered and clarified in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes. 2 The state-of-the-art of digital twin and predictive maintenance 2.1 Digital twin in manufacturing According to recent reports, the spending on DT has already reached $4.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to around $34 billion in 2030. This includes various technologies such as computer-aided design (CAD) modeling, connectivity, cloud computing, industrial internet of things (IIoT) software platforms, remote monitoring, shop-floor worker hardware, physics-based simulation, ML, and systems integration, among others, all of which contribute significantly to the development of DT [32\u201338]. Essentially, the DT consists of three main components: the physical product in physical space, the virtual product in virtual space, and the interface for data and information interaction between physical and virtual space [5]. In essence, the DT is a reverse engineering feat in which everything that happens in the physical world is replicated in the digital space. A true full life cycle concept is realized through continuous tracking and feedback. The DT has several key features, including: (1) DT allows the collaboration and communication between physical entities and digital avatars [39]; (2) DT can generate insights and predictions about the behavior and performance of the physical asset; (3) The presence of DT allowing manufacturers to test and optimize their operations virtually before implementing changes in the real world; (4) DT can be continuously improved by collecting data, analyzing performance, and providing feedback for optimization. DT are virtual models of physical entities that can be used to simulate their behavior and predict their performance. The development of technologies such as IoT, big data, and edge computing have paved the way for the development of DT modeling in the manufacturing industry. It can help optimize production processes, reduce downtime, and improve product quality by identifying and addressing issues before they occur. The origins and development of DT are deeply rooted in the industrial sector, initially to ensure reliable and stable equipment for the US Air Force, and later to improve efficiency in product design, development, and testing across various stages of the product lifecycle. Intelligent scheduling is an essential aspect of technology in the workshop. However, traditional algorithmic models, such as Markov models, may not always guarantee long-term stability and accuracy in workshop scheduling due to the presence of large coupling factors. Therefore, the use of DT technology, which combines real and virtual interactions to automatically optimize algorithms, can enhance production planning and scheduling, and reduce the impact of production downtime on site. In recent times, the commercial landscape of DT in manufacturing has greatly improved, with companies pushing the boundaries of its application. An excellent embodiment of this shift is the foray into the \"industrial metaverse\". The cutting-edge technology companies such as Siemens has launched its take on the industrial metaverse. Their approach to the DT goes beyond mere mimicry of physical assets in a digital environment. Siemens' platform brings together the twin's representation with data analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation in a dynamic ecosystem. The ecosystem promotes collaborative design and operations, with real-time updates and integrations, which can promote the evolution of tools tailored for diverse manufacturing needs [40]. In recent years, Nvidia also has focused on the industrial metaverse. Nvidia's Omniverse platform\u2014a collaborative and physically accurate simulation environment This platform allows manufacturers to visualize intricate processes and scenarios in high fidelity, ensuring that even the minutest of details can be reviewed and refined. Furthermore, Nvidia\u2019s prowess in AI plays a crucial role in analyzing data within this metaverse, driving predictive insights and performance optimizations [41]. The collaboration between Nvidia and Siemens in establishing an industrial metaverse represents a pivotal moment in the DT journey. It\u2019s not just about replicating the physical in the digital realm anymore. It's about building a comprehensive, interconnected, and intelligent virtual environment that can grow, adapt, and innovate alongside its physical counterpart. In addition, DT technology has found its application in diverse industries such as machinery, logistics, the energy industry, weaponry, and others [5]. For instance, Rauscher et al. developed a DT-based simulation tool to minimize the duration of reactor downtime at the plant, which improves the quality and consistency of the input data and enables credible information to be derived from the simulation results to support the design and decision-making process [42]. Wu et al. [43] proposed an architecture of service platform for cold chain logistics using Internet of Everything and DT. Hu [44] proposed a mutual information-enhanced DT approach to promote the performance of vision-guided robotic grasping. CNC machine tools currently tend to affect production due to accuracy. Researchers have investigated DT for the condition monitoring of machine tools [45,46]. Building upon the versatility of DT, another significant application is PdM. PdM, backed by numerous academic studies, has become a sought-after approach in prognostic and health management [47\u201349], with many organizations embracing it for notable cost savings and efficiency enhancements. 2.2 Cutting-edge applications of predictive maintenance PdM techniques are utilized to assess the condition of equipment in operation, thereby predicting when maintenance will be required. This approach not only saves costs compared to routine or regular preventive maintenance but also enhances operational efficiency [7,8]. The ultimate goal of PdM is to enable condition-based maintenance by utilizing real-time or near-real-time data transmission and relevant modeling techniques to improve a company's operational reliability and facilitate continuous improvement [9\u201311]. Currently, there are three primary PdM solutions: data-driven modeling, physical-based modeling, and hybrid modeling which combine both data-driven and physical-based methods. Data-driven modeling involves using multidimensional, large amounts of data gathered by sensors for research, exploration, and mining, along with domain knowledge to build models for PdM of equipment. Physical-based modeling is the study of the laws of motion of matter, combined with a variety of factors, and possibly the use of hypotheses and other methods to explore the laws and knowledge of PdM of equipment through simulation. In addition, the hybridization of data-driven and physical-based methods is an important approach to PdM, where data-driven models and physical models are combined to form hybrid models and make predictions. Further details are provided in the next section. Deep learning is the latest advanced technique in ML. Besides Deep learning, the classical ML algorithms also have been instrumental in the advancements of DT-PdM [3]. However, their applications and efficacies vary based on specific tasks and the data type [50]. The classical ML algorithms are efficient for datasets of moderate size. Classical ML algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, or clustering techniques can be effective when the data structure is less intricate [51]. When deploying classical ML algorithms, feature engineering is needed. In contrast, deep learning algorithms require substantial amounts of data and large computational resources to train effectively. Deep learning can be effective in extracting features from complex internal structures like images, text, or high-dimensional sensor data without complex feature engineering [52]. The development of ML techniques has facilitated the data-driven method for PdM [53]. This approach has shown promising results in fault diagnosis and RUL prediction. For instance, Yu et al. employed a non-linear approach to degrade the intrinsic signal components and identified the dynamic matrix of different gear faults through the transfer function of gearbox vibrations under non-stationary conditions [54]. Chen et al. introduced the gcforest algorithm to PdM and built predictive models, which were implemented successfully [55]. Jamil et al. proposed a transfer learning model that extracts useful information from small training samples for similar working conditions and models, achieving high model accuracy in diverse environments [56]. Zuo et al. developed a probabilistic spike response model to facilitate multilayer network learning and improve the performance of the model for bearing fault diagnosis [57]. Among numerous studies of data-driven PdM, deep learning has gained increasing attention in recent years since it can automatically extract the key features relevant to the health status of assets. Although data-driven PdM is the focus of current research and relatively easy to collect input information, physical modeling cannot be ignored to aid the development of PdM. The physics-based approach primarily employs physical principles to explore, summarize, and emulate the operation of a system [58]. Physical model-based PdM is also a crucial method, such as finite element methods, which use mathematical relationships to explore potential relationships [9,59]. Finite element models and Monte Carlo methods are utilized to reduce the uncertainty in life prediction and build life prediction models for predicting component life [9]. Numerical analysis is another alternative approach where the stress data collected from feedback sensors are modeled by analyzing the uncertainty of the crack from a microscopic perspective to study degradation trends and analyze the RUL of the component in conjunction with the crack length [9,60]. The hydraulic pump generates power in the machine, and da Silveira et al. used knowledge exploration and mapping to derive a physical model of the sub-process and a model based on vibration analysis to implement PdM on the hydraulic pump [61]. Aivaliotis et al. developed a method for calculating RUL based on physical simulation models for PdM of production equipment using predictive and health management (PHM) techniques. The resources of a production plant are modeled to enable the simulation of its functions and to identify maintenance activities for the machines [21]. Physical model development is based on interdisciplinary analysis of multiple physical fields in coupled systems. However, the current PdM-based approach primarily focuses on a single physical modeling approach, leading to inadequate exploration of the integration of multiple modes in the physical field. These modes include the kinematic field, chemical reactions, electrostatic interactions, and physical fields [22]. Hybridizing data-driven and physical methods have great potential in promoting the development of PdM-based physical modeling that considers these important factors. The use of data-driven and physical hybridizations is becoming increasingly popular in enhancing data-driven models with physical models. This approach involves synthesizing data generated by a physical model with the original data to create a life prediction model with improved accuracy. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, especially in high-assurance models [9,62]. Optimization of physical models by ML requires appropriate and necessary conditions [63]. However, the optimization of physical models by ML requires certain necessary and sufficient conditions. The necessary conditions involve a causal relationship between the input and output parameters, while the sufficient conditions involve the theoretical construction of input parameters and output results [22,64]. Recent research has proposed various hybridization methods for improving the accuracy of reliability analysis. For instance, Zheng et al. developed a regularized deep polynomial chaos neural network to achieve iterative learning of expansion coefficients and used this method to improve the reliability of satellite systems [65]. Yu developed a hybrid DT-based physical and data-driven model to identify minor faults in gearboxes [66]. Similarly, Chi et al. proposed a systematic framework approach for dynamically analyzing the real-time reliability of information systems by constructing an extreme learning machine and simulating energy management system behavior based on a stacked autoencoder (AE) model [67]. Li et al. proposed a novel high-dimensional data abstraction framework for reliability dimensionality reduction using Gaussian functions to capture the limit state functions in the latent space for process regression [68]. To summarize, the integration of data-driven and physical-based approaches can be beneficial to the development of DT-PdM. Data-driven approach can be restricted by the limitations in data collection, and the quality of data may not meet the requirements of the specific application. On the other hand, a physical-based approach can address the lack of data samples, but integrating physical knowledge for the development of data-driven methods can be challenging. Thus, hybridizing data-driven and physical methods requires more attention in the future research. 3 Research methodology In this section, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the use of DT-PdM. The methodology involved five steps: specifying research questions, identifying search sources, formulating criteria for article selection, classifying articles published within the last five years based on an extensive review, and providing a brief description of each article. The approach ensured a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the existing literature. The review aimed to provide an overview of the current state of research and application of DT-PdM and to identify gaps and areas for future research. 3.1 Research questions To address the aforementioned development challenges of DT for PdM, this section aims to investigate the role of ML technology in this context.

As shown in Table 2. 3.2.5 Classification of recent research work In the previous section, recent research on DT for PdM was reviewed including the implementation process of different PdM applications using DT techniques. It is found that ML techniques play a crucial role in DT for PdM, but there is still a part where ML techniques are not applied. Table 2 classifies the articles of DT for PdM in the last five years. In Table 2, the main classification objectives include exploring the role of ML techniques in DT for PdM and whether ML techniques have been used to build the model. Another classification is the type of ML techniques used, including traditional ML algorithms, deep learning, and transfer learning. More than half of the studies have applied ML techniques to build DT for PdM models. In addition, data is an important aspect of ML but is often overlooked. Lastly, research objectives and tasks are included separately, as the results of the research are equally important. Several insights from Table 2 are listed as follows: (1) Data types: The studies consider various types of data for analysis, such as sensor data, inspection data, force measurement data, acoustic data, vibration signals, images, text, simulation data, etc. ML plays a crucial role in identifying patterns, anomalies, and trends related to asset health and maintenance needs. However, how to comprehensively integrate these multi-source data for DT-PdM needs to be further explored. (2) The use of ML: Various machine learning algorithms have been utilized, including deep learning, SVM and Random Forest. Among different types of algorithms, deep learning is the majority choice in these studies due to its capability to extract the senior features relevant to the asset health status from the multi-source data. (3) Research tasks: The research tasks of these studies primarily focus on fault diagnosis, HI construction and RUL prediction. These are the main tasks in PdM, which aim to enhance maintenance decision-making by predicting and identifying potential faults or degradation in the assets. Deep learning has emerged as the most prevalent ML technique in PdM applications. This is achieved through the collection of high-quality input data that includes different data types such as signals, text, and images [10]. Deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) has been shown to be effective and has been applied to many industrial applications such as fault diagnosis, HI construction, and RUL prediction for different targets such as bearings, gearboxes, and pumps [9,66,76]. However, while deep learning has been widely applied to PdM, its impact on DT has not been extensively explored. The use of deep learning requires large amounts of training data. Moreover, deep learning algorithms require large computational resources for model training, which can be a challenge in the actual deployment. \u2018Black-box\u2019 models like deep learning also pose challenges for explaining ability, leading researchers to develop interpretable models for DT in PdM. Nonetheless, while most DT-PdM applications involve a large number of input data sources and use ML techniques, some of these data sources are poorly described, and multi-source data collection is often inadequate. It is challenging to construct a DT based on inadequate multi-source data to promote the performance of PdM. Therefore, exploring the role of ML in DT-PdM is crucial. 4 Machine learning for digital twin-driven predictive maintenance The integration of information technology into manufacturing has facilitated significant advancements through digitization technology. It has led to the development of various practical applications, which have been focused on enhancing the role of information technology in manufacturing and achieving seamless data transfer and virtual-real relationships between the physical and virtual domains [21,79,83,84]. As a result, the industrial system's overall development strategy has prioritized the implementation of DT technology. DT has received increasing attention from the industry due to its ability to encompass all stages of structural design, manufacturing, assembly, and operational health management. This emerging set of concepts has been applied to manufacturing, including machinery and production lines, to enhance plant operations management. The technology enables real-time monitoring of operating equipment, leading to improved efficiency in the inspection and repair of faulty equipment, which can reduce productivity loss caused by equipment failure and regular maintenance requirements [74]. In the context of DT-PdM, ML plays a pivotal role in leveraging the power of DT. By analyzing the vast amounts of multi-source data such as monitoring data and maintenance data, ML algorithms can detect patterns and anomalies indicative of equipment failure or performance degradation. The essential tasks in PdM such as HI construction, RUL prediction, and fault diagnosis can be implemented via the modeling of multi-source data using ML. Before diving into how DT aids Predictive Maintenance (PdM), it's crucial to understand the key tasks integral to PdM: 1. Health indicator estimation: An aggregated metric or a set of metrics that give a snapshot of the current health or condition of a piece of equipment. This index allows operators to track the overall well-being of machinery and decide on appropriate actions based on its status. 2. Remaining useful life prediction: An estimate of the time left before a machine or equipment reaches the end of its effective operational life. This prediction helps plan maintenance activities and replacements in a timely manner. 3. Fault diagnosis: The process of identifying, isolating, and pinpointing the root cause of a malfunction or an anomaly in a system. It provides clarity on specific problems, facilitating targeted repair and maintenance actions. With the aforementioned concepts clarified, the role of ML for DT-PdM can be better identified. PdM, at its core, revolves around the systematic use of HI, RUL, and fault diagnosis to predict the future condition of equipment and schedule maintenance accordingly. ML is the key component in this framework. By harnessing ML to sift through voluminous datasets from different data sources, it becomes possible to identify the degradation and faulty patterns of equipment issues.The relationship between the multi-source data and different tasks is illustrated in Fig. 3. The advantage of DT-PdM is that it can guide the twin model's evolution in real-time according to changes in the physical object's operating state through the interaction of data between the physical object and the virtual model [28]. The simulation analysis feeds the prognostic results to the diagnostic control center of the DT, which helps the physical entity optimize and make decisions. ML in DT offers tremendous potential for revolutionizing of PdM. By leveraging the insights and capabilities of these technologies, organizations can optimize their maintenance practices, achieve greater asset reliability, and drive significant improvements in operational performance. With the ability to accurately diagnosis the faulty state and predict the equipment failures, ML empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions and take proactive measures to ensure the smooth operation of manufacturing processes and maximize productivity. In this section, a DT-PdM framework is first elaborated. Subsequently, the role and function of ML in DT-PdM are reviewed and discussed. 4.1 Digital twin-driven predictive maintenance framework Implementing PdM applications has been a challenge for many scholars, as noted in previous research [77,78,85], However, the continued development of DT has provided a broad and acceptable technical framework for DT-PdM, which contains physical entities, digital entities, and connectivity-related components [12,73,86]. Despite this progress, integrating PdM into a common DT framework remains a formidable challenge that requires extensive research and development efforts to overcome. To address this challenge, the American National Institute of Standards and related research are designing ISO 23247 to help standardize DT frameworks [69,87]. The standard provides a targeted integration of the DT framework and the PdM framework, clearly stating the general principles of the framework, the reference system, and relevant information, and proposing relevant reference models [2]. Based on the existing work [88], a DT generic framework for PdM is proposed in Fig. 4, which combines ML techniques and DT-PdM applications. Implementing DT-PdM in the framework of DT-PdM mainly involves three stages. First, the monitoring data in the physical layer is collected, including process data, equipment data, and product data, which is transmitted through wireless networks to edge devices and finally to the cloud. In this process, the transmission of high-volume multi-source data is a major concern due to the limitation of broadband and the computational cost of the cloud computer. Hence, the cloud-edge collaboration that adopts ML techniques can be a potential solution. In the cloud-edge collaboration of DT-PdM, the data sampling strategy can be optimized, and the sensor data can be pre-processed to extract the key features to lower the data transmission load. Finally, with the information obtained from DT, advanced ML algorithms such as deep learning can be used for fault diagnosis and RUL prediction modeling. The results can be used to optimize the decision-making in PdM such as maintenance planning, spare parts management, and job scheduling. In the modeling of fault diagnosis and RUL prediction, several challenges such as data imbalance, the reasoning of the fault root cause, and the unseen tasks transfer learning can be addressed by the collaboration of ML and DT. DT can be used to simulate and generate data samples for the minority faulty class and the unseen tasks. Meanwhile, the DT can be used to verify the fault root cause identified by the ML algorithms. 4.2 Machine learning for health indicator construction and remaining useful life prediction 4.2.1 Overview of health indicator and remaining useful life prediction Both HI and RUL prediction are essential in PdM. RUL prediction is concerned with estimating the remaining operational lifespan of a machine, whereas HI prediction focuses on quantifying the overall health condition. The RUL prediction provides a time-based estimation, indicating how much time is left before failure, while the HI provides a numerical value representing the health level. HI construction can be used as an input or feature for RUL prediction models. By considering the HI value along with other relevant features, RUL prediction models can consider the current health condition of the machine to improve the accuracy of the remaining life estimation. The construction of HI relies heavily on subjective assessments which can reveal the damage level of the component or system. The problem of ambiguity leads to challenges in the accuracy of the RUL prediction. Therefore, the construction of multi-stage equipment degradation trends through HI to aid RUL prediction may be a suitable approach [89], by splitting the multi-stage degradation state and using multi-model predictions instead of single-model predictions with low accuracy, so this section will illustrate the construction of a combined HI and RUL model based on DT. In conjunction with the application of HI, HI consists of three main attributes: (1) Detectability: As different fault levels reflect different HI knowledge, the sensitivity of the HI is important and the best HI is assessed by the ability to detect the smallest fault type, which is often related to the construction of the fault characteristics [90]. (2) Separability: The aim is to distinguish between fault and non-fault types and to have realistic and reliable results [90]. (3) Trendability: the degradation of a component after a failure can be positively correlated with the running time and the fitting error is within acceptable limits, and the results are optimized continuously using a suitable evaluation matrix [91]. The construction of an HI is therefore essential and is considered to be optimal once it has achieved the requirements of detectability, separability, and Trendability. 4.2.2 Machine learning for health indicator construction There are two primary types of HI-based construction: statistical-based models and ML-based models. Historically, HI was based on a statistically driven approach to modeling. For example, index-based transient maintenance targets simple components like bearings by extracting statistical parameters from monitoring signals to derive trend characteristics like root mean square (RMS), which reflects energy or amplitude and represents the health state [92]. However, researchers have found that RMS is affected by various operating conditions and is not very resistant to interference, making it unsuitable as a direct indicator of component HI [93]. The statistical-based approach to HI construction requires researchers to make human observations or discoveries of degradation trends, which can be time-consuming and subject to the variability of the parts being studied. To overcome these challenges, ML techniques can be employed to mine correlated degradation knowledge for HI. ML techniques are currently a popular research topic for building HI. However, due to the limitations of current statistical parameters, the knowledge-mining presentation of the mechanisms may be incomplete. To address this, researchers have proposed constructing HI using a fusion of ML techniques. For example, Widodo fused peak, kurtosis, and entropy using principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction to construct HI [94]. Saidi et al. established a filtered detection method and successfully applied it to the HI construction of wind turbine bearings [95]. Moshrefzadeh et al. proposed spectral amplitude modulation that uses SVM and subspace k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) to calculate the impulsivity of signals and determine the state of health of the machine [96]. Mosallam et al. used features extracted in the time domain frequency domain and used principle component analysis models to construct HI [97]. These ML-based approaches demonstrate the ability to bridge gaps in statistical knowledge mining and information fusion, highlighting their potential in addressing HI construction methods. In DT-PdM, DT can generate key features that are relevant to the machine's health status. By simulating the behavior of the physical asset in a virtual environment, DT captures and represents various aspects of the machine's operation, performance, and condition. These captured features can be further used in HI estimation modeling. Meanwhile, the HI is a virtual metric that is hard to be directly evaluated. The simulation and visualization function of DT can be helpful in the evaluation of HI. 4.2.3 Machine learning for remaining useful life prediction On the other hand, RUL prediction is a crucial technique in equipment management, which involves building mathematical and simulation models to predict the future state and operating trends of a system by combining various observations [80,98]. According to Salunkhe et al., RUL is the time remaining before the equipment fails in operation, obtained by building models based on the current age, condition, and past operating conditions of the equipment [99]. Initially, researchers classified these approaches as physical model-based, data-based, and hybrid-based. However, as research on RUL prediction continued, researchers further classified data-driven approaches as artificial intelligence model-based and statistical methods [100]. Currently, statistical-based models, physically-driven models, and data-driven models are being explored by researchers. The core principle of physical models for RUL prediction is to develop a mathematical model of the degradation trend of a mechanical component by considering its failure mechanism or damage principle. This requires the consolidation of various sources of information, including physical experiments and FEA. While physical-based models require a complete understanding of the failure mechanism of the equipment and the setting of effective parameters to achieve accurate estimation, they may limit the extension and application of the method for some complex mechanical systems. Statistical model-based RUL prediction focuses on building a statistical model from a large amount of empirical knowledge and deriving the RUL model from observations. The classical approach is autoregressive (AR) model which assumes future state values and measures the error of a linear function of observed and run values [101]. The data-driven RUL prediction focuses on utilizing ML techniques to uncover trends in mechanical degradation rather than relying on physical or statistical models. Various deep learning techniques have been used for RUL prediction. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used for RUL prediction because of their ability to handle explicit time series data. Zemouri et al. proposed a recurrent radial basis function network and used it to predict the RUL of mechanical components [102]. Hybrid method-based RUL prediction has also been proposed, integrating the advantages of different methods to construct integrated degradation models. However, there are relatively few studies in this category. Some researchers have used multiple prediction methods by fusing different strategies to build hybrid integrated prediction frameworks. For example, Zemouri et al. combined ANN with AR models to develop a hybrid approach [102]. Fig. 5 illustrates a line graph showing the number of papers published on developing HI and RUL prediction models using ML indexed by Google Scholar from 2001 to 2022. Although this data may not capture all publications and could potentially include non-academic publications, this proportion provides a valuable reference, indicating a significant increase in the importance of ML in developing HI and RUL prediction models. It can be seen that 2010 and 2017 are two accelerating points. The publication trends of both HI and RUL prediction are similar to the developing trend of deep learning in this period. Meanwhile, it is obvious that the research of RUL outweighed that of HI in the last decades. With the development of DT, the research of HI can be beneficial and the number of publications can be promoted. 4.2.4 Leveraging health indicator construction and remaining useful life prediction with digital twin HI construction and RUL prediction are the main tasks in PdM. The application of DT techniques can enhance the accuracy of HI and RUL prediction, as production environments can vary significantly, resulting in low model accuracy [49]. Fig. 6 illustrates the process of DT-driven HI and RUL prediction. The figure encompasses five distinct stages: data collection, communication, DT mapping, behavior prediction, and DT updating. Each stage plays a vital role in facilitating accurate and efficient PdM practices. Stage 1: Multi-source data including sensor data, simulation data, and statistical data is collected for analysis and modeling. The cloud computer set up the data collection plan according to the feature importance in ML. The collection plan is then sent to the edge device including the required features, and sampling frequency. Finally, the specific data required by the cloud platform is transmitted to the cloud platform. Stage 2: Updating different models including geometric model, data analytics model and physics model to achieve high fidelity mappings with the real-world asset. The geometric model can be updated via the analysis of the shape data such as point-cloud data. The data analytics models can be calibrated and updated via incremental learning or continuous learning. Meanwhile, ML can be used to discover new knowledge of physics which can update the physics model. Stage 3: Data fusion is implemented to fuse the data from different sources. After the monitoring data is used to update the DT, the key features relevant to the asset health status such as wear degree and crack dimension are estimated using DT simulation. The simulated data, monitoring data and statistical data is then fused using advanced ML technique. Stage 4: The fused data is then used for HI and RUL prediction modeling. The prevailing deep learning algorithm is then deployed to construct a HI model based on the fused data. Then the predicted HI is used to estimate the RUL based on the HI curve construed in DT. Stage 5: Based on the HI and RUL prediction, the asset performance in DT is evaluated and the optimal maintenance plan and the job schedule are determined in DT. ML techniques such as reinforcement learning can be adopted to optimize maintenance planning, which can achieve the lowest maintenance cost and machine down time. 4.3 Fault diagnosis based on machine learning With the increasing use of smart devices, health management technology has become crucial for building fault diagnosis models using monitoring data. Fault diagnosis involves monitoring equipment's operating status and analyzing the failure mechanism after a fault or anomaly has occurred. Anomaly detection has been widely studied in PdM. However, it's worth noting that anomaly detection often overlaps with fault diagnosis [103]. Both are essentially classification tasks: while anomaly detection classifies operational data into 'normal' or 'anomalous', fault diagnosis often extends this by classifying the specific type or cause of the anomaly. Hence, the anomaly detection tasks were classified into fault diagnosis in this study. Advanced fault prediction using intelligent technology can help enterprises manage and reduce costs [13]. However, building such models requires a combination of experienced domain knowledge. ML has emerged as a prevalent approach for intelligent fault diagnosis, utilizing ML and deep learning networks to model collected data and learn machine diagnostic knowledge adaptively. This approach replaces the previous reliance on engineer experience and knowledge for equipment maintenance [104]. 4.3.1 Machine learning for fault diagnosis ML-based fault diagnosis was one of the early applications of intelligent fault diagnosis. For instance, Wong et al. proposed an improved self-organizing mapping for bearing fault diagnosis. With the advance of deep learning, the performance of fault diagnosis has improved greatly. Liu et al. and Lu et al. used stacked sparse AE and stacked denoising AE to apply fault diagnosis to bearings with higher accuracy than SVM and other methods [105,106]. CNN can capture the key faulty features from the input data. CNN was successfully constructed for diagnostic models of rolling element bearings, gears, motors, and hydraulic pumps [107]. The attention mechanism is also a hot topic in the development of fault diagnosis. The introduction of an attention mechanism can help models autonomously assign learning weights and offsets to learn important information and ignore unimportant information, such as spatial attention [108\u2013110] and channel attention [111,112]. In real industrial scenarios, healthy data can be easily collected, but the amount of faulty data often falls short of the requirement, which poses a challenge for building reliable diagnostic models. Therefore, transfer learning has been introduced to facilitate the application of fault diagnosis in engineering scenarios, such as transfer component analysis [113], joint distribution adaptive [114], and novel sparse de-noising AE [76]. The role of ML in fault diagnosis applications has become increasingly important and has evolved toward general-purpose models [115]. This section mainly reviews the development of ML in fault diagnosis from conventional ML-based fault diagnosis to deep learning-based fault diagnosis. Transfer learning is a prevailing deep learning technique, which is helpful in fault diagnosis [116]. It is also expected to extend from academic research to industrial scenarios, reducing the cost of large amounts of labeled data by reusing diagnostic knowledge across multiple related domains to solve problems [75,113]. TrAdaboost is a transfer learning algorithm that originated from Adaboost, and Shen et al. used cross-domain features to train a set of k-NN- based diagnostic models through the TrAdabost algorithm [117]. Similarly, Cao et al. proposed a deep CNN-based fault diagnosis model for gearboxes, where the authors constructed a 24-layer CNN model and trained it using ImageNet datasets, and used transfer learning techniques to select parameters to pre-train themselves on another CNN diagnostic model [118]. In summary, the application of ML-based fault diagnosis methods has grown exponentially over time, with a gradual shift from traditional statistical methods to ML methods in the construction of fault diagnosis models. The widespread interest and application of transfer learning techniques suggest a potential shift towards the development of more generic models that can be used across multiple related domains. As the field continues to evolve, it is expected that the development of more sophisticated algorithms and models will lead to even more accurate and efficient fault diagnosis systems, ultimately improving the safety and reliability of industrial equipment. 4.3.2 Leveraging fault diagnosis model construction with digital twin The construction of fault diagnosis models using ML faces various challenges, such as data imbalance and poor data quality. The emergence of DT has played a significant role in addressing these challenges by assisting in data pre-processing. This has, in turn, facilitated the development of fault diagnosis based on DT applications, with a particular focus on the role of DT techniques in predictive model establishment [72,119]. DT-based fault diagnosis may be able to provide effective observation data and facilitate data fusion techniques such as knowledge graphs to build models based on field environmental monitoring observations of field exploration relationships [71]. In terms of data pre-processing, traditional data collection may lead to missing values, data interruptions and other problems due to many technical reasons such as hardware equipment, and transmission protocols. DT can address these problems to some extent through virtual worlds instead of traditional methods such as replacing missing values with mean values to improve accuracy. Additionally, insufficient fault data is a great challenge in fault diagnosis modeling using ML. DT can generate faulty samples to address the unbalanced number of fault types instead of traditional modeling using over-sampling [120] and under-sampling [121] to improve model accuracy. With the advance of deep transfer learning, few-shot fault diagnosis can be achieved, while it still cannot address the unseen fault diagnosis challenge. However, DT-driven fault diagnosis can address this issue by generating faulty samples based on DT. The process of DT-driven unseen fault diagnosis using deep transfer learning is illustrated in Fig. 7. With the high-fidelity DT, the characteristic and performance of unseen fault can be simulated and the high-quality data samples for the unseen fault can be obtained. Then deep transfer learning can be deployed for the unseen fault diagnosis modeling. DT-based fault diagnosis also facilitates the fault root cause reasoning. In a complex asset, it is challenging to identify the root cause. In DT, the correlation between the components and the sub-system can be identified, which can be transformed into a graph representation. Advanced graph neural network algorithms can then be used to build a node classification model so to identify the root cause of the fault. Meanwhile, external knowledge from the fault diagnosis knowledge graph also can be introduced into DT to enhance the fault root cause reasoning capability [122]. With the introduction of knowledge graph, DT-driven fault diagnosis can benefit from a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of the system. The knowledge graph serves as a powerful tool for root cause analysis by capturing and organizing domain knowledge and enabling the exploration and discovery of complex fault mechanisms. 5 Challenges and opportunities Based on the analysis and discussion in the previous sections, there are some challenges identified in DT-PdM. (1) The complexity of DT-PdM systems requires high-fidelity modeling, but only a few studies have considered and explored this, with most researchers only modeling DT-PdM for a single component without considering the high-fidelity of the model; (2) Most of the articles collected data from a variety of sources including physical information collection, but there are few descriptions of data fusion for different levels of DT-PdM, only integrating and modeling the data collected from multiple sources; (3) To improve the generality of the model, some of the articles use physics knowledge for modeling but do not effectively combine ML techniques, which may not effectively establish an ML model; (4) Most researchers mainly focus on ML modeling, while a suitable low-latency interactive cloud-edge collaboration solution to deploy DT-PdM applications has not been considered. Therefore, in response to the above issues raised in the collected articles, this section presents future challenges and opportunities in four areas: ML for high-fidelity digital model construction, multi-source data fusion, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) for DT-PdM and cloud-edge collaboration for low latency interaction to address the current research gaps. 5.1 Machine learning for high-fidelity digital model construction This section outlines an approach for developing high-fidelity models of DT for PdM, while also summarizing the current challenges and opportunities in this field. The process of modeling high-fidelity DT for PdM can be divided into three main steps: geometric model annotation, high-fidelity reality mapping, and qualitative and quantitative evaluation of high-fidelity models. The first step involves accurately representing the true geometry of the physical space using aids such as CAD and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) techniques for geometry annotation. Different types of annotation, including product design information, definition information, basic metadata information, functional information, parametric information, and static structure, can be utilized to achieve an accurate representation of the physical space. The existing studies have conducted the data synthetic using the virtual geometric model, which can be used for the tasks in PdM [9,10,21,28,29,35,36,45,46,49,58,66,69\u201382]. Furthermore, ML algorithms can facilitate continuous learning and adaptation of the DT as new data from the physical asset is available. By updating the models and retraining them with the latest information, the DT can continuously improve its performance and fidelity over time. This allows for a dynamic and evolving representation of the physical asset's behavior. Meanwhile, ML can be applied to learn and optimize the behavior of the DT. By training the models on historical data and observed outcomes, ML algorithms can discover complex patterns, relationships, and dependencies within the system. This enables the DT to simulate and predict the behavior of the physical asset with higher fidelity and accuracy. Meanwhile, the construction of a high-fidelity model must be evaluated. Since the virtual model differs from the physical entity in general and the DT model usually consists of several sub-models, evaluating the results of the ML model with a single quantitative indicator can be challenging. Therefore, the high-fidelity DT model construction needs to be further investigated. 5.2 Multi-source data fusion in DT-PdM In the DT-PdM, the collected data comes from various sources such as sensors, IoT devices, maintenance logs, and external databases. After the multi-source data is collected, the data needs to be integrated and analyzed. However, none of the existing studies identifies the approaches for integrating the multi-source data and extracting the salient features for DT-PdM. By fusing data from multiple sources, the DT can provide a more comprehensive view of the asset's health status, which can bring tangible benefits to the PdM. There are several challenges in the multi-source data fusion for DT- PdM. Firstly, these data sources may have different formats, structures, and quality levels. Handling the heterogeneity of data requires advanced ML techniques for data pre-processing, normalization, and transformation to ensure compatibility and consistency across different sources. Secondly, the quality and reliability of data from different sources can vary significantly. Some sources may provide accurate and reliable data, while others may be prone to errors, noise, or missing values. Dealing with data quality issues and developing methods to identify and handle unreliable or faulty data is crucial for accurate data fusion and subsequent predictive maintenance analysis. Thirdly, the data fusion of multi-sources data while maintaining synchronization and temporal coherence is essential for accurate analysis. Different data sources may have different sampling rates, time stamps, and event triggers. Aligning and synchronizing data from various sources is critical to ensure meaningful fusion and analysis. In the multi-source data fusion, a potential tool in facilitating this integration is the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) [123]. The AAS provides a standardized interface for integrating data and services across various sources, ensuring seamless data fusion by encapsulating assets in information models, thus addressing different information contexts with uniformity. Furthermore, another useful tool in multi-source data fusion is manufacturing middleware [124], which can play a substantial role in bridging the heterogeneous data environments. Manufacturing middleware ensures that disparate data formats, structures, and quality levels are homogenized, providing a consistent platform for further analysis in the DT-PdM framework. Overall, it is worthwhile to investigate multi-source data fusion in the DT for PdM, which can improve the accuracy, timeliness, and comprehensiveness of maintenance decisions. 5.3 Physics-informed machine learning for digital twin-driven predictive maintenance To address the challenge of insufficient data volume in PdM for equipment failures, as well as to improve model generalization and ensure the physical soundness of results, PIML is a promising approach. In this section, the advantages of PIML-driven models and the challenges that may arise in the future from three perspectives [125] are introduced. The training of ML models for PdM may require several components, including data, model architecture, optimization algorithms, and inference methods. Physical priors can be integrated into one or more of these components to improve performance. Firstly, for problems with constraints or related equations, data can be augmented or integrated, models can learn from this generated data, and physical knowledge can be reused to improve predictions compared to using only raw data. Additionally, the integration of physical knowledge may lead to a reduced need for data in the training process when applying PIML methods. Secondly, as the integration of physical knowledge may exhibit periodic or other physical patterns, the generality of the problem-solving can be enhanced, enabling the construction of a generic network model architecture. Finally, in model optimization, the optimization objective can integrate physical knowledge to reshape the optimization space and help the training process converge. However, despite these advantages, PIML still faces several challenges in the future. Firstly, PIML requires relevant knowledge about the domain of PdM to select the appropriate physical knowledge for integration and to promote flexibility in the selection of physical knowledge. Secondly, due to the complexity of the equipment system architecture and fault information, there is a lack of evaluation of PIML methods for equipment failures and a lack of evaluation of various fault knowledge integration methods. Finally, in PIML, the loss function and optimization approach need to be designed to incorporate and enforce the physical laws or governing equations of the problem being solved. A suitable loss function and optimization approach can ensure that the neural network learns and respects the underlying physics, leading to more accurate and physically consistent predictions. Hence, PIML is a promising approach for addressing challenges in DT-PdM, but several challenges need to be further researched. 5.4 Cloud-edge collaboration for low latency interaction When deploying ML in DT-PdM, concerns over latency and cloud-edge collaboration arise. DT-PdM relies on timely and accurate information to make informed decisions regarding asset health and maintenance actions. Low latency allows for rapid data processing, analysis, and decision-making at the edge, enabling real-time responses to critical events and minimizing downtime. This is particularly important in scenarios where immediate actions are required to prevent equipment failure or mitigate potential risks. Edge computing brings computational resources closer to the data source, reducing the latency involved in sending data to the cloud for processing. By leveraging the capability of data analytics in edge devices, data can be processed and analyzed locally, enabling faster insights and reducing the dependency on cloud resources. Low latency facilitates efficient utilization of edge computing capabilities, enabling quick response times and reducing the need for extensive data transfers to the cloud. In order to achieve low latency in the cloud-edge collaboration of DT-PdM, several challenges need to be addressed. Firstly, edge devices often have limited computational power, memory, and energy resources. Running sophisticated machine learning algorithms on resource-constrained devices can be a challenge, requiring optimization techniques and efficient resource allocation strategies. Hence, lightweight and effective ML algorithms need to be explored. Secondly, DT-PdM involves processing and analyzing a large volume of data generated by numerous edge devices. Distributed ML algorithms for numerous edge devices can be a potential solution to achieve satisfactory performance with lower latency. The scheme of distributed ML in the DT-PdM deserves more attention in the future. Finally, the security and privacy of data in a cloud-edge collaboration are crucial. The need to transmit sensitive data between the cloud and edge devices while ensuring secure communication and preventing unauthorized access adds complexity to achieving low latency. Overcoming these challenges requires leveraging technologies such as advanced ML and edge computing techniques to achieve low latency in cloud-edge collaboration for DT-PdM. 6 Conclusions ML techniques have made considerable contributions to DT for PdM applications, such as fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, HI construction and, to varying degrees, to DT techniques and PdM applications.

In agriculture, precise fertilization and effective nutrient management are critical. Machine learning (ML) has recently been increasingly used to develop decision support tools for modern agricultural systems, including nutrient management, to improve yields while reducing expenses and environmental impact. ML based systems require huge amounts of data from different platforms to handle non-linear tasks and build predictive models that can improve agricultural productivity. This study reviews machine learning based techniques for estimating fertilizer and nutrient status that have been developed in the last decade. A thorough investigation of detection and classification approaches was conducted, which served as the basis for a detailed assessment of the key challenges that remain to be addressed. The research findings suggest that rapid improvements in machine learning and sensor technology can provide cost-effective and thorough nutrient assessment and decision-making solutions. Future research directions are also recommended to improve the practical application of this technology. Keywords Fertilization Nutrient management Machine learning 1 Introduction Agriculture is the main source of food, income, and employment for developing countries and their rural populations, especially in Africa Preethi et al. (2020); Tapsoba et al. (2020); Collier and Dercon (2014); Rejeb et al. (2022). Given current population growth, pressure on agricultural systems will continue to increase Kamilaris et al. (2017); Bharath et al. (2022). Many countries are agrarian and their economies are based primarily on agricultural productivity Salami et al. (2010); Livingston et al. (2011). African agriculture, for example, is influenced by various factors such as climate, geography, water scarcity, spatial variability of soils, and policies Aworka et al. (2022); Diao et al. (2010); Olanipekun et al. (2019); Jayne et al. (2010). Despite the population explosion and increasing demand in the last century, farmers still suffer from large economic losses due to under-fertilization Chivenge et al. (2022); Jha et al. (2019). Although the amount and quality of experimental data is constantly increasing, researchers are still unable to integrate it, analyze it, and make the best decisions possible. Modern agriculture proves that the introduction of new technologies has solved many problems that farmers have faced in the last decades Liakos et al. (2018); Patr\u00edcio and Rieder (2018); Adnan et al. (2019); Elavarasan et al. (2018); Babaie Sarijaloo et al. (2021). Technology transfer centers that promote the adoption of new agricultural management practices and the use of sensors, drones, and low-cost satellite imagery for pest control and better fertilization should help improve the welfare of smallholder farmers Kuijpers and Swinnen (2016); Holzworth et al. (2015). The rise of new data-intensive scientific fields has led to this modern agriculture, which now generates large amounts of data due to the multitude of sensors deployed in experimental fields. Traditional data processing techniques are not up to the ever-increasing demands of smart agriculture, making it difficult to extract useful information from numerous field experiments and soil tests. Machine learning (ML) is an emerging technology that can help discover patterns in large data sets Sarker (2021). This technology makes predictions directly from given data Ayodele (2010); Singh et al. (2016). ML Algorithms can predict yields using fertilizer rates, genetic data, and environmental and land management variables. Advances in machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, are benefiting agriculture. The digital transformation of agriculture is evolving in parallel with artificial intelligence systems in various aspects, optimizing the ever-growing data coming from numerous sources, not only in crop disease detection, which has received the most attention from data scientists Barbedo (2019). In the area of nutrient management, it is possible to integrate and interpolate various pieces of information that have never been explored for this purpose before. This improves the overall understanding of agricultural systems, including nutrient requirements, and also allows economic aspects to be incorporated into decisions. Accurate diagnosis of current crop nutritional status and nutrient requirements plays a critical role in overall farm management and impacts not only the environment, but also the economic sustainability of the farm Goulding et al. (2008); Monaghan et al. (2007); Fairhurst et al. (2007); Dhal et al. (2022). Yield loss, under-utilization of natural resources, decline in soil organic carbon content (OC), lower carbon use, and other problems can be caused by either nutrient excess or deficiency. Accurate diagnosis would benefit farmers on many levels, including yields, fertilizer recommendations, and revenue. In this paper, we review ML based fertilizer estimation and nutrient status algorithms developed in the last decade. Commonalities in this area are identified, weaknesses are discussed, and possible solutions and future perspectives are proposed. A thorough review of detection and classification approaches was conducted, which served as the basis for a detailed assessment of key challenges that remain to be addressed. This review is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common machine-learning algorithms, feature selection approaches, and performance metrics used in the reviewed work. In Section 3, the most common features for nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation studies and the methodology for study selection are presented, along with the ML-based algorithms used by each approach. Finally, Section 4 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using ML in nutrient management. 2 Machine learning Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence in which the computer, referred to as a machine, learns to perform various tasks automatically Venkataraju et al. (2023). ML combines mathematical modeling and complex algorithms to perform tasks by learning from existing data. ML has been successfully applied in many fields that require classification, prediction, and recommendations Abioye et al. (2022). For example, it provides farmers with soil quality monitoring tools and personalized recommendations based on experimental and field data. ML uses features extracted from known experimental input data to develop models capable of predicting the desired outcome from new data. Machine learning can be divided into three main categories supervised learning, unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning depending on the desired outcome El Allali et al. (2021). In supervised learning, an input is mapped to an output based on a training dataset Venkataraju et al. (2023), as shown in Fig. 1 . In the case of regression, the output is a value, while the output of classification is a class. Unlike supervised learning, which is task-oriented, unsupervised learning is data-oriented, meaning that the goal is to identify patterns in data sets based on a set of features Rainville et al. (2014). One of the most common applications of unsupervised learning models is clustering, where data with similar patterns are grouped into clusters. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has gained traction in the machine learning world as computational power is no longer a hurdle Ahmad et al. (2022); Durai and Shamili (2022). DL is used in either supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised environments. Unlike the algorithms of classical ML, which often require pre-processing of data, Deep Learning can bypass this step and is therefore better suited for unstructured data such as images. The data is often used directly, eliminating the human factor and automating the feature extraction step. A key advantage of DL is its ability to analyze huge unlabeled datasets, making it an invaluable tool for Big Data Analytics Najafabadi et al. (2015). 2.1 Machine learning algorithms With advances in machine learning algorithms, even the most complicated regression and classification problems can now be solved Tesfaye et al. (2021). In addition, many of the algorithms are available on a number of open source platforms designed specifically for ML. Regression is a part of supervised learning that provides a prediction of an output variable as a function of input variables that are usually known and available in these subcategories. There are many algorithms used in almost all fields, e.g., linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), logistic regression, and stepwise regression. Many complex algorithms have seen the light of day to solve much more complex problems, such as multivariate adaptive regression splines. Classification is another important type of supervised learning that uses models to predict a discrete label instead of a continuous output. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an algorithm that classifies data instances by constructing a linear separation hyperplane John et al. (2020); Karimi et al. (2006). To improve classification, SVMs use a kernel function to transform the original feature space into a higher-dimensional feature space. Classification, regression, and grouping have all been performed with SVMs. SVMs are useful in a variety of applications because they overcome the difficulties of overfitting that occur in high-dimensional spaces and are based on global optimization. Support Vector Regression, Least Squares Support Vector Machine and Successive Projection Algorithm Support Vector Machine are the most commonly used SVM algorithms. Decision tree (DT) based algorithms use trees to gradually group the dataset into smaller homogeneous subsets (subpopulations) while creating an associated tree graph. Each branch of the tree graph displays the result of a particular pairwise comparison for a particular attribute, while each internal node represents the comparison itself. After following the path from root to leaf, the leaf nodes show the final judgment or prediction (expressed as a classification rule). The classification and regression trees, the automatic chi-square interaction detector, and the iterative dichotomizer are the most common learning techniques in this category. The Random Forest algorithm (RF) is also widely used and consists of a sequence of decision trees. The result predictions are combined for better predictive performance. DT can be either a regression algorithm or a classification algorithm and represents many suboptimal solutions. Based on a set of decision rules that follow a tree-like architecture, it can make recommendations based on classified data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are also supervised models commonly used for regression and classification Zupan (1994); Zou et al. (2008). ANNs use radial basis function networks, perceptron algorithms, and backpropagation to build predictive models Griffel et al. (2022). Deep ANNs, also called deep learning (DL) or deep neural networks (DNNs), are a relatively new branch of machine learning research that enables computer models to represent complex data at multiple levels of abstraction by using numerous processing operations Dharani et al. (2021). The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is also a well-known Deep Learning algorithm that was first used to classify images Wu (2017); Kattenborn et al. (2021). CNN creates an artificial neural network that can autonomously learn and make intelligent decisions by automatically extracting the most appropriate features from input sequences and layering techniques Al-Ajlan and El Allali (2018a); Farooque et al. (2023). One of the most attractive features of Deep Learning is that feature extraction is often performed by the model itself. DL Models have greatly improved prediction in several fields, including agriculture Subeesh et al. (2022); Raouhi et al. (2022); Bedi and Gole (2021); Paymode and Malode (2022). 2.2 Feature selection The first step in any ML experiment is to extract impactful features from the raw data Chandrashekar and Sahin (2014); Dash and Liu (1997). The goal of feature extraction is to find the most informative group of features (unique patterns) to improve the effectiveness of the classifier. Feature extraction, also called feature engineering, extracts features from the original data to achieve accurate classification. Feature extraction is an important step in ML as classification performance can decrease if features are not carefully selected Kebonye et al. (2022). Feature selection, commonly known as dimensionality reduction (DR), is a technique used in supervised and unsupervised learning to construct a reduced dimensional representation of a dataset while maintaining as much discriminative information as possible. To prevent the implications of excessive dimensionality, it is frequently used before building classification or regression models. There are many feature selection methods in supervised learning, classified into three categories, as shown in Fig. 2 . The most commonly used DR techniques are principal component analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS), and linear discriminate analysis (LDA). However, algorithms based on metaheuristic approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA) are gaining ground in the field of feature selection. The goal of feature selection is to extract all useful information from the data. The features are then used in the training phase to build the ML model. Feature selection chooses the smallest possible subset of features from the original set of features to maximize generalizability. Given many independent variables, the feature selection function selects a subset of variables on which to focus a learning algorithm. The model-based approach considers the correlation structure among predictors and assigns a value to each feature indicating how useful or important it is for model construction. The performance of the model would not be affected if features of little or no importance were eliminated. To reduce dimension and select the most acceptable features for classification, dimension reduction can be paired with a feature extraction algorithm Al-Ajlan and El Allali (2018b). On the other hand, Deep Learning uses an alternative architecture that incorporates the process of feature extraction from the data into the learning phase LeCun et al. (2015); Al-Ajlan and El Allali (2018a). This crucial step has a significant impact on the results, as it can improve the performance of the model by removing unnecessary and redundant features. The model becomes less complicated and the likelihood of bias and error is decreased by reducing overfitting. The model gives more realistic recommendations by selecting the most relevant features. 2.3 Performance metrics In order to measure the performance of machine learning algorithms, several performance metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision F-Measure, and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) are commonly used as performance metrics. In this section, we describe the metrics that have been used in most studies included in this review such as the coefficient of determination R 2 , the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean square error. R 2 , or the coefficient of determination, evaluates the proportion of the variance of the target variable that is explained by the model, as shown in Eq. (1): (1) R 2 = 1 \u2212 \u2211 i = 1 n yi \u2212 y ^ i 2 \u2211 i = 1 n yi \u2212 y \u00af i 2 Yi is the observed value of the target variable, y ^ i is the predicted value of the target variable, and y \u00af i represents the mean of the observed target variables. The highest possible value for R 2 is one, which means that the model is 100% accurate. However, this value can also be negative if the model produces slightly worse predictions. In the case of R 2 = 0 , the model is constant and always predicts the expected value of y, ignoring the input feature. Most often, values above 0.5 are considered good. MAE or Mean Absolute Error is the average of the absolute difference between the observation and the predicted value, as shown in Eq. (2): (2) MAE = 1 n \u2211 i = 1 n yi \u2212 y ^ i The root-mean-square error ( RMSE ), as shown in Eq. (3), assigns a high weight to large errors due to squaring. When the value is equal to 0, the model is considered to have the best fit. MAE is less sensitive to large errors than R 2 and RMSE because equal weight is given to each error. (3) RMSE = 1 n \u2211 i = 1 n yi \u2212 y ^ i 2 3 ML based algorithms for nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation This section describes various machine learning algorithms used in the area of nutrient management and fertilizer recommendations. This review focuses primarily on the current state-of-the-art ML techniques for nutrient management and fertilizer recommendation. It addresses the many factors that influence yield and how machine learning could help predict fertilizer recommendations. Table 1 and Table 2 show a selection of articles from the literature on this topic. An extensive search was conducted to select relevant studies that use machine learning for nutritional management of cropping systems. In the first step, keywords such as \u201cnutrient management\u201d, \u201cmachine learning in agriculture\u201d, \u201cfertilizer forecasting\u201d were used in various combinations including \u201cmachine learning in nutrient management\u201d, \u201cfertilizer recommendation tools with machine learning\u201d for a broad search through Science Direct, Pubmed, and Scopus. At a first level, publications were classified into two general categories: Nitrogen Management and Nitrogen Phosphorous Potassium (NPK) Management. Only articles published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. Although climate prediction is critical to agricultural productivity, it is not covered in this review because machine learning applications to climate prediction are part of a separate area of study. Finally, all articles covered here were selected for the period from 2010 to July 2022 and found to be all within the scope of this work. 3.1 Most common features The best nutrient management strategies are predicted based on a set of characteristics Khanal et al. (2018); Jian et al. (2020). For example, 17 nutrients are necessary for optimal crop development, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. They are all equally important to crops, although their proportions are constantly changing. Because of these variations, the availability of nutrients in the soil affects plant growth, as the soil is the most important source of these nutrients for plants. If any of these nutrients are lacking, crop yield is reduced. In addition to the nutrients already mentioned, the following section discusses some other common features that can be divided into three categories: Climate is one of the most misunderstood factors in crop development Crane-Droesch (2018); Cai et al. (2019); Newlands et al. (2014). Although it may not appear so at first glance, water availability has a significant impact on agricultural productivity. Even low levels of rainfall can have a detrimental effect on crops, and production can fluctuate significantly due to extreme variations in rainfall amounts and periods. On the other hand, weather conditions are more complicated than just a rainy or dry climate. There are a number of climate features to consider. Total daily and annual precipitation, high-yield and well-distributed precipitation, and the Shannon diversity index (SDI) for precipitation are some of the most common. Other characteristics include daily maximum and minimum temperatures and total solar radiation, pest infestation under various atmospheric conditions and weather patterns. Algorithms for nutrient management include soil type and texture, organic matter, pH, accessible and exchangeable nutrients, total inorganic and organic carbon, and the total capacity of a soil to hold exchangeable cations (CEC). Qin et al. (2018) created two additional characteristics: a water table-adjusted available water capacity (AWCwt) and a ratio of cumulative seasonal precipitation to AWCwt (RAWCwt). Both features are used to reflect field-level hydrologic conditions and are dependent on conditions that are meant to showcase how soil hydrology impacts nitrogen dynamics. Taking into consideration that the amount of nitrogen lost under wet conditions is considered significantly negative for a soil's ability to store water beyond the saturated zone, which is generally equal to the depth of the water table. Several soil management variables are considered and used as harvest management features: Planting date and density, date of nitrogen application (both at planting and side-dress application), grain yield, harvest key, fresh and dry biomass, fertilizer rate, and nutrient uptake Ahmed et al. (2021). The information contained in the red and near-infrared (NIR) canopy radiances is used mainly in common vegetation indices: Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI)[4] and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)[5]. (4) RVI = \u03c1RED \u03c1NIR (5) NDVI = \u03c1NIR \u2212 \u03c1RED \u03c1NIR + \u03c1RED Where \u03c1RED and \u03c1NIR represent the spectral radiances in the red and NIR regions, respectively. These indices increase the contrast between the ground and vegetation while reducing illumination effects. 3.2 Nitrogen management based systems In recent years, many applications of nutrient management models have surfaced, especially regarding nitrogen recommendations, as it is considered very important for yield estimation Puntel et al. (2016); Dai et al. (2013); Castaldi et al. (2016); Shi et al. (2021). In the present time, the implementation of ML techniques for N management can be divided into different approaches such as EONR and NNI determination, remote sensing and spectroscopy. Determining the economically optimal amount of nitrogen can be influenced by various factors such as rainfall and management practices. Advances in ML paved the way for better Economic Optimum Nitrogen Rate (EONR) predictions that take these various parameters into account. Qin et al. (2018) looked at the prediction of EONR from field trial data at two different time points: i) seeding, ii) split application time points. Model-derived features such as AWCwt and RAWCwt and weather data were used to build the prediction algorithm. RR provided better results compared to LR, LASSO and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT). However, the results of this study cannot be generalized due to the limited data sets. Ransom et al. (2019) evaluated the ability of a set of machine learning and statistical algorithms to improve nitrogen recommendations for corn using measured soil properties along with weather variables from 49 sites in the Midwestern United States. The authors examined different modeling scenarios for improving three different nitrogen recommendation tools and tested whether adjustments for multicollinearity and accounting for the interaction between soil and weather parameters would result in improvements. Performance was evaluated using the out-of-sample RMSE and included soil and weather data prior to each nitrogen recommendation tool. RF provided better nitrogen recommendations, but compared to the performance of the models in terms of number of variables, the decision tree provided the best fit with the smallest number of variables. The results showed that reducing multicollinearity slightly improved the performance of the different ML algorithms. The objective of a study by Correndo et al. (2021) was defining the importance of soil, weather conditions, and cropping management in estimating and magnifying uncertainty in key components affecting the nitrogen response of corn yield. When yield without fertilizer, Yield at Economic Optimum N Rate (YEONR), and nitrogen fertilizer efficiency (NFE) are considered in EONR. Bayesian statistics were used for the N response curves fitting along with Extreme Gradient Boosting that evaluates the importance of the traits in the predictability process. EONR was the most difficult attribute to estimate, with an average uncertainty of 50 kg N ha-1. Weather accounted for about two-thirds of the variation in estimated values for YEONR, EONR, and NFE. Uncertainty in all aspects of the N response mechanism was also influenced by weather conditions (72% to 81%). With a constant but moderate contribution, soil factors explained both the predicted N response and the associated uncertainty (10% to 23%). Model uncertainty as a form of risk, potential seasonal weather predictions, and the development of probabilistic frameworks to optimize this data-driven decision process for corn nitrogen application should be considered in improving nitrogen decision support systems. Wang et al. (2021b) investigated the possibility of improving in-season N-nutrient index (NNI) along with corn grain yield prediction by combining management, soil, and weather data with\u2019GreenSeeker\u2019 data, an optical sensor that instantaneously measures crop health and vigor using NDVI. RFR was compared to Lasso linear regression (LLR), which contains similar combined data from multiple sources, and to the simple regression model, which uses only plant data. Studies of corn nitrogen fertilization and crop density were conducted at four sites in northeastern China. Using the RFR model to predict grain yield to simulate the response of corn grain yield response to a range of nitrogen fertilizer applications at different growth stages is an innovative method for seasonal nitrogen fertilizer recommendations that have been developed. The simulated results were as good as the measured results. The RFR model-based recommendation technique, which combines crop sensing data with soil data, is a promising avenue for corn nitrogen management. To improve machine learning-based N recommendation for seasonal seeding, additional data from the year of the site, varying conditions on the farm, and sensors with more spectral ranges are needed. Similarly, data from the RapidSCAN active canopy sensor was also combined with Genetic*Environmental*Management (G*E*M) information to increase the accuracy of NNI estimation in the Midwestern U.S. under a variety of weather, management and soil variables Li et al. (2022); Qiu et al. (2021) presented that conventional methods for monitoring nitrogen nutrient index (NNI) require manual real field measurement data, which is time-consuming and costly, red-green-blue (RGB) imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an alternative. In this study, six machine learning algorithms were used to extract relevant data for predicting the NNI and vegetation index (VI). The results of predicting the NNI of rice using these algorithms showed that the methods of RF performed the best in each growing season, with the best NNI prediction occurring during the filling and early maturity stages. At the early maturity stage, rice NNI was found to be significantly related to both available nitrogen in the soil (AN) and yield. Combining RGB imagery from UAVs with ML algorithms provided a robust and simple solution for instant validation of rice NNI that improved nitrogen use efficiency and provided suggestions for precise fertilization in rice crops despite its limited accuracy. Modern remote sensing methods for precise nutrient management and fertilization could then be divided into two approaches: Deep learning methods for predictions based on multiple remote sensing data or multivariate regressions Wang et al. (2021a). Barbosa et al. (2020a) used five input variables (nitrogen rate, seed rate, elevation map, soil electrical conductivity, and the NDVI index) to estimate corn yield production using a deep-learning approach, and the results were compared with other machine learning approaches (Fully connected neural network (FNN), multiple linear regression (MLR), SVM, and RF regression models). Although a reduction in RMSE of up to 29% was validated compared to the random forest, it should be noted that the deep learning model, satellite data, required a total of 1800 plots to be defined.This study also shows that the most benefit comes from the higher variability of the spatial structure of the data. In their study, Escalante et al. (2019) investigated the recognition performance of a set of classifiers and deep learning convolutional neural networks for evaluating optimal fertilization using RGB images as input. The average LOO cross-validation performance was presented for each of the studied classifiers and each of the pre-trained models. The percentage of correctly identified images is used to quantify the performance. ANN, SVM and Adaboost performed the best with an accuracy of 81.9%, 80.5% and 83.3%, respectively. Considering that only visual features (Barley variety, Fertilizer rate, Vegetation indexes) extracted from RGB images were used, these are promising results (random guessing leads to an accuracy of 33%). This could be due to the fact that sophisticated models are more specific to the target they were created for, while a simple model can be more general and captures relevant information for the representation of images. Yu et al. (2018) used a deep learning-based regression model with a fully connected neural network (FNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to quantify nitrogen concentration in canola leaves. SAE was used to infer deep spectral features in the visible and near-infrared regions from a hyperspectral image of a canola leaf, which in turn were used as input data for the FNN to predict N content. With R 2 = 0.903 , RMSEP = 0.307%, and a residual prediction error RPDp = 3.238 for N concentration, the model SAE-FNN performed quite well. The results show that with a combination of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning, it is possible to quickly and non-destructively detect N concentration in canola leaves to provide better fertilizer recommendations. In another study, Deep Learning was used to detect nitrogen deficiency in corn. For this purpose, four CNN models were pre-trained by applied transfer learning, considering (V4, V6 and R1) as growth stages. The leaf samples were then digitized to generate 384 images representing the 16 nitrogen treatments considered in the study. The results showed significant differences with respect to each growth stage. However, CNNs built using RGB images provided great results (average 61.8%) compared to traditional text-based methods (average 50\u201360%) Montes Condori et al. (2017). Similarly, in the study by Kou et al. (2022), RGB images of the cotton canopy were acquired using a UAV digital camera. The nitrogen content of the cotton canopy was predicted using two cotton cultivars and six nitrogen gradients. Forty-six features were extracted from the image after image preprocessing, and CNN were used to extract deep features. Pearson and partial least squares were used feature selection. For accurate prediction of nitrogen content of cotton crowns, manual features were used as input to build linear regression models, support vector machines, and one-dimensional CNN regression models. Deep learning based features were used as inputs to build a two-dimensional CNN regression model. The results were R 2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 1.67 g kg-1 for Xinluzao 45 and R 2 = 0.42 and RMSE = 3.13 g kg-1 for Xinluzao 53, indicating that cotton nitrogen content can be predicted on a large scale using UAV RGB images and machine learning. However, the accuracy and stability of the prediction model still need to be improved due to insufficient data samples. In addition, soil properties such as total nitrogen can be determined by combining ML algorithms and spectroscopy. These algorithms are an excellent alternative to simple regression models when the goal is to increase the accuracy of the regression. Partial least square regression (PLSR) is a widely used approach for processing multivariable inputs, extracting successive linear combinations of the spectra to achieve the coupled goals of effectively explaining response variation and optimally explaining predictor variation. This is the most commonly used method in soil spectroscopy and chemometrics and has proven successful in assessing water and nitrogen status. The availability of large data sets coupled with better training and the provision of highly accurate models is one of the major challenges for this system when applied to nutritional management. Predictive models have been developed using several technologies, including PLSR, which reduces the number of features required, and neural networks, which compensate for nonlinearity Wang et al. (2021a); Tavakoli and Gebbers (2019); Morellos et al. (2016). Table 1 summarizes and includes brief descriptions of the above studies. 3.3 NPK management based systems The development of NPK management based systems follows two general approaches based the type of input, namely field data (soil tests, fertilization trials, etc.) or RGB and hyperspectral images. Yu et al. (2010) developed a fertilizer model with data points from 10 experimental fields with 4 fertilizer rates and 14 treatments. A neural network ensemble was presented to calculate the fertilizer rate more accurately. The authors used K-means clustering to select the best networks individually and then combined the models using a Lagrange multiplier. A fertilizer model was created using the ensemble method for neural networks described above. In this model, soil nutrient content and fertilizer rate are used as inputs to the neural network, while yield is considered as an output. With this approach, the calculation of fertilizer rates becomes a programming problem and can be used to determine the fertilizer rate with the highest yield and profit and to predict the yield. This fertilizer model was also validated using data on the effect of fertilizers. The results show that using an ensemble of neural networks to predict yield is more accurate than using individual neural networks. According to Cholissodin et al. (2016), the integrated artificial neural network (ANN) can not only optimize fertilizer rates for corn, but also when used in conjunction with Bidirectional Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (BIPSO), the fusion provides better results. The ANN approach provided good results in predicting recommendations using field trial data as training data, while BIPSO optimized multiple features simultaneously, which accelerated the operation of the system. The smallest mean square error (MSE) value was obtained by 10-fold cross-validation, repeating CV hundreds of times. The goal of the study was to initially use ML in pasture and rotational cropping and then extend it to other crops based on the results, which could lead to new insights when used as input by other researchers. Kouadio et al. (2018) investigated the use of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to analyze soil fertility parameters and produce an effective yield estimate. The effectiveness of different ELM-based models based on Soil organic matter (SOM), accessible exchangeable nutrients, and pH was tested with single and multiple combinations of predictor variables. The results of the ELM model were compared with those of existing predictive techniques such as MLR and RF. The authors believe that the ELM model makes a unique contribution to the agricultural sector, particularly in terms of selecting optimal soil parameters for predicting coffee yields. The research demonstrates the potential value of combining machine learning with biophysical crop models. Moreno et al. (2018) found that they could determine the fertilizers and amendments needed for pasture production based on the major nutrients in the soil. They used a multilayer perceptron network trained with the backpropagation algorithm. For fertilizers and additives, a multilayer artificial neural network was trained with an input layer consisting of soil test variables and an output layer with many simultaneous outputs. The MSE of the test data and its standard deviation, and the MSE of the training data and its standard deviation were used to determine the quality of each neural network. The objective of the study was to develop a recommendation system suitable for pasture cropping despite the limited amount of data. Suchithra and Pai (2020) developed a system based on soil test results to classify and predict soil fertility indices and pH values based on various soil characteristics. The algorithm used in this study was an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification and prediction. This algorithm provides better-generalized results by feeding forward NN with a single hidden layer (SLFNs). The potassium fertility index had an accuracy of up to 78%, while the pH classification was up to 89%. The activation function in this NN that had the best classification, accuracy, and kappa values was the GRB function. Similarly, Timsina et al. (2021) also compared three different nutrient management strategies for common cereals considering various factors such as nutrient use efficiency (NUE). A developed site-specific decision support system Nutrient Expert (NE) was used to evaluate the nutrient balance of the field by analyzing past yields or costs. RF algorithm showed that NUE for rice and P and K uptake for wheat and maize were the most important factors contributing to grain yield. Random Forest was used in the study by Yan et al. (2021) to quantify the relative importance of different traits (Phosphorous (P) fertilization practices, region, soil properties, variety, and cropping system) on yield response to P and agronomic efficiency of P in maize. Although this algorithm produced very good results, Maize variety was selected as the most important factor affecting yield. The study encountered several limitations that should be considered in future studies, such as the differences in yield and agronomic efficiency between regions, the different release of fertilizer-P in soil dynamics, and the fact that only top soil samples were used rather than the entire soil profile. Coulibali et al. (2020) investigated and compared machine learning and probabilistic models with site-specific predictive models for fertilization of potato crops in eastern Canada. Using statistical models, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) performance is often associated with fertilizer requirements. Because of the many variables involved, such as soil, land management, genotypes, weather, and pests and diseases, it is difficult to predict appropriate nutrient levels. This study compared different models for evaluating NPK requirements for high quality and yield as a function of soil, land management, and weather. They used data from 273 field trials conducted in Quebec between 1979 and 2017. Predictions from k-nearest neighbors, RF, NN, hierarchical Mitscherlich model, and Gaussian processes were created, tested, and compared. For the prediction of marketable tuber yield, the ML models gave R 2 values of 0.49\u20130.59, which were higher than the R 2 of the Mitscherlich model (0.37). Some models did not agree in obtaining optimal rates from dose-response surfaces under constant conditions. Gaussian processes proved to be a promising method for site-specific fertilizer recommendations that can reduce economic or agronomic risks because of their ability to make suggestions in the context of probabilistic risk assessment. RGB or hyperspectral images can be used to detect nutrient deficiencies at early growth stages non-destructively. In their study, Backhaus et al. (2011) investigated whether supervised approaches for predicting plant nutritional status using classification models are robust enough to handle large data sets with significant variance, such as leaf age or pixel position in the leaf. The learning algorithms tested were SVM, Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization (GRLVQ), Supervised Relevance Neural Gas (SRNG), and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network. Leaf growth stage had the greatest impact on classification accuracy, with SVM and RBF providing reliable results and SRNG and GRLVQ techniques falling to nearly determinable values. The importance of spectral bands in predicting nutrient content was estimated using three cameras covering the visible and shortwave infrared spectrum (VIS /SWIR). The simple separation of pixels of veins and epidermis proved to be a source of confounding variance for nutrient categorization in this work, but had little effect on actual classification performance. Leaf age had a much stronger effect on GRLVQ, SRNG, and SVM classification performance (simple spectra) for nutrient states, such that it was close to the rate. Automatic detection of nutrient deficiencies in leaves of oil palm using a visual system and pattern recognition was presented by Asraf et al. (2012). In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is also used as a classifier using three different kernels: a linear kernel, hard edge polynomial kernel and a soft edge polynomial kernel. According to the preliminary data, the SVM classifiers were able to detect oil palm leaves. The soft-edge polynomial kernel was able to accurately classify nutritional disorders in oil palm leaves with 95% correctness. Support vector feature selection (SVFS), as a variant of SVM, showed great potential in selecting relevant features for nutritional deficiencies. Images of the top three leaves of a rice plant (Oryza sativa L.) and associated leaf sheaths were acquired using static scanning techniques. Thirty-two spectral and shape features were identified from these images by fusion of an RGB mean function and a Matlab region-prop function. NPK deficiencies were effectively detected using hierarchical identification. The overall accuracy of NPK deficiencies for the four growth stages was 86.15, 87.69, 90.00, and 89.23%, respectively. Validation was performed with data from different years, and the accuracies were 83.08, 83.08, 89.23, and 90.77%, respectively Chen et al. (2014). In the study by Ghosal et al. (2018) individual soybean leaves that exhibited a range of deficiency symptoms such as potassium and iron were manually selected and collected in the field by destructive sampling. The leaves and charts were manually recorded with a digital camera. In this way, 25,000 images were collected and labeled to create a dataset of leaf images. The authors used a CNN classifier and were able to achieve an accuracy of 94%. In this study, a deep machine vision based approach was used to detect early symptoms of stress. The presented method is widely applicable in modern agriculture and provides accurate and not time-consuming immediate stress detection. This method has been shown to be relatively insensitive to illumination variations, making it a simple technique for large-scale stress detection. Another deep-learning approach was developed by Culman et al. (2017), who presented PalmHand, a unique smart-device application that allows farmers to detect instant oil palm deficiencies using leaf images. The developed app works as an IoT device that stores and analyzes historical data collected from numerous users simultaneously in the cloud. A single MLP was used to classify oil palms into one of four possible categories. The MLP classified the image into four categories corresponding to a healthy palm or a specimen deficient in potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), or nitrogen (N). The average macroprecision and accuracy were 0.67 and 0.50, respectively. Considering the limited dataset available for training the classifier, these results were considered promising evidence for the concept. However, no information was provided on the circumstances under which the 52 RGB images were acquired. Similarly no details concerning the data were shared in the work of Archana and Saranya (2020) that proposed a method focusing on macronutrients (NPK), soil pH and electrical conductivity, and temperature to provide the best crop recommendations. Crop rotation, fertilizer recommendations, forecasting, and crop production prediction were part of the collaborative proposed system. The objective of this study was to develop a system that combines an agricultural dataset and uses a voting-based ensemble as a classification algorithm to recommend suitable crops. It was found that yield prediction could be of great help to farmers in increasing their yields. Crop rotation has shown good results in improving soil fertility when applied regularly. This technique helps in making fertilizer decisions that are beneficial to farmers. This system had an accuracy of 92%. Although machine learning is widely used in agriculture in general and in nutrient management and fertilizer recommendations in particular, the literature shows that research needs to focus on the availability of data, including all the important factors that need to be used to overcome the limitations Ransom et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2021b); Yu et al. (2010); Cholissodin et al. (2016). Table 2 summarizes the above work for the case of nutrient management subcategory. 4 Summary and outlook The development of a nutrient management tool using machine learning generated a great deal of interest in the scientific community, which recognized the importance of food security and the sustainability of its processes Thompson et al. (2015). With the revolution that our modern agriculture is experiencing today, the use of various sensors, smart irrigation systems, and remote sensing, more and more datasets are becoming available Chlingaryan et al. (2018). These large datasets have emerged simultaneously with major advances in computer science such as machine learning, which has led to incredible breakthroughs in this research area. In this paper, we collected and reviewed various machine learning approaches in the field of nutrient management. Analysis of these articles revealed that in the nitrogen management category, Random Forests was the most frequently used ML algorithm. The popularity of RFs correlated with better results ( R 2 was up to 0.97 Qiu et al. (2021)). In the NPK category, many models such as SVMs were used, but an RF-based algorithm gave the best R 2 score Timsina et al. (2021). In the Nitrogen category, we can see a high presence of image inputs, reflecting the emerging trend and the wide use of multi-source images (HS, RGB, NIR, etc.). This has been enabled by the development and affordability of this technology along with high computational power. By integrating machine learning with IoT data, farm management systems are evolving into true artificial intelligence systems that provide better recommendations and insights for future decisions and actions, with the goal of increasing productivity. To this end, it is envisioned that the use of machine learning models will become even more popular over time, enabling the development of integrated and applicable technologies. Despite the great strides that have been made recently in the field of nutrient management, actual practical/accurate application is currently a challenge. Many limitations have come to light that are related to the methods used and are both intrinsically and extrinsically related to the target problem. The current state of nutrient management using digital imagery and machine learning was also discussed to provide an in-depth analysis of the various challenges faced by many researchers working on this topic. Collecting datasets with such precise factors and for a specific crop is usually not an easy task, considering that not all available datasets are representative enough of the variation found in the field. To determine suitability for practical application, basic data from studies of crop response to nutrients in fields with cross-validation are needed. Soil properties John et al. (2020), plant density, weather indices, plant variety, plant growth stage and N, P, and K fertilizer rates, are all very important and should be considered in data collection because they can directly affect the model output Trontelj ml and Chambers (2021). Yield response can vary by plant variety in addition to the fertilizer rate proposed by recommendation systems. In addition, field trials would directly impact yield and improve not only biomass, but also solution sustainability and soil health. This practice would shed light on forgotten features such as SOM and tillage systems, leading to a better understanding of soil dynamics and better recommendations. For example, Ransom et al. (2019) and Qin et al. (2018) tested several models and algorithms to improve nitrogen requirement for corn. In the case of Ransom et al. (2019), the R 2 was up to 0.94, with data sets collected from 49 experimental sites in the Midwestern United States. While R 2 in Qin et al. (2018) was only 0.46, using data from a limited number of sites. Both studies tested the effect of ML algorithms on nutrient management but reached different conclusions due to the quality and size of the data they used. The most critical point to mention is that many people see machine learning as a solution to future needs in agriculture. On the other hand, machine learning only provides the best recommendations based on the inputs. In practice, various soil parameters need to be considered to achieve greater or higher yields and better environmental performance than traditional fertilizer management systems. However, to fully understand this system, a standardized research technique based on site-specific parameters is required. We believe that a comprehensive knowledge of what accuracy means is insufficient. As a result, different technologies, procedures, and criteria for accuracy and good results have been used, leading to a scenario of conflicting results. We also find that all approaches look at single procedures and solutions and are not sufficiently linked to the decision process as is the case in other application areas. The real problem is understanding the right path to the best nutrient management recommendations and making them accessible and understandable to farmers. Researchers should also focus on the transition between great modeling results and tangible practices to achieve them. From most of the articles reviewed, we can conclude that there were strong correlations between model accuracy and dataset size and quality. Compiling comprehensive data sets that account for all the different scenarios and variabilities is the most difficult task Barbedo (2019), but is considered key to accurate results. The first step would be to identify the data source, which could include field studies and research. Second, we need to collect data on soil type and climate from research studies and APIs. We also need data on crop type, crop yield, and management data that can be obtained from farmers, extension services, and government agencies. Finally, the collected data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This includes removing outliers and normalizing the data to combine them into a single data set that can be used by the ML algorithm. However, we believe that data availability is the bottleneck when it comes to taking full advantage of what ML can offer to the field of fertilizer recommendations. We encourage researchers to share their data with the community to enhance the capabilities and impact of the research. We also encourage researchers developing ML-based recommendation systems to suggest the best suitable features and develop other features that can be collected at a large scale. In addition, it is crucial to standardize the methodological approach to nutrient management systems based on a detailed description of the entire system so that results from different experiments and parts of the world can be logically compared. The accessibility of powerful machine learning tools and techniques on many open source platforms is certainly beneficial to the research community. However, this also leads to many misleading publications by researchers who either do not know exactly what ML expertise is required or do not have the proper soil and plant nutrient knowledge. This phenomenon has led to a great pipe dream Schut and Giller (2020); Lischeid et al. (2022); Paudel et al. (2021) in which scientists confirm the accuracy of their models while considering the wrong parameters. Given the rapid progress ML has made in recent decades, it is very likely that the world will see an increase in the applications of ML models. The integration and applications are becoming more and more remarkable. ML algorithms show great potential when properly used for support or decision-making. The fusion of spectral and spatial features and unique hybrid processing systems that complement each other's limitations would definitely improve the understanding of soil dynamics. This success will likely be paired with better yields leading to a more food-secure world. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Technoparkstrasse 1 Zurich 8005 Switzerland This paper proposes an industrial-friendly approach based on physics-informed Bayesian machine learning for probabilistic inference and refinement of stability predictions in milling. The knowledge from physics principles and theoretical models is gathered into a substructure-based framework and enables dedicated updating and exchange of models on a substructure level. The Bayesian learning algorithm utilizes this framework as a basis to simultaneously interact with multiple machine and process configurations that share substructures, leading to federated and transfer learning over a network of machine tools on a production site. Moreover, the paper further elaborates on the Bayesian perspective to anticipate the potential usefulness of given experimental data in improving the model accuracy by quantifying information gain for two primary purposes: Firstly, recursive online learning can manage computational resources by processing only the most informative data points that may be collected during arbitrary cuts. Secondly, active learning leverages the information gain to dynamically adapt a sequential data collection, leading to accelerated learning with minimal labeled data. The experimental validations confirm that the proposed approaches lead to effective learning and reliable predictions of milling stability, outperforming traditional deterministic methods. Keywords Chatter stability Physics-informed Bayesian learning Active learning Transfer learning Federated learning Recursive online learning Introduction Despite self-excited chatter vibrations having been the subject of extensive research by scholars for many years, it continues to be one of the main factors limiting the productivity of milling operations in industrial environments. While predicting chatter allows recognizing chatter-free process conditions for a boost in production rate, their blind selection can be followed by undesirable consequences such as poor surface quality, accelerated tool wear, and even machine failure. Stability Lobe Diagrams (SLDs) are a recognized tool to distinguish between stable and unstable cutting depths as a function of spindle speed. Nevertheless, there is often a notable difference between the theoretical and experimental limits of stability presenting a significant barrier to practical application in industry. Although theoretical models of milling dynamics are not exact replications of the actual machining process, the primary reason for this discrepancy is attributed to the input parameters used in these models, which may be imprecise or altered during operation. The literature extensively discussed the modeling of milling dynamics, which involves understanding the interaction between the milling tool and the workpiece. This interaction is governed by a time delay between the current vibrations of the cutting edge and the vibration marks left on the workpiece by the previous cutting edge being the excitation of vibrations. This time-delayed feedback in the milling process generates a closed-loop self-exciting effect, which can cause process instability under specific conditions. Since the first study on this topic by Tlusty and Polacek [1] in 1963, various methods have been introduced in the time and frequency domains to analyze the regenerative effect and process stability. These approaches have been widely studied by pioneers and can be found in their highlighted academic publications, such as Altintas et al. [2], Insperger and St\u00e9p\u00e1n [3], Bachrathy et al. [4], and the well-known Zero-order Approximation (ZOA) method by Altintas and Budak [5]. Besides information about the engagement conditions and tool geometry, the most critical inputs required for stability predictions using these theoretical models are the cutting forces and the dynamic response of the machine tool structure at the tip of the cutting tool [6,7]. The two inputs can be acquired through either modeling or experimental characterization. Nonetheless, exclusively relying on theoretical models is usually unfeasible since it can result in substantial inaccuracies in predictions. In contrast, experimental characterization can be costly and time-consuming, requiring specialized measurement equipment and skilled operator expertise. The following presents a concise overview of these approaches. The metal cutting forces can be characterized through two fundamentally distinct methods: numerical analysis and experimental characterization. Researchers have studied numerical approaches such as the mesh-free method through an updated Lagrangian approach with dynamic refinement by Afrasiabi et al. [8,9] or finite element analysis by Gonzalo et al. [10]. However, these methods are computationally demanding, and uncertainties in the material properties of the workpiece can lead to inaccurate force predictions. Hence, the experimental approaches have received attention in the modeling of cutting forces by introducing multiple coefficients, known as Cutting Force Coefficients (CFCs). These coefficients relate the uncut chip thickness to the resulting forces and assume different dependencies such as linear [7,11], cubic [12], and exponential [13]. In this regard, the main analytical formulations are orthogonal to oblique transformation [14], mechanistic identification [7], and nonlinear optimization [15,16]. While the mechanistic calibration is relatively straightforward, the coefficients can have dependencies on process parameters such as spindle speed and feed rate [17,18]. The experimental approaches of identifying CFCs require the measurement of instantaneous or average cutting forces. While table or rotary dynamometers are commonly used in academic research (e.g [19\u201322]), they are impractical for industrial applications due to their high cost and the restrictions they impose on the workpiece or tool mounting, as well as imposing undesirable structural compliance. Consequently, researchers have explored indirect estimation techniques that integrate additional sensors or use NC controller signals. The fundamental concept of these methods is to measure accessible signals that are correlated with the cutting forces and then use a transformation to recover the cutting forces from the noisy distorted measurements. For example, Postel et al. [23] used accelerometers mounted on the spindle housing, Ostad Ali Akbari et al. [24] used a non-contact displacement sensor at the spindle\u2019s rotating part, and Aslan and Altintas [25] used drive current measurements in a 5-axis milling machine. In these studies, Kalman filters were employed to compensate for the distortion of frequency content between the cutting zone and the sensor measurements. Although indirect approaches appear to be a cost-efficient alternative for force monitoring, the biggest challenge remains the accurate compensation of the distorted frequency response of the measured signal which is associated with the vibrational modes of the machine system and may require comprehensive mathematical modeling and calibration. Obtaining the machine tool\u2019s structural dynamics at its tooltip also raises certain challenges. While direct measurement of tooltip dynamics through conventional impact testing may appear to be the most straightforward method for its ease of usage and short setup time, the strong dependence of the tooltip dynamics on the tool-holder combination necessitates repeating the impact test for every tool-holder-spindle combination. This approach is impractical for the countless number of combinations that may exist on a shop floor. On the other hand, theoretical modeling of the entire machine tool encounters sophisticated complexities and requires detailed knowledge of the machine components\u2019 geometry and dedicated experimental calibrations for joint and damping characterization [26\u201328]. To alleviate these challenges, Receptance Coupling Substructure Analysis (RCSA) by Schmitz and Donalson [29] offered a viable alternative by facilitating the coupling of experimentally measured machine tool dynamics (excluding the tooling system) to theoretically modeled tool-holder assembly. Theoretical modeling of the tool-holder assembly typically involves segmented Timoshenko beams representing the tool and holder, connected through a damped-flexible joint at their interface. The stiffness and damping values of this joint are commonly tuned based on experimental measurements. Matthias et al. [30] used a Timoshenko beam model with a lumped joint interface and used the receptance of the tool-holder assembly, measured by an impulse hammer and laser vibrometer in free-free boundary conditions, to tune the lumped contact parameters. Alternatively, Ostad Ali Akbari et al. [31] introduced a finite-element-based implementation of the Timoshenko beam with a non-uniformly distributed elastic-damped connection along the tool-holder clamping length. The associated contact parameters are estimated through a nonlinear evolutionary optimization to maximize the correlation of the assembly\u2019s bending dynamics to the dominant peaks that appeared in the emitted sound spectrum when an arbitrary object impacts the tool-holder assembly in free-free boundary conditions. Further attempts in the modeling of the tool-holder dynamics can be found in [29,32\u201335\u201338,39,40]. As both experiment-based and model-based approaches require extensive preparation and analysis, in recent years, researchers have explored the use of machine learning techniques in the prediction of stability charts. Some researchers have taken a purely data-driven approach, such as Cherukuri et al. [41], who trained a multi-layer neural network classifier on at least 600 samples to achieve acceptable stability classification accuracy. Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven to be powerful tools for complex classification tasks, their effectiveness heavily relies on having a large and diverse training dataset that covers all possible machine tool and process configurations. However, obtaining such a rich dataset from chatter records during experimental cuts is often infeasible for industries. Researchers have utilized physical models to generate supplementary data to feed DNNs. For example, Postel et al. [6] proposed an ensemble deep transfer learning method in which they pre-trained 200 DNNs on different simulated data sets. Each of these data sets was generated considering various combinations of model parameters based on their uncertainty distributions. A fine-tuning step was conducted ultimately on each DNN with an experimental dataset. Through this transfer learning technique, approximately 103 \u2212 104 number of the required data for pre-training were generated from simulations, while 101 \u2212 102 of data points in the fine-tuning step were obtained from experimental cuts. However, it should be noted that for each tool-holder-spindle combination and workpiece material, a dedicated ensemble set of DNNs must be prepared, thus presenting a limitation of this approach. The use of hybrid techniques that incorporate physical models directly into machine-learning frameworks has gained popularity in recent years. Postel et al. [18] proposed a novel stability prediction method based on a neural network-supported inverse identification technique, which utilizes multiple neural networks to generate input parameters for stability calculation via ZOA. The neural network weights were tuned using a genetic algorithm, which minimized a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted and observed stability limit and chatter frequency. While this inverse method successfully improved stability predictions and revealed important dependencies, such as the relationship between CFCs and spindle speed, its black-box nature limits the transferability of the gained knowledge to similar configurations. Wegener et al. [42] addressed this shortcoming by introducing a substructure-based stability prediction framework augmented with neural networks to account for unknown dependencies. The framework was trained in a similar manner to the previously mentioned work, by minimizing the discrepancies between the predicted and observed stability limits and chatter frequency. The major drawback of this updating approach is that it does not offer any information to enhance the models when both the predictions by the model and observations are stable. Although hybrid methods have proven to be a promising strategy for leveraging physical models and saving experimental data points in stability prediction refinement, these methods are based on a deterministic perspective and do not account for model uncertainties. Subsequently, the accuracy of their predictions depends on the richness of the experimental dataset in containing learnable information, which is not known beforehand. In contrast, a Bayesian perspective provides a framework for quantifying the degree of confidence in the prediction by considering the full range of possible model parameters and their respective probabilities. Karandikar et al. [43] presented a Bayesian approach that is purely data-driven for generating a probabilistic stability map from experimental chatter observations without prior knowledge of tool dynamics or CFCs. However, similar to other pure data-driven approaches, the knowledge acquired is specific to the machine and process configuration and is further limited here to the engagement condition. In [44], the same authors extended their approach to developing a closed-loop scheme for identifying optimal process parameters automatically based on a criterion on the expected improvement of material removal rate. Cornelius et al. [45] developed a physics-based stability prediction model that accounts for the uncertainty distributions associated with input parameters. These distributions are propagated through the model to create stability maps. The authors used a sampling approach to estimate posterior distributions, collecting 1000 samples with a greedy adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, introduced by Haario et al. [46]. They then employed the posterior probability map to select the process parameters that maximize the expected increase in material removal rate, following the approach proposed by Karandikar et al. [47]. Ahmadi [48] applied Bayesian techniques to update the posterior distributions of modal parameters in turning operations by analyzing the closed-loop poles of the system based on in-process vibration measurements during stable cuts. The author collected a large set of 25000 samples using an improved Transitional MCMC algorithm from Betz et al. [49]. Li et al. [50] also modeled the bending dynamics at the tooltip by a 2DOF system whose modal parameters are obtained by fitting modes to an experimental measurement of the tooltip receptance in idle conditions. This procedure was repeated multiple times to establish a prior distribution for the modal parameter values. The objective was to refine these distributions to account for the variations of machine tool dynamics under operational conditions. They utilized an improved ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo method (IGWMCMC) that employs an ensemble of multiple walkers to enhance the convergence of the Markov Chain to the posterior distribution. Although the Bayesian model updating techniques described in the literature employ physical principles, the physics-based models they rely on have been simplified, focusing only on CFCs and the modal parameters of single-mode structural dynamics. This approach neglects the contribution of machine tool substructures, such as tool and holder, to the combined structural response at the cutting zone. Schmitz et al.[51] enhanced the physics-based model by coupling spindle-holder-tool structures via a lumped flexible-damped joint. However, consideration of a lumped joint considers an oversimplified assumption of the contact interface, and the interface parameters can vary by tool diameter, and clamping length, according to Matthias et al.[30]. Consequently, this limitation hinders the transferability of identified contact parameters between similar holder interfaces. As a result, it is not possible to effectively transfer parameter values between different machines with similar components at a substructure level. This paper further develops the concept of physics-based Bayesian machine learning for probabilistic refinement and inference of milling stability and offers the following primary contributions: . \u2022 The modular implementation of physical models facilitates the updating and exchange of knowledge at a substructure level. By incorporating a more realistic distributed holder-tool interface, the interface parameters are decoupled from the clamping length and tool diameter. This independence allows for establishing an information flow, e.g. between similar holders mounted on different machines, thereby enabling federated and transfer learning across a network of machine tools on a shop floor. \u2022 Predicting the informativeness allows quantification of the effectiveness of a specific process configuration in reducing model uncertainties and enables optimal allocation of computational resources in recursive online learning. Additionally, leveraging informativeness in Bayesian experimental design allows for the strategic selection of experiments that accelerate the learning process while minimizing the need for extensive training data. \u2022 The employed Evolutionary MCMC combined with simulated annealing uses multiple parallel chains, enhancing sample diversity by exploring various regions that may be inaccessible within a reasonable time frame for a single chain. This approach facilitates the implementation of interaction operators, such as crossover, that exchange information from different chains to improve the subsequent generation of samples, offering benefits such as faster convergence, exploration-exploitation trade-off, and robustness to initialization [52,53]. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the substructure-based framework of physics-based models that are involved in structural dynamics and stability analysis. Section 3 is devoted to the fundamentals of supervised, recursive, and active Bayesian learning. Section 4 presents various implementations of Bayesian learning in milling stability and evaluation of their effectiveness using experimental cutting tests. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5. Physics-based stability prediction In this study, the theoretical modeling framework divides the milling machine into smaller substructures, with each representing a specific component, as is demonstrated in Fig. 1. This approach is highly advantageous for dealing with the numerous combinations of machine and process configurations commonly found in manufacturing sites. To determine the necessary inputs for predicting stability limits and chatter frequency using ZOA, a machine and process configuration vector x needs to contain the following specifications: . \u2022 Machine tool and spindle: to specify the machine tool dynamics that are experimentally measured at the spindle flange. \u2022 Holder-tool combination and stick-out length: to specify the required dimensions and material properties to create finite-element models of holder and tool and couple them according to the stick-out length. \u2022 Workpiece material: to initiate tangential K tc and radial K rc CFCs for each workpiece material-tool pair and can be assumed to be fairly similar for tools that share comparable characteristics such as cutting edge geometry, coating, and wear state. \u2022 Engagement angles: start \u03d5 st and exit \u03d5 ex angles to calculate the average value of directional dynamic milling force coefficients for ZOA solution [5,7] and can be precisely obtained by a geometrical simulation of the material removal, e.g. using commercial software such as MACHpro [54]. \u2022 Process parameters: spindle speed \u03a9, axial depth of cut a p , and feed direction angle \u03c8. As previously highlighted, obtaining tooltip dynamics is typically achieved by substructure coupling through RCSA. Fig. 2 illustrates the substructure coupling scheme for a generic machine-holder-tool structure. The dynamics at the machine tool side \u2014 including the machine tool body, spindle shaft, and HSK-A63 blank \u2014 are measured once experimentally at point 3 in Fig. 2 through the inverse RCSA approach presented by Namazi et al.[55]. The resulting dynamics is represented by the Frequency Response Function (FRF) matrix of H S,33 and contains the following entities: (1) H S , 33 = h S , 33 , t F h S , 33 , t M h S , 33 , r F h S , 33 , r M with h S,33, tF standing for the scalar complex-valued frequency-dependent receptance for translational force input at point 3 of substructure S and translational response at the same point. Analogously, other entities relate translational and rotational displacements (subscript t and r) to force and moment inputs (subscript F and M). Note that throughout this article, non-scalar values appear in a bold typeface. The machine tool FRFs are assumed to have uncoupled dynamics in X and Y directions. The same substructure coupling formulations hold for an extended FRF matrix that contains axes cross-coupling. As mentioned earlier, the use of beam models to obtain the dynamics of tool-holder assemblies is suitable due to their simple cylindrical geometry and necessary due to the frequent variation of their combinations. The required direct and cross FRFs between points 1 and 2 of the tooling system substructure T are obtained following a finite-element-based implementation of Timoshenko beam models with a distributed damped-flexible interface, as proposed by Ostad Ali Akbari et al. [31]. This method involves a multi-point coupling of the individual holder and tool in the spatial domain through the following matrix of flexible-damped contact at each coupling point: (2) k \u02dc h t ( e ) = L c N c k t t ( 1 + j \u03b7 t t ) 0 0 k r r ( 1 + j \u03b7 r r ) with k tt and k rr standing for translational and rotational stiffness per unit length and \u03b7 tt and \u03b7 rr for translational and rotational displacement-dependent damping, respectively. This damped-elastic contact is distributed across the clamping length L c between N c clamping nodes. The significance of slope is disregarded due to its relevance in affecting the accuracy of higher-order bending modes, which are typically not associated with regenerative chatter. Finally, the FRFs of the machine tool and the tooling system are rigidly coupled by ensuring that their translational and rotational displacements are equal, i.e., X S,3 = X T,2, and their force and moment interactions are in equilibrium, i.e., F S,3 + F T,2 = 0 . The tooltip dynamics of the coupled structure ST can be obtained using the following RCSA formulation: (3) H S T , 11 = H T , 11 \u2212 H T , 12 ( H S , 33 + H T , 22 ) \u2212 1 H T , 21 For stability prediction, only the translational displacement to force FRFs at the tooltip is required. If the feed direction is in the XY plane of the machine\u2019s coordinate system and has an inclination angle of \u03c8 with respect to the X direction, the FRFs should be projected to the feed and the normal directions, denoted as FN coordinate system. The projection can be achieved through the following mapping: (4) h S T , 11 , t F F F h S T , 11 , t F F N h S T , 11 , t F N F h S T , 11 , t F N N = cos \u03c8 sin \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03c8 cos \u03c8 h S T , 11 , t F X X h S T , 11 , t F X Y h S T , 11 , t F Y X h S T , 11 , t F Y Y cos \u03c8 \u2212 sin \u03c8 sin \u03c8 cos \u03c8 In the end, the projected tooltip dynamics together with CFCs and other inputs are used to calculate the critical depth of cut a cr , model and chatter frequency f c, model using ZOA for the machine and process specified by x . To summarize, Table 1 outlines the uncertain model parameters associated with each machine and process configuration x . The utilization of logarithmic mappings facilitates the exploration of the parameter space and ensures parameters are transformed to comparable scales. The determination of the prior distribution of holder parameters considers feasible values estimated from sound analysis in [31]. Such wide prior distributions account for various interface types. Similarly, the prior distribution for CFCs is introduced to incorporate a comprehensive range of values for different tool-workpiece combinations. The vector \u03b8 contains a unique set of these uncertain model parameters for all process configurations x 1:n = { x 1, x 2, \u2026, x n } involved in a learning cycle. On the other hand, the chatter detection system monitors the cutting process at each machine and process configuration x and provides the corresponding monitoring vector y containing: . \u2022 Stability state of the process (s): assumes a binary value with 1 and 0 representing experimental unstable and stable states, respectively. \u2022 Experimental chatter frequency (f c ): only available in case of unstable process. Probabilistic learning and inference Bayesian statistics employs probability distributions to quantify the level of uncertainty associated with the potential outcomes of a random variable. The uncertainty of the model, also known as epistemic uncertainty, arises due to the insufficient amount or quality of training data for improving the model accuracy. This concept is particularly important in the refinement of stability predictions, where the availability of experimental data is often limited. This section introduces Bayesian learning for updating model parameters based on experimental observations with a tailored likelihood function for milling stability. This allows for probabilistic inference to determine the probability of process stability. Also, active learning is introduced for optimal data collection and a faster reduction in model uncertainty. Bayesian learning In Bayesian learning, the goal is to update a prior distribution of parameters P( \u03b8 ) to an updated distribution called the posterior P( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1:n , x 1:n ) given the observation likelihood P( y 1:n \u2223 x 1:n ; \u03b8 ) using the Bayes rule: (5) P ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) = 1 Z P ( y 1 : n \u2223 x 1 : n ; \u03b8 ) P ( \u03b8 ) and Z represents a scalar value to normalize the summation of probabilities and is the marginal probability of data under all possible model parameters: (6) Z = \u222b P ( y 1 : n \u2223 x 1 : n ; \u03b8 ) P ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 The computation of Z involves computing high-dimensional integrals over the parameter domain and is intractable. As the computation of the posterior probability is possible up to this normalizing factor, the unnormalized version of the posterior probability is usually sufficient: (7) q ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) = P ( y 1 : n \u2223 x 1 : n ; \u03b8 ) P ( \u03b8 ) Recursive Bayesian learning The recursive Bayesian model updating approach is particularly well-suited for online applications that involve sequential observations and require refinement of the model parameters with each new observation. The equation (8) P ( n + 1 ) ( \u03b8 ) = 1 Z P ( y n + 1 \u2223 x n + 1 ; \u03b8 ) P ( n ) ( \u03b8 ) represents the recursive implementation of Bayesian model updating with P (n)( \u03b8 ) being the posterior distribution after the first n observations, i.e. P (n)( \u03b8 ) = P( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1:n , x 1:n ). As the equation explains, the posterior after n observations becomes the prior for the next updating iteration when (n + 1)th data arrives. Likelihood function for stability refinement The likelihood function is defined as the probability of random variable realizations conditional on particular values of the model parameters. Therefore, the likelihood of a given sample indicates which parameter values are more likely than others, in terms of making the observed data more probable. The total likelihood of n observations, given a single sample of the model parameter vector \u03b8 j , is (9) P ( y 1 : n \u2223 x 1 : n ; \u03b8 j ) = \u220f i = 1 n s i P s ( s i = 1 \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) P f ( f c , i \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) + ( 1 \u2212 s i ) P s ( s i = 0 \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) It is worth noting that the first term in the likelihood function accounts for unstable observations and considers both the stability state and chatter frequency, whereas the second term only incorporates the stability state for stable observations. The likelihood of observing a particular stability state s i at configuration x i is computed based on comparing its depth of cut a p ( x i ) to the model-predicted critical depth of cut a cr , model ( x i ; \u03b8 j ) for a given sample of model parameters \u03b8 j . This likelihood is established using a logistic (sigmoid) function defined as follows: (10) P s ( s i = 1 \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) = 1 \u2215 1 + exp a c r , m o d e l ( x i ; \u03b8 j ) \u2212 a p ( x i ) k and k adjusts the steepness of the state transition at stability borders. Since P s (s i \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) has a Bernoulli distribution, therefore: (11) P s ( s i = 0 \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) = 1 \u2212 P s ( s i = 1 \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) Moreover, the additional likelihood for unstable observations is defined by considering the experimental chatter frequency f c,i in relation to the corresponding model-predicted chatter frequency f c, model ( x i ; \u03b8 j ) for the given x i and \u03b8 j . This likelihood is established using a normal Gaussian distribution as follows: (12) P f ( f c , i \u2223 x i ; \u03b8 j ) = 1 \u03c3 f 2 \u03c0 exp \u2212 ( f c , i \u2212 f c , m o d e l ( x i ; \u03b8 j ) ) 2 2 \u03c3 f 2 and \u03c3 f accounts for possible uncertainties in the precision of the chatter detection system. Evolutionary Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EMCMC) MCMC is widely used for sampling from complex posterior distributions that are difficult to evaluate analytically. The primary goal of MCMC is to produce a sequence of samples that follow a Markov chain, where each state in the chain depends only on the preceding state. The efficiency and convergence rate of the chain is influenced by various factors, including the proposal distribution and the initial state of the chain. Various techniques have been developed to enhance the efficiency of MCMC. For instance, the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics method leverages stochastic gradient information to steer the chain towards regions of high probability for the target posterior distribution [56]. Evolutionary algorithms are an effective means of discovering globally optimal regions in a search space. Their primary advantage is that they do not require gradient computation, which can be advantageous in non-differentiable non-convex problems, e.g. in physics-based stability prediction in milling. Evolutionary algorithms operate on a combination of crossover, which allows different populations to share information, and mutation, which enables the algorithm to explore the search space more thoroughly to discover the globally optimal region. The publication by Katoch et al. [57] provides a comprehensive review over evolutionary operators and their implementations. EMCMC combines the idea from evolutionary algorithms with MCMC and uses evolutionary operators, crossover and mutation, to guide the exploration of the parameter space to collect samples from regions with high posterior probability. Let { \u0398 n g e n } with n gen = 1, 2, \u2026, N gen represent generations of populations with each population containing multiple individuals as \u0398 n g e n = { \u03b8 n g e n , n p o p } for n pop = 1, 2, \u2026, N pop . The fitness function of a parameter vector \u03b8 j is defined as the negative of the log-posterior from Eq. (7) as: (13) F ( \u03b8 j ) = \u2212 log q ( \u03b8 j \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) The evolutionary operators of crossover and mutation produce new offspring, which are represented as { \u03b8 \u02dc n g e n , n p o p } . To determine which individuals will be selected for the next generation, a survival strategy must be defined. The survival strategy employed in evolutionary algorithms can vary across implementations; for example, single-objective genetic optimization often utilizes fitness sorting, while non-dominated sorting is used in multi-objective optimization in NSGA-II [58]. When using evolutionary algorithms for sampling purposes, it is necessary to employ a different survival strategy to ensure an appropriate distribution for a Monte Carlo approximation. Drugan and Thierens [59] provided a review over various implementations of EMCMC. Inspired by Marwala et al. [60] proposing an implementation of the EMCMC combined with simulated annealing technique, the survival is defined based on the Metropolis criterion [61,62] as (14) r n g e n , n p o p = exp F ( \u03b8 n g e n , n p o p ) \u2212 F ( \u03b8 \u02dc n g e n , n p o p ) T n g e n where an offspring is selected with a probability of min ( 1 , r n g e n , n p o p ) . T n g e n denotes the annealing temperature, which decreases as n gen increases. A higher temperature in early generations allows greater exploration of the search space, whereas a cooler temperature in later generations emphasizes more on sampling around regions of high posterior probability that have already been discovered. The cooling schedule is defined as follows: (15) T n g e n = ( T max \u2212 1 ) 1 \u2212 n g e n N g e n \u03b3 + 1 that suggests a polynomial decay of the annealing temperature from T max for the first to 1 for the last generation. The hyperparameter \u03b3 adjusts the cooling rate. To implement the algorithm for this study, Pymoo [63] library is employed. Probabilistic inference The probability distributions are approximated using the samples drawn from the posterior distribution by EMCMC, i.e. \u03b8 j \u223c P( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1:n , x 1:n ). To perform Monte Carlo approximations, the first portion of samples is discarded according to a burn-in number N burn-in during which the distribution of the EMCMC does not yet approximate the posterior distribution well, while the remaining m samples are retained. The probabilistic stability map, which determines the posterior probability of the stability state at each configuration, is obtained through the following Monte Carlo approximation: (16) P ( s * \u2223 x * , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) = \u222b P s ( s * \u2223 x * , \u03b8 ) P ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) d \u03b8 = E \u03b8 \u223c p \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n [ P s ( s * \u2223 x * , \u03b8 ) ] \u2248 1 m \u2211 j = 1 m P s ( s * \u2223 x * , \u03b8 j ) with E \u03b8 \u223c p \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n [ P s ( s * \u2223 x * , \u03b8 ) ] representing the expectation of P s (s * \u2223 x *, \u03b8 ) when \u03b8 is drawn according to its posterior distribution, \u03b8 \u223c p\u2223 y 1:n , x 1:n to be short. The notations \u2022* represent an evaluating process configuration whose stability state is of interest. The process conditions over a grid of spindle speed and depth of cut can be considered to create a full probabilistic map of the stability states. Similarly, a probabilistic map for chatter frequency can be created: (17) P ( f c * \u2223 x * , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) = \u222b P f ( f c * \u2223 x * , \u03b8 ) P ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) d \u03b8 = E \u03b8 \u223c p \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n [ P f ( f c * \u2223 x * , \u03b8 ) ] \u2248 1 m \u2211 j = 1 m P f ( f c * \u2223 x * , \u03b8 j ) Ultimately, the posterior distribution of model parameters is estimated by a family of independent Gaussian distributions, i.e. multivariate normal distributions with zero off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix, by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the collected parameter samples \u03b8 j . Active learning In supervised learning, the model relies on passively collected training data to learn or refine the underlying model. However, the quality of the resulting model is influenced by the quantity and relevance of the information contained within the training dataset. The passively collected data may not always include the most valuable information for model improvement, as it is gathered without considering its potential impact or informativeness. Active learning [64], in contrast, adopts a more proactive approach where the model actively seeks the most informative data for the next training iteration. This approach is motivated by the need to optimize resources spent on data collection and processing, and to reduce the model\u2019s epistemic uncertainty in the most efficient and quickest manner. Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) [65,66] suggests a sequential decision process to select the next data collection at a point where the information gain is maximized for model parameters in a classification task. The acquisition function of the active learning is customized for the experimental data collection in the refinement of milling stability prediction as: (18) x n + 1 = argmin x a p ( x ) S u b j e c t t o : I ( \u03b8 ; s \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) \u2212 \u03bb max x \u2032 I ( \u03b8 ; s \u2032 \u2223 x \u2032 , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) \u2265 0 with I representing the information gain as will be defined in the following. This acquisition function aims to recommend the next experimental point with the consideration of the minimum axial depth of cut a p ( x ) while having at least \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1] proportion of the maximum attainable information gain. This manner encourages the algorithm to prioritize conservative recommendations that are more likely to be stable or unstable points with low depth of cut, in order to alleviate the potential negative consequences of chatter. The symmetry of the information gain implies that I ( \u03b8 ; s \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) = I ( s ; \u03b8 \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) which facilitates the computations. The information gain or informativeness is then defined as: (19) I ( s ; \u03b8 \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) = H s \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n \u2212 E \u03b8 \u223c P ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) H s \u2223 x , \u03b8 The notation H refers to the entropy of a random variable and provides a measure of its associated uncertainty. Information gain is a measure of the anticipated reduction in entropy after some particular observation will be acquired. The first term in Eq. (19) represents the overall marginal entropy, whereas the second term corresponds to the expected conditional entropy. The calculation of the total marginal entropy is given by: (20) H [ s \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ] = \u2212 \u2211 c \u2208 { 0 , 1 } P ( s = c \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) log 2 P ( s = c \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) which requires the calculations of marginal probabilities using the following equation and the corresponding Monte Carlo estimation: (21) P ( s = c \u2223 x , y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) = \u222b P ( s = c \u2223 x , \u03b8 ) P ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) d \u03b8 \u2248 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m P ( s = c \u2223 x , \u03b8 j ) On the other hand, the estimated value of the conditional entropy is obtained from the following equation and then approximated using a Monte Carlo approximation: (22) E \u03b8 \u223c P ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) [ H [ s \u2223 x , \u03b8 ] ] = \u2212 E \u03b8 \u223c P ( \u03b8 \u2223 y 1 : n , x 1 : n ) [ \u2211 c \u2208 { 0 , 1 } P ( s = c \u2223 x , \u03b8 ) log 2 P ( s = c \u2223 x , \u03b8 ) ] \u2248 \u2212 1 m \u2211 i = 1 m \u2211 c \u2208 { 0 , 1 } P ( s = c \u2223 x , \u03b8 j ) log 2 P ( s = c \u2223 x , \u03b8 j ) Further details can be found in [65,67]. Implementations and validations This section is devoted to introducing and validating various implementations of the model-supported Bayesian framework. The algorithm implementation can be summarized in the following steps: 1. Detect similarities and shared substructures among the process configurations of interest x 1:n . For example, if multiple tool-holder combinations involve the same holder, a single set of holder parameters will be initiated and shared across them. Analogously, if the same tool-workpiece material is found in multiple operations, CFCs are shared between them, i.e. \u03b8 = [ p 1 h o l d e r 1 , p 2 h o l d e r 1 , p 3 h o l d e r 1 , \u2026 , p 4 t o o l \u2212 w p 1 , p 5 t o o l \u2212 w p 1 , \u2026 ] . 2. Initialize the physics-based model. The illustration of how components are shared and combined to form the machine and process is provided in Fig. 1. The physics-based model will be used to calculate the axial depth of stability border a cr , model ( x i ; \u03b8 j ) and chatter frequency f c, model ( x i ; \u03b8 j ) for a parameter sample \u03b8 j and process configuration of interest x i . 3. EMCMC utilizes prior probabilities P( \u03b8 j ) and the likelihood function P( y 1:n \u2223 x 1:n ; \u03b8 j ), Eq. (9), to collect samples from high-probable parameter space, driven by the fitness function Eq. (13). 4. The collected samples { \u03b8 j } by the EMCMC are used to estimate the posterior parameter distributions and to generate probabilistic stability maps, through Eq. (16) and Eq. (17), and information gain diagrams through Eq. (19). The validation process is carried out through experimental cutting tests on a GF Mikron HPM800U 5-axis milling machine with a variety of tool-holder combinations and process strategies. The holders used in the validation stage are listed in Table 2, which have been selected to assess the performance of the proposed approaches on distinct collet interfaces. The selected tools in Table 3 include two flat-end mills with similar cutting-edge geometry, coating, and wear state. This provides an existence of similarity for their CFCs when machining AL6082 workpiece material, for later case studies. Table 4 provides a summary of the machine and process configurations that have been taken into consideration for the case studies. This specifies the corresponding x with tool-holder combination, stick-out length, and process parameters required to define a scenario for calculating SLDs. Table 5 also provides the hyperparameters of the learning algorithm. Fig. 3 contains the probabilistic stability maps for the three distinct holder interfaces, which are generated using the general prior distribution of model parameters outlined in Table 1. These maps show an unreliable and highly uncertain inference of prior stability states and chatter frequencies, emphasizing the need for model refinement using experimental data. It should be noted that process configuration 1 from Table 4 is selected as a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of various Bayesian learning implementations. Also, Table 6 includes the experimental data points used for training in the subsequent sections. Supervised learning from offline dataset This section investigates the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian model updating framework in supervised learning across three different holder interfaces. Fig. 4 illustrates several scenarios related to this investigation. In the provided figure, the probabilistic map of stability states (a p -\u03a9 plane) denotes the marginal probability of stability states P(s * \u2223 x *, y 1:n , x 1:n ), which is calculated using Eq. (16) at each x * over a grid that covers the a p -\u03a9 plane. The dataset of experimental data { y 1:n , x 1:n }, which was used for refining the model parameter probability distributions, is also depicted as highlighted points in the figure. Likewise, the probability of chatter frequency P(f c *\u2223 x *, y 1:n , x 1:n ) is generated using Eq. (17) and depicted in the f c -\u03a9 plane. The validation cuts are performed experimentally and their stability states and chatter frequencies are recorded through process noise analysis recorded by a microphone. Further information on chatter detection methods can be found in a review article by Wang et al. [68]. Based on the results presented in Fig. 4, the effectiveness of the model refinement is highly dependent on the quality of the training dataset. In case (a), a poor dataset consisting of only stable cuts is utilized. While the location of the stable cuts may aid the algorithm in roughly identifying stability pocket locations, the confidence in classification is low, visible by a wide spread of the grey shades, due to insufficient information content of the training data. In cases (b) and (c), the inclusion of both stable and chatter cuts in training provides the algorithm with valuable information regarding chatter frequency, which is particularly beneficial for updating structural dynamics. However, it is important to note that the updated model is relatively unsure of stability states at locations on the stability maps that could not be confined by the experimental training samples. For example, in case (b), the model is uncertain about the stability states in the area between the stable and unstable training points. In conclusion, the proposed Bayesian model updating framework, supported by physical models, is highly effective in refining stability charts, even with poor training datasets. The framework can suggest highly productive stable process parameters to the machine operator based on the level of risk they are willing to take. It is worth mentioning that the full sampling procedure and generation of probabilistic stability maps for a training task were completed in around 38 s on an Intel core i7\u20139700 CPU. Federated learning and knowledge transfer In manufacturing industries, it is often the case that several CNC machines are present on the shop floor, and they may use similar holders, tools, or workpiece materials in their production. The federated learning concept offers a collaborative platform for all production machines to share their process monitoring data and simultaneously learn and refine their stability models. The substructuring framework, presented in Section 2, has empowered the algorithm to identify common substructures among all involved machines and processes to establish the connections for learning their uncertain parameters simultaneously. This allows the machines to learn from each other and accelerate the learning process, which can ultimately lead to improved process efficiency and product quality for all of them. Furthermore, the federated learning platform enables knowledge transfer for a more reliable initial estimation of stability states for new machine and process configurations for which no experimental training data has yet been collected. The federated and transfer learning concept is demonstrated in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 presents a scenario of federated learning, where cases (a) and (c) share the same holder and thus the same holder parameters. Additionally, all three cases use the same tool and cut the same workpiece material, thus having the same CFCs. The simultaneous model updating process involves only three experimental data points, one from each case. Despite the limited training data, the synergy created by the federated learning approach helped all cases to improve their stability predictions simultaneously, as is evident by comparing the experimental validation cuts and the refined probabilistic stability maps. In order to further illustrate the benefits of federated learning, the process configuration is kept constant for case (a) in both Fig. 4 and Fig. 6. By comparing the resulting posterior probabilistic stability maps, it can be seen that federated learning could lead to more accurate and reliable posterior predictions, e.g., the two stable points at a p = 1.25mm are predicted to be stable with higher certainty in Fig. 6 than in Fig. 4, despite the federated learning being provided with fewer training data points from their corresponding cutting scenario 1 (in Table 4) compared to the individual supervised learning in Fig. 4. The validity of the resulting posterior parameters in Fig. 7 is further assessed by comparing the variations of the modeled tooltip dynamics against impulse hammer measurements. The Monte Carlo simulation in Fig. 8 shows that the samples of the predicted FRFs are concentrated in the vicinity of the experimental FRFs, thus confirming the validity of the posteriors. Transfer learning is performed by using the posterior model parameters obtained from the federated learning (shown in Fig. 7) as priors for new process configurations where experimental training data is not yet available. Fig. 9 demonstrates three case studies where probabilistic stability maps are obtained via transfer learning. It is evident from the results that their prior predictions, i.e. with no consideration of training data in those special configurations, already have a satisfactory agreement with validation cuts. Recursive online learning and active learning Recursive Bayesian learning can be an effective technique for refining stability predictions in an online setting. As described in Section 3.2, this involves continuously monitoring process stability during arbitrary cuts and incorporating experimental data into the model to refine the probabilistic stability predictions. However, it may not be computationally efficient to perform a Bayesian updating iteration after acquiring each experimental record during an arbitrary cut, as the data may not contain enough information to improve the model. Instead, an informativeness diagram can be used to assess the informativeness of each collected data point and decide when enough informative samples have been collected to justify a Bayesian updating iteration. Fig. 10 represents a graphical summary of the recursive learning concept, and the flowchart shown in Fig. 11 demonstrates how the recursive Bayesian learning algorithm is implemented. Section 3.6 demonstrated that active learning relies on information gain to generate an acquisition function that enables informed sampling. The acquisition function in Eq. (18) is used for a recursive active learning case study in Fig. 13. Fig. 12 exemplifies the trade-off made by the acquisition function in recommending conservative experiments while considering informativeness. Referring to Fig. 13(a) is the informativeness diagram computed from the highly-uncertain priors of Table 1 before any training. The active learning acquisition function from Eq. (18) suggests the next training data collection at the spindle speed of 18870 [rpm] and depth of cut of 0.57 [mm]. This point is experimentally stable and is considered as a training point to compute the posterior stability prediction in (d) and the informativeness diagram (b). This procedure is continued for three iterations with the same pattern to gain the ultimate posterior stability prediction of (f). After training on three intelligently selected data points the model has swiftly reached to the precise and reliable stability predictions of (f). Conclusions This paper presented a constructive combination of physics-based and data-driven approaches to address the poor prediction accuracy of analytical models and the extensive effort required for experimental approaches. The Bayesian perspective acknowledges that the key model parameters correspond to a degree of uncertainty due to the limited understanding of real-world systems. This uncertainty is encountered by distributions of belief over potential parameter values. The novel integration of physics into the likelihood function enabled more effective learning by refining the model parameter distributions according to their agreement with experimental training data. The resulting probabilistic stability predictions may allow machine operators to balance their production rate and chatter risk. Additionally, the introduced online learning platform provided the means of refining stability predictions recursively through continuous process monitoring. Finally, the more effective closed-loop active learning method was introduced to drive the data collection process for accelerated learning of underlying models and improving stability predictions. In the end, the experimental validations revealed the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving stability predictions, even with extremely poor training datasets. The method solely necessitates a microphone for monitoring processes and gathering data, making it an industrial-friendly solution. The successful implementation of the proposed approaches can potentially have a significant value creation for manufacturing industries, where accurate stability predictions are critical for enhancing production rates while eliminating costly damages from chatter.

How to effectively identify mineralization anomalies from geochemical survey data is one of the key problems that must be properly solved in geochemical exploration. Although supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques have been adopted to solve this problem, the performance of the established mineralization anomaly identification models is not satisfactory because the mutual relationship between neighborhood data points is not taken into account in the modeling of geochemical exploration data. The graph convolutional extreme learning machines (GCELMs) provide a new technique for modeling the graph data transformed from geochemical exploration data. To improve the performance of mineralization anomaly identification algorithms, the GCELM techniques were adopted to establish the supervised classification models for identifying mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data. To improve the robustness of the GCELM models in mineralization anomaly identification, an ensemble classification model called voting-based GCELM (V-GCELM) model was established by voting the outputs of multiple GCELM models. The Baishan area of Jilin Province (China) was taken as the study area for carrying out an experiment of mineralization anomaly identification from geochemical exploration data. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used to alleviate the class-imbalance of the training data. The GCELM model, V-GCELM model and extreme learning machine (ELM) model were established for identifying mineralization anomalies, and their performances were compared in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curves (AUCs) and lift indices. The results show that the V-GCELM model has the best performance, and its AUC and lift index are 0.9989 and 28.6, respectively. The GCELM model has the second-best performance, and its AUC and lift index are 0.9977 and 20.1, respectively. The ELM model has the worst but still high performance, its AUC and lift index are 0.9402 and 9.2, respectively. The mineralization anomalies identified by the three models have close spatial correlation with the polymetallic deposits found in the study area, and spatially controlled by the main controlling factors in the study area. Therefore, GCELM and V-GCELM are promising techniques for building the high-performance classification models for identifying mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data.

In the past decades, many new mineral deposits have been found in China using geochemical exploration techniques. Geochemical survey data plays an indispensable role in mineral resource exploration. Identification of mineralization anomalies from geochemical survey data is a key step for mineral exploration targeting. Mineralization anomalies can provide important insights into the interdependencies and co-variations of chemical elements in mineralization systems (Hawkes and Webb, 1963a; Cheng et al., 1994; Reimann et al., 2005; Carranza, 2011; Agterberg et al., 2014). How to effectively identify mineralization anomalies from geochemical survey data is one of the key problems that must be properly solved in geochemical exploration. The application of contemporary scientific theory and technology to the modeling of exploration geochemical data can reveal the complex spatial correlation between mineralization and metallogenic indicator elements, and provide scientific basis for identifying mineralization anomalies. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have been increasingly employed to model geochemical exploration data to identify patterns and extract insights from massive geochemical data sets for effectively targeting mineral prospective areas. The machine learning methods used for geochemical anomaly identification mainly include one-class support vector machine (Chen and Wu, 2017a), Gaussian mixture model (Chen and Wu, 2019), K-nearest neighbor method (Chen et al., 2021a), distance anomaly factor (Chen et al., 2021b), bat-optimized isolation forest method (Chen et al., 2021c), dictionary learning (Chen and Shayilan, 2022), self-paced ensemble algorithm (Chen et al., 2023a) and self-training support vector classifier (Chen et al., 2023b). The deep learning methods mainly include deep autoencoder network (Xiong and Zuo, 2016), deep variational autoencoder network (Luo et al., 2020), deep convolutional neural network (Zhang et al., 2021) and Bayesian convolutional neural network (Huang et al., 2022). The above-mentioned machine learning and deep learning techniques can be divided into three categories: unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised learning. Unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as one-class support vector machine (Chen and Wu, 2017a) and Gaussian mixture model (Chen and Wu, 2019), identify not mineralization anomalies but geochemical anomalies because they do not take known mineralization information into account when modeling geochemical exploration data. Supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques, such as deep convolutional neural network (Zhang et al., 2021) and Bayesian convolutional neural network (Huang et al., 2022), identify mineralization anomalies by making use of known mineralization information in modeling geochemical exploration data. However, the performance of these supervised techniques is often affected by the class-imbalance of geochemical exploration data. In addition, deep learning techniques typically require a large amount of labeled data for effective training, which may not be readily available for geochemical anomaly detection tasks (Zhang et al., 2021). Semi-supervised learning techniques, such as self-paced ensemble algorithm (Chen et al., 2023a) and self-training support vector classifier (Chen et al., 2023b), can generally establish high-performance mineralization anomaly identification models because their performance is not affected by class-imbalance of geochemical exploration data. However, these semi-supervised learning techniques often ignore the correlation between neighborhood data points when modeling geochemical exploration data, which reduces the robustness of the mineralization anomaly identification models. Graph representation learning methods provide a flexible approach to manage complex relationships and dependencies within geochemical exploration data. Graphs, generally comprising nodes and edges, have powerful abstraction capabilities and can encode various data types, including geochemical exploration data. Graphs also effectively capture intricate and nonlinear spatial relationships among multiple nodes and their edges. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) leverage spatial relationships between nodes to extract geological features, such as distance and connectivity, improving the performance of mineral prospectivity mapping models (Guan et al., 2022). The graph convolutional extreme learning machines (GCELM) (Zhang et al., 2020, 2023) are hybrid methods that integrate GCNs with extreme learning machine (ELM) (Huang et al., 2006; Chen and Wu, 2017b) to solve graph data classification problems. The methods have the advantages of both GCNs and ELMs in solving supervised classification problems. By considering adjacency relationships, the GCELM model transforms traditional Euclidean data into graph data and processes information through graph convolution embedding and regression layers (Zhang et al., 2020, 2023). The GCELM framework inherits the benefits of classical ELM and GCNs. ELMs capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional data by modeling graph data, and surmount the limitations of traditional machine learning methods. GCNs extract spatial features and global dependencies. GCELM offers an interpretable model, enabling a comprehension of the decision-making process. Therefore, in this study, GCELM was adopted to model the graph data transformed from geochemical exploration data for identifying mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data. To improve the robustness of the GCELM model in the identification of mineralization anomalies, a voting-based ensemble GCELM model (V-GCELM) was built based on multiple GCELM models for identifying mineralization anomalies. The V-GCELM model makes decisions through majority voting among the results of independent GCELM models, and the final class label is assigned to the category with the highest probability (Zhang et al., 2023). Since supervised classification algorithms often struggle with class imbalance of the training data set in geochemical exploration, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) (Chawla et al., 2002) was used to alleviate the class imbalance of geochemical exploration data. A case study of applying GCELM and V-GCELM techniques to identify mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data was carried out in the Baishan area of Jilin Province, China. The ELM model, GCELM model and V-GCELM model were established on the 1:200,000 stream sediment survey data collected in the study area. The performance of the three models for mineralization anomaly identification was compared in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curves (AUCs) and lift indices (Chen et al., 2014, 2021c, 2023b; Chen and Wu, 2016, 2017a, 2019; Chen and Shayilan, 2022). The main contribution of this study is to adopt the new graph data modeling techniques, GCELM and V-GCELM, to establish a high-performance GCELM model and a high-performance robust V-GCELM model to effectively identify mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data, and provides an experimental case study to show the superiority of GCELM and V-GCELM techniques in identifying mineralization anomalies from high-dimensional geochemical exploration data. 2 Study area and data 2.1 Study area The Baishan area of Jilin Province (China) tectonically lies in the northern margin of the North China Platform, which covers four 1:200,000 standard geological maps. The area has experienced a long and intricate geological tectonic evolution history from Archean to Mesozoic (Zhao et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Qin et al., 2014). Throughout the geological evolution history, various geological formations were formed in the study area. Granite-greenstone and upper crustal rock assemblages were first formed in the study area during the Archean period, which constitute the paleo-crystalline basement (Wu, 1992; Zhang et al., 2011). Early and late rift formation assemblages were formed in the study area during the Paleoproterozoic period, which include the Ji'an Group formed in the early rift and the Laoling Group formed in the late rift. Sedimentary formations were formed in study area during the period from the Late Proterozoic to the Paleozoic. Volcanic-sedimentary assemblages were formed in the study area during the Mesozoic period (Zheng, 1995; Liu et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009). Among these geological formations, the Archean metamorphic formations and Mesozoic volcanic-sedimentary formations have the largest scale of exposure, accounting for about 25 % and 50 % of the whole study area, respectively. The study area belongs to the polymetallic metallogenic belt in the northern margin of the North China Platform (Yang et al., 1999), and 30 polymetallic deposits (occurrences) have been found (Fig. 1 ). The genetic type of the polymetallic deposits (occurrences) is mainly the post-magmatic hydrothermal type deposit, which is genetically related to the tectonic-magmatic activity occurred in Mesozoic. The main ore forming elements of polymetallic mineralization in the study area include gold, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt and molybdenum. The polymetallic mineralization occurred in the study area is mainly controlled by post-magmatic hydrothermal activity, regional faults and Archean metamorphic rocks (Wu, 1992; Zhang et al., 2011). The Mesozoic magmatic activity provided the continuous heat source, hydrothermal fluid, and some ore-forming materials for polymetallic mineralization (Zheng, 1995; Liu et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009). Archean metamorphic rocks constitute the source rocks of polymetallic mineralization and contribute most of ore-forming materials (Wu, 1992; Zhang et al., 2011). Regional faults are the migration channels and deposition space of mineralization-related hydrothermal fluids. 2.2 Geochemical survey data The 1:200,000 scale regional geochemical mapping project completed in the study area in 1990 s is in accordance with the standard for geochemical surveys (No. DZ/T0011-91) (Xie et al., 1997). A total of 6,608 valid stream sediment samples (Fig. 2 ) were collected in an area of approximately 26,500 km2. Each sample was analyzed for 35 major and trace elements. The unit of Ag and Au concentrations is 10-9; the unit of the remaining 27 elements is 10-6; and the unit of 6 oxides is 10-2. The mean, variance, and variability of each element were estimated based on the element concentration data of the 6608 samples (Table 1 ). To facilitate the mineral exploration process, the entire study area was divided into 100 \u00d7 150 unit cells. By referring to the spatial resolution of the unit cells, the stream sediment survey data were interpolated using the Inverse Distance to a Power method in Golden Software Surfer. The power value of 2 was selected to control the weight decreasing speed, and the search radius of 0.06 was chosen to control the number of samples used for estimating the element concentration value of the grid point. The grid points generated by the interpolation coincide with the centers of the corresponding unit cells. Accordingly, each grid point represents a unit size of 1.2167 \u00d7 1.6365 square kilometers. At the spatial resolution of the unit cells generated in this study, it can be determined that the 30 polymetallic deposits found in the study area are spatially distributed in 30 different unit cells. Consequently, only 30 grid points are polymetallic mineralized grid points. These 30 mineralized grid points were defined as positive instances, while the remaining grid points except for the grid points in blank areas were defined as negative instances. Due to the presence of undiscovered polymetallic deposits in the study area, a few of the negative instances defined in this study actually belong to positive instances, but are incorrectly defined as negative instances. These wrongly defined instances make up the noise in negative instances. Since the percentage of noise in negative instances is very small, these noise individuals do not significantly affect the overall statistical characteristics of negative instance population. Therefore,positive andnegative instancescan be used asthe ground truth dataforROC curve analysisto evaluate the performance of the classification models established for identifyingmineralization anomalies. 3 Methodology 3.1 Extreme learning machine A classical ELM is a non-traditional training algorithm for a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (Huang et al., 2006; Ding et al., 2015; Chen and Wu, 2017b, Wang et al., 2022). Unlike the traditional neural networks training algorithm that iteratively updates interlayer weights through backpropagation, in ELM, the weights between the input layer and hidden layer are determined by random initialization, and then the least squares method is used to learn the weights between the hidden layer and output layer, resulting in a fast-training process in its learning stage and a fast inference in its testing stage. One of the advantages of the ELM algorithm is that the parameters of each neuron can be randomly initialized at the beginning of training and fixed thereafter, thus avoiding the repeated parameter adjustments required in traditional artificial neural networks. Given N instinct training instances x i , t i , where x i \u2208 R n and t i \u2208 R m with i = 1, 2, \u2026, N, the linear ELM algorithm is defined as (1) \u2211 i = 1 N \u223c \u03b2 i f i x j = \u2211 i = 1 N \u223c \u03b2 i f a i \u00b7 x j + b i = t j , j = 1 , \u22ef , N where f x represents an activation function such as sigmoid, tanh, or radial basis function (RBF), N \u223c denotes the number of hidden neurons, a i is the input weight vector connecting the i th hidden neuron, b i is its bias, \u03b2 i is the output weight vector connecting the i th hidden neuron, x i and x j (i, j = 1, 2, \u2026, N) are the ith and jth training instances respectively, and a i \u00b7 x j represents the inner product of a i and x j . The N equations in Eq. (1) can be written in the matrix form as follows: (2) H \u03b2 = T where H is the hidden layer output matrix, and each column of H represents the output of the corresponding hidden neuron with respect to the inputs x 1 , . . . , x N . The solution \u03b2 ^ of Eq. (2) can be obtained by solving the following equations: \u03b2 ^ = H T where H denotes the generalized inverse matrix (Moore-Penrose generalized inverse matrix) of H . The ELM algorithm consists of the following three steps: Step 1. Define the number of hidden neurons N \u223c , randomly generate input weights a i and hidden biases b i (i = 1, 2, \u2026, N \u223c ). Step 2. Calculate the hidden layer output matrix H . Step 3. Solve the linear equation H \u03b2 = T using the least square method to determine the optimal output weight \u03b2 . 3.2 Graph convolutional extreme learning machine GCELM (Zhang et al., 2023) is a novel graph-based semi-supervised learning approach that combines the merits of GCNs and ELMs. The GCELM technique models graph data and attempts to leverage both the structure and node features to create an efficient learning classifier. The GCELM model provides a powerful and efficient framework for graph data classification, effectively combining the strengths of GCNs and ELMs. Its ability to handle both semi-supervised and supervised classification tasks make it a versatile and valuable tool in practical applications. GCELM first represents the Euclidean data as an undirected K -nearest neighbor graph (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Majumdar, 2018). Each data point is regarded as a node v i in the graph, and edges are determined by finding the K -nearest neighbors. The adjacency matrix A of the graph is constructed based on the neighborhood relationships. GCELM consists of two main layers. One layer is the randomized graph convolutional embedding layer, and the other is the graph convolutional regression layer (Zhang et al., 2023). Random graph convolution refers to randomly initializing weights for each neighboring node in each graph convolution operation and randomly selecting a portion of neighboring nodes to participate in the convolution operation instead of using all neighboring nodes. According to Zhang et al. (2023), the randomized graph convolutional operation can preserve structured information, and the features transformed by the random graph convolution always show better discriminative power than the original features with good diversity. Compared with the common GCN operation, the randomized graph convolutional operation does not need to iteratively update the trainable parameters using gradient descent. Incorporating the randomized graph convolutional operation into ELM not only improves the training speed, but also adapts better to different graph structures and data distributions, and improves the robustness and generalization performance of the classification model. The randomized graph convolutional embedding layer generates a random embedding matrix H for the input graph data to extract high-dimensional features of the graph nodes. It performs a random graph convolution on the input feature matrix X using a randomly initialized weight matrix W as follows: (3) H = \u03c3 AXW where A \u00af is the symmetric normalized adjacency matrix and \u03c3 \u2219 is the sigmoid activation function. Superior to the random mapping of ELM, the randomized graph convolutional embedding utilizes the graph structure and is robust to noisy data points. Based on the embedding matrix H and the labels of nodes, the output weight matrix \u03b2 can be obtained by solving the following ridge regression problem: (4) y = A H \u03b2 According to the ELM theory (Huang et al., 2006), the closed-form solution for \u03b2 can be expressed as (5) \u03b2 = H \u223c T H \u223c + \u03bb I - 1 H \u223c T Y T N T \u2a7e L H \u223c T H \u223c H \u223c T + \u03bb I N T - 1 Y T N T < L where \u03bb is the regularization coefficient, L is the dimension of the matrix H , I N T is denoted as a unit matrix of size NT , and the superscript T denotes the transpose of the matrix. In Eq. (5), H \u223c and Y contain both labeled and unlabeled entries, H \u223c and Y are divided into labeled ( H \u223c T , Y T ) and unlabeled ( H \u223c V , Y V ) parts. The detailed calculation method and procedure of the output weight matrix \u03b2 can be found in the original literature (Zhang et al., 2023). The label predictions Y V for unlabeled nodes are estimated by (6) yv = H v B The label with the maximum probability is selected as the prediction label of each node. The supervised GCELM training framework for extracting geochemical anomalies associated with polymetallic mineralization can be summarized as follows: Step1. Construct an undirected graph representation G = V , E , A using the K -nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Step2. Randomly initialize the weight matrix W for the RGConv embedding layer. Step3. Calculate the embedding matrix H = \u03c3 A \u00af X W using the input feature matrix X . Step4. Set H \u223c = A \u00af H and Y as the target matrix. Step5. Solve the ridge regression problem to obtain the output weight matrix \u03b2 = H \u223c T H \u223c + \u03bb I - 1 H \u223c T Y . Step6. Make predictions using Y = H \u223c \u03b2 . Step7. Select the label with the maximum inference value as the prediction for each node. 3.3 Voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine The V-GCELM is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple independent GCELM models to improve robustness and classification performance (Zhang et al., 2023). V-GCELM consists of a set of independent GCELM models, each trained with the same data set and with filter parameters generated independently. V-GCELM makes a decision by majority voting on the results of the independent GCELM models. For each sample, its probability of belonging to a specific class is calculated based on the number of GCELM models that classify it into that class. The prediction label is assigned to the class with the highest probability. V-GCELM is designed to address the issue of an unreliable decision boundary caused by the randomized filter parameters in a single GCELM model. The diversity of the GCELM models is achieved by the intrinsic randomness in the randomized graph convolutional embedding layer. The effectiveness of V-GCELM is guaranteed by a proposition that the V-GCELM model can correctly classify samples with probability one if only the number of independent GCELM models is sufficiently large. Fig. 3 shows the supervised classification flow chart of GCELM and V-GCELM for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data. 4 Results 4.1 Indicator element selection and data augmentation Indicator elements refer to the geochemical elements that exhibit genetic relationships with the deposits sought within the study area. Geologically, indicator elements typically constitute the mineralization or associated elements of a specific mineralization type occurred in the study area. Some researches (Chen and Wu, 2016; Zuo, 2018; Chen et al., 2021a, 2023a) have revealed a close spatial relationship exists between the concentrations of indicator elements and known mineral occurrences in a mineral exploration area. Out of the elements assayed in geochemical surveys, only a few can serve as the indicator elements for a specific deposit type in mineral exploration. The standard normal distributed statistic ZAUC can be employed to test whether a statistically significant spatial relationship exists between element concentrations and mineral occurrences (Chen and Wu, 2016; Zuo, 2018; Chen et al., 2021a, 2023b). According to Chen (2015), the AUC value for each element can be calculated based on the element concentration data and the positive and negative instances defined in Section 2.2. The standard normal distributed statistic ZAUC can be estimated according to the AUC value. According to the normal distribution hypothesis testing rule, the ZAUC value of an element should be greater than the critical value of 1.96 at the significant level of 0.05 if the AUC value of the element significantly differs from 0.5 (i.e., the AUC value of the random guess model). By referring to Chen (2015), the AUC and ZAUC values were calculated for 35 major and trace elements in this study (Table 2 ). According to the statistical results in Table 2, 17 major and trace elements, including Au, Ag, As, B, Bi, CaO, Cd, Cu, Hg, MgO, P, Pb, Sb, Sn, V, W, and Zn, were selected as indicator elements for geochemical exploration. Fig. 4 shows the contour maps of the 15 trace elements and 2 oxides selected for geochemical exploration. The grid data of the above selected 17 indicator elements and the ground truth data defined in Section 2.2 were used to construct the training data set for establishing the supervised classification models for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies in the study area. However, there are only 30 mineralized instances in the study area, indicating that there is a serious class imbalance in geochemical exploration data, which affects the performance of supervised machine learning algorithms such as GCELM and V-GCELM. The data resampling techniques, including over-sampling and down-sampling techniques, can be used to balance the number of positive and negative instances in the training data set. However, there are only 30 positive instances in the study area. If 30 negative instances are drawn from the negative population by a down-sampling technique, the training data set composed of 30 positive and 30 negative instances cannot meet the requirement for training GCELM model and V-GCELM model. Therefore, only the over-sampling techniques are suitable for this study. Through comparing the performance of different over-sampling techniques (it is discussed in Section 5), the SMOTE algorithm was selected for oversampling positive instances to balance the rate of positive to negative instances in geochemical exploration data. The SMOTE algorithm balances the positive and negative classes ratio by generating new synthetic positive instances (Chawla et al., 2002). The Python source code for the SMOTE algorithm is from the imblearn library (Lema\u00eetre et al., 2017). The hyperparameters of the SMOTE algorithm were set to \u201csampling_strategy = auto\u201d, \u201crandom_state = 42\u2033, \u201dk_neighbors = 5\u2033, and \u201cn_jobs = None\u201d, respectively. 4.2 Hyperparameter determination The Python source code for the GCELM and V-GCELM algorithms was obtained from https://github.com/zzj-cai/GCELM. The Python code for the ELM algorithm was obtained from https://pypi.org/project/hpelm. The original code was modified and integrated into a Python program for detecting polymetallic mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data. The SMOTE- augmented geochemical exploration data set in Section 4.1 was used as the training data set for establishing the GCELM model, V-GCELM model and ELM model. To make the GCELM model and V-GCELM model have the best performance in identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies, it is necessary to determine the optimal hyperparameter values of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model, such as the number of hidden neurons, regularization coefficient and neighborhood size. To simultaneously evaluate the impact of hyperparameter values and the impact of class-imbalance of a training data set on the performance of the classification model for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies in this study, the precision-recall (PR) curve, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and F1-score (Goutte and Gaussier, 2005; Davis and Goadrich, 2006; Boyd, 2013) were selected to measure the performances of the GCELM model at different hyperparameter values. When the PR curve is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model, it is sensitive to the ratio of positive to negative instances of the training data set. In the learning process of a classification model, training and test data sets are usually generated randomly from the original training data set at each iteration, resulting in the ratio of positive to negative instances in the training and testing data sets changing with the iteration process. Therefore, in the learning process of binary classification models, PR curves are often used to monitor the performance of the classification model. The PR curve of a binary classification model will approach the upper right corner of the precision-recall space only when the training data set is close to the class balance and the performance of the classification model is close to perfect. In mineralization anomaly detection, the PR curve of the model intuitively reflects the variation of model performance with the imbalance of training data sets. The AUPRC is a quantitative metric for assessing the overall performance of the model, with the value of 1 indicating the perfect classification performance. In addition, the F1-score is a composite metric that balances the precision and recall, providing a more accurate measure of the model's performance. The number of hidden neurons is one of the most critical parameters in the GCELM model. Increasing the number of hidden neurons enhances the model's complexity and expressiveness, thus improving its fitting ability and enabling it to better fit the geochemical exploration data. However, excessive hidden neurons may result in overfitting (Zhang et al., 2023). Decreasing the number of hidden neurons reduces the risk of overfit, but the model's expressiveness is diminished. According to Zhang et al. (2023), when the number of hidden neurons exceeds 10, the improvement of model classification accuracy slows down; when the number reaches 30, the classification accuracy stabilizes. Therefore, tuning is performed within the range from 10 to 30 with an interval of 2. Based on the results shown in Fig. 5 a, the PR curve is closest to the upper right corner and the AUPRC and F1-scores are the highest when the number of hidden neurons is 28. Consequently, the number of hidden neurons was set to 28 in this study. The regularization coefficient \u03bb needs to be optimized in establishing the GCELM model and V-GCELM model. In general, the GCELM model can achieve high accuracy when \u03bb < 1. If \u03bb > 1, the performance of GCELM declines sharply because an excessively large \u03bb penalizes the parameters of the output layer and leads to underfitting. In this study, the optimal \u03bb was selected in the range of 0.00005 and 10.0. Fig. 5b shows the classification performance of the GCELM model with \u03bb of 0.00005, 0.0001,0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0, respectively. It can be seen that when \u03bb = 0.01, the model has the largest AUPRC value 0.92, the highest F1-score 0.84, and the PR curve closest to the upper right corner. Although the model performance is not highly sensitive to the neighborhood size K, the hyperparameter K still needs to be optimized in establishing the GCELM model and V-GCELM model. in general, a too large K value will result in that the graph convolution produces similar embeddings for each node, which reduces discriminative power. Therefore, choose a range from 5 to 50 and adjust parameter K at intervals of 5 in this study. Fig. 5c shows that the AUPRC value of the model increases monotonically as K increases from 5 to 30, and tends to decrease when K is greater than 30. When the hyperparameter K is equal to 30, the model has the largest AUPRC value of 0.91, the highest F1-score 0.84, and the PR curve closest to the upper right corner. Consequently, the optimal K value is 30 for this study. 4.3 Anomaly detection models The training data set augmented in Section 4.1 was used to train the GCELM model, V-GCELM model and ELM model for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies in this study. The optimal hyperparameter values determined for the GCELM model in Section 4.2 (\u201cn_hidden\u201d = 28, \u201creg_para\u201d = 1.0 and \u201cn_neighbor\u201d = 30) were used to initialized the GCELM model. The GCELM algorithm discussed in Section 3.2 was used to construct the supervised classification model for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies. In the first step, the KNN algorithm was used to construct an undirected graph, which were used as the input graph data of the GCELM model. In the second step, the sigmoid function was chosen as the activation function for calculating the embedding matrix. The remaining steps were the same as described in Section 3.2. Zhang et al. (2023) used Friedman test (Hutchinson, 1996) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (Bergmann et al., 2000) and other statistical methods to test the stability of the GCELM algorithm after 30 independent runs, and found that GCELM lacked robustness. To solve the robustness problem faced by a single GCELM, Zhang et al. (2023) propose to merge multiple independent GCELMs and adopt majority voting for decision making. According to Zhang et al. (2023), the V-GCELM model can correctly classify samples with a probability of 1.0 when the number of independent GCELM models is large enough (i.e., 50 or more). In this study, the GCELM model shows a good performance but poor robustness in identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies. Therefore, a V-GCELM model was established on the basis of 50 independent GCELM models to improve the robustness of GCELM-based mineralization anomaly identification model. The 50 independent GCELM models were initialized with the optimal hyperparameter values determined for the GCELM model in Section 4.2, and then used to construct the V-GCELM model for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies in the study area. The training process of the 50 independent GCELM models was the same as that of the GCELM model. The outputs of the 50 GCELM models were majority voted to produce the final output of the V-GCELM model. In order to compare the performance of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model with that of traditional ELM model in identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies, an ELM model was established for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies in this study. To facilitate the comparison, the number of hidden layer neurons of the ELM model was set to 28, and the sigmoid function was selected as the activation function of the hidden layer neurons. The ELM algorithm discussed in Section 3.1 was used to establish the ELM model. 4.4 Polymetallic mineralization anomaly delineation and geological interpretation There are several methods to determine the threshold for binarizing the continuous classification scores produced by a supervised anomaly detection model for delineating mineralization anomalies. It has been documented that the mean \u00b1 2\u03c3 method (Hawkes and Webb, 1963b), fractal and multifractal methods (Cheng et al., 1996, Cheng et al., 2000), weight of evidence (WofE) contrast (Agterberg, 1992) and Youden index (Chen 2015; Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a, 2023a; Chen and Shayilan, 2022) have been applied to determine the threshold for the separation of mineralization anomalies from the background. The mean \u00b1 2\u03c3 method is one of the classical methods for geochemical anomaly delineation. This method determines the threshold according to the frequency distribution model of classification score data. The fractal and multifractal methods determine one or a set of thresholds according to the fractal or multifractal distribution patterns of element concentration data within the related spatial area. These three methods do not take the spatial relationship between mineralization anomalies and known mineral deposits into account when determining thresholds. Different from the aforementioned methods, the WofE contrast and Youden index determine the threshold according to the spatial relationship between mineralization anomalies and known mineral deposits and they perform very similarly in detecting mineralization anomalies. The threshold determined by the two methods is called optimal threshold because the mineralization anomalies delineated by the threshold have closest spatial relationship with known mineral deposits. In this study, the Youden index was used to determine the optimal threshold for separating polymetallic mineralization anomalies from the background because it is easy to calculate compared with the WofE contrast. The Youden index is defined as the true positive rate minus false positive rate (Chen, 2015). When using the Youden index to determine the optimal threshold, the Youden index corresponding to each possible threshold is calculated, and the threshold corresponding to the largest Youden index is defined as the optimal threshold (Chen, 2015). The larger the Youden index indicates the closer spatial relationship between the identified polymetallic mineralization anomalies and the known polymetallic occurrences. Fig. 6 shows the change curve of the Youden index of each classification model with the threshold value. The maximum Youden indices (MYIs) and optimal thresholds (OTs) of the GCELM model, V-GCELM model and ELM model were determined according to Fig. 6, and the optimal thresholds were used to delineate polymetallic mineralization anomalies in the study area. Fig. 7 shows the polymetallic mineralization anomalies optimally delineated using the optimal thresholds according to the classification scores of the GCELM model, V-CELM model and ELM model. It can be seen from Fig. 7a and b that the polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the GCELM model and V-GCELM model have similar spatial distribution patterns. The polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the GCELM model and V-GCELM model contain 97 % and 100 % of the polymetallic occurrences found in the study area, respectively. Compared with the polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the GCELM model and V-GCELM model, those identified by the ELM model obviously occupy more percentage of the entire area but contain only 90 % of the polymetallic occurrences found in the study area. Therefore, the ability of the ELM model to identify polymetallic mineralization anomalies is lower than that of the other two models. According to the above discussion, it can be seen that the polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the three classification models account for less than 10 % of the entire study area, but contain more than 90 % of the polymetallic deposits found in the study area, indicating that the polymetallic mineralization anomalies delineated in the study area have a close spatial correlation with the polymetallic deposits found in the study area. Therefore, the modeling results of geochemical exploration data are consistent with regional polymetallic mineralization characteristics of the study area. By comparing Fig. 7 with the geological map shown in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the polymetallic metallogenic anomalies identified by the three classification models are mainly located in the distribution areas of Archean metamorphic rocks and Mesozoic magmatic rocks, and are jointly controlled by NE- and NW- trending faults. According to the discussion in Section 2.1, Archean metamorphic rocks, Mesozoic magmatic rocks and regional faults are the three major metallogenic controlling factors (Wu, 1992; Zhang et al., 2011). In summary, the modeling results of geochemical exploration data are consistent with regional geological characteristics of the study area. 5 Discussion The consistency of the polymetallic mineralization anomalies delineated in the study area with regional mineralization characteristics was evaluated in terms of ROCs, AUCs and lift indices. The spatial correlation of the polymetallic mineralization anomalies with the geological characteristics was evaluated through the geological interpretation of polymetallic mineralization anomalies. The advantages and disadvantages of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model for identifying mineralization anomalies were discussed in terms of data augmentation, model performance and model robustness. 5.1 Model performance The performance of the GCELM model, V-GCELM model and ELM model for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies was graphically measured by using ROC curves. The overall performance of the three supervised anomaly detection models was evaluated by estimating their AUC values. The statistical significance of the difference between each anomaly detection model and random guess model was statistically tested by estimating the ZAUC value of each anomaly detection model (Chen et al., 2014, 2021c, 2023b; Chen and Wu, 2016, 2017a, 2019; Chen and Shayilan, 2022). Fig. 8 displays the ROC curves of the three supervised anomaly detection models. The GCELM model and V-GCELM model have the ROC curves closer to the upper left corner of the ROC space than the ELM model, indicating that the two models perform better than the ELM model in identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies. Table 3 presents the AUC and ZAUC values of the GCELM model, V-GCELM model and ELM model. The GCELM model and V-GCELM model have the AUC values 0.9977 and 0.9989, respectively, which are significantly higher than the AUC value of the ELM model (0.9402). Therefore, the GCELM model and V-GCELM model are superior to the ELM model in terms of AUCs in identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies. The ZAUC values of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model are far higher than the tabled value 1.96 at the significant level 0.05, indicating that the polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the GCELM model and V-GCELM model have a significant spatial relationship with the discovered polymetallic occurrences in the study area. The lift index (Chen and Wu, 2016) is the ratio of the true positive rate (TPR) to the anomaly area rate (AAR), serving as an indicator for measuring the spatial correlation between the polymetallic mineralization anomalies and the discovered polymetallic occurrences. A higher lift index indicates that the polymetallic mineralization anomalies account for a smaller proportion of the entire study area but contain a greater proportion of the discovered polymetallic occurrences. The true positive rates (TPRs), anomaly area rates (AARs) and lift indices of the three supervised anomaly detection models are shown in Table 4 . The polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the GCELM model accounts for 4.8 % of the whole area and contain 97 % of the discovered polymetallic occurrences. The polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the V-GCELM model accounts for 3.5 % of the whole area and contain 100 % of the discovered polymetallic occurrences. The polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the ELM model accounts for 9.8 % of the whole area and contain 90 % of the discovered polymetallic occurrences. The lift indices of the GCELM model, V-GCELM model and ELM model are 20.1, 28.6 and 9.2, respectively. Therefore, the GCELM model and V-GCELM model are superior to the ELM model in terms of lift indices. 5.2 Consistence with geological mineralization characteristics The polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the GCELM model and V-GCELM model are closely spatially associated with Archean metamorphic rocks and Mesozoic magmatic intrusions in the study area, indicating that these mineralization anomalies are spatially jointly controlled by the Archean metamorphic rocks and Mesozoic magmatic intrusions in the study area. In addition, the polymetallic mineralization anomalies are spatially distributed along northeastern direction and spatially coincide with the regional NE-trending tectonic zone in the study area, indicating that these mineralization anomalies are spatially controlled by the regional tectonic zone composed of NE-trending faults. According to the discussion in Section 2.1, the Archean metamorphic rocks, Mesozoic magmatic activity and regional faults are the three main regional polymetallic mineralization controlling factors in the study area (Wu, 1992; Zhang et al., 2011). Therefore, the results of polymetallic mineralization anomaly identification are basically consistent with the geological mineralization characteristics of the study area. 5.3 Advantages and disadvantages of the methods The GCELM algorithm is a combination of GCN and ELM, which is used to solve the classification problem of graph data. The V-GCELM algorithm is an ensemble technique for voting the outputs of numerous GCELM models, which improves the robustness of classification models. Compared with most machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as ELM (Chen and Wu, 2017b) and deep autoencoder (Xiong and Zuo, 2016), the GCELM and V-GCELM algorithms can make full use of the correlation information between training data points to capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional geochemical exploration data and improve the performance of the supervised mineralization anomaly identification models. This is because the data set used for training the GCELM model and V-GCELM model is the graph data transformed from geochemical exploration data, which can well describe the spatial correlation between neighborhood data points in geochemical anomaly identification, so as to improve the model performance in mineralization anomaly identification. This is also why the performances of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model perform better than ELM in polymetallic mineralization identification in this study. The GCELM model and V-GCELM model are more efficient than the GCN model because they incorporate ELM to accelerate the training speed without compromising their classification performance. Besides, the randomized graph convolutional operation not only preserves structured information but also exhibits meaningful discriminative power (Zhang et al., 2023). According Zhang et al. (2020), GCELM is generally superior to GCN with same settings in classifying 27 widely used classification datasets. The disadvantage of the GCELM and V-GCELM algorithms is that the performances of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model is seriously affected by the class imbalance of training data set in solving graph data classification problems. When the GCELM and V-GCELM algorithms are used to construct supervised anomaly identification models in geochemical exploration, a data resampling technique must be applied to balance the class distribution of the training data set because of the high class-imbalance of the geochemical exploration data. Therefore, the performances of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model depend on the data resampling technique used in the data augmentation in mineralization anomaly identification. In this study, four data resampling approaches were adopted to alleviate the class-imbalance of geochemical exploration data. Table 5 shows the performance measures of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model with respect to different data resampling techniques. It can be seen that the performances of the GCELM model and V-GCELM model vary with the data resampling approaches. Among these data resampling techniques, the SMOTE algorithm can make the GCELM model and V-GCELM model achieve the best performance in identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies. 6 Conclusion The graph convolutional extreme learning machine and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine were used to establish supervised classification models for identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies from stream sediment survey data in the Baishan area, Jilin Province, China. The performances of the graph convolutional extreme learning machine model and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine model were compared with that of the extreme learning model in terms of receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the receiver operating characteristic curves and lift indices. The results show that the classification performances of the graph convolutional extreme learning machine model and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine model perform better than the extreme learning machine model in identifying polymetallic mineralization anomalies. The voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine model has stronger robustness than the graph convolutional extreme learning machine model. It can be concluded that the graph convolutional extreme learning machine model and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine provide novel and effective techniques for constructing high-performance supervised classification models for identifying mineralization anomalies from geochemical exploration data. However, a data resampling technique, such as synthetic minority over-sampling technique, must be used to alleviate the class-imbalance of geochemical exploration data when building the supervised anomaly identification models. Compared with most traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques such as the extreme learning machine and deep autoencoder network, the graph convolutional extreme learning machine and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine can more efficiently make use of the correlation information between neighborhood data points to improve the model performance in mineralization anomaly identification. By converting high-dimensional geochemical exploration data into graph data and combining graph convolutional network with extreme learning machines, the graph convolutional extreme learning machine and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine can construct the high-performance supervised anomaly identification models from the augmented geochemical exploration data to capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in geochemical data as well as the spatial interrelationships between neighborhood training samples. Therefore, the classification performance of the mineralization anomaly identification model is improved. The polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the graph convolutional extreme learning machine model and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine model account for very small percentage of the total study area (<5.0 %), but contain almost all the known polymetallic deposits found in the study area (>96 %). In addition, the polymetallic mineralization anomalies identified by the graph convolutional extreme learning machine model and voting-based graph convolutional extreme learning machine model are spatially correlated with the regional polymetallic mineralization controlling factors such as the Archean metamorphic rocks, Mesozoic magmatic intrusions and regional NE-trending fault zone. It can be concluded that the results of polymetallic mineralization anomaly identification are basically consistent with the geological and mineralization characteristics of the study area.

Background Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and life-threatening disease in children, with a high early mortality rate. This study aimed to construct machine learning model to predict the risk of early death using clinical indicators at the time of HLH diagnosis. Methods This observational cohort study was conducted at the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disease. Data was collected from pediatric HLH patients diagnosed by the HLH-2004 protocol between January 2006 and December 2022. Six machine learning models were constructed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select key clinical indicators for model construction. Results The study included 587 pediatric HLH patients, and the early mortality rate was 28.45 %. The logistic and XGBoost model with the best performance after feature screening were selected to predict early death of HLH patients. The logistic model had an AUC of 0.915 and an accuracy of 0.863, while the XGBoost model had an AUC of 0.889 and an accuracy of 0.829. The risk factors most associated with early death were the absence of immunochemotherapy, decreased TC levels, increased BUN and total bilirubin, and prolonged TT. We developed an online calculator tool for predicting the probability of early death in children with HLH. Conclusions We developed the first web-based early mortality prediction tool for pediatric HLH to assist clinicians in risk stratification at diagnosis and in developing personalized treatment protocols. This study is registered on the China Clinical Trials Registry platform (ChiCTR2200061315).

HLH is usually divided into primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH) and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) [1]\u3002pHLH occurs primarily in the setting of an underlying genetic defect in immune function, whereas sHLH may be triggered by events such as infections [2,3]\u3001malignancies [4]\u3001rheumatic diseases [5,6]\u3001transplantation [7]and metabolic disorders [8]. The main clinical manifestations of HLH include persistent fever, mono/multilineage hemocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperferritinemia, hepatic impairment, and hematophagocytosis [9]\u3002 HLH is a clinical syndrome with multiple causes and variable changes in clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Some patients with mild cases of infection associated HLH may resolve spontaneously without specific treatment for HLH [10]. The treatment often leads to myelosuppression causing death in children with severe co-infections, and the long-term side effect of Etoposide in the regimen is secondary tumor development [11,12]. In children with severe or refractory relapses, complete remission may be difficult to achieve with the HLH-94/04 chemotherapy regimen, and more aggressive treatment is needed to save the patient's life [13\u201315]. HLH has a poor prognosis, with a median survival time of only 1.8\u20132.2 months without appropriate treatment and a long-term survival rate of less than 5 % [16].Early initiation of appropriate treatment is essential to improve survival of patients with this challenging disease [17\u201319].Therefore, stratifying the severity of children with HLH according to different clinical manifestations and laboratory tests and other findings, and constructing an early mortality prediction model are essential for assessing the progression and severity of HLH, taking timely interventions for high-risk patients, and improving patient survival. Machine learning is now widely used in disease diagnosis, prognosis prediction, treatment plan design and personalized medicine [20].Due to the relative rarity of HLH, the complexity of the patient's condition, and the often accompanying multisystem damage, machine learning-based early death prediction models for pediatric HLH patients have not been reported at home and abroad. This study relies on the Clinical Science Research Big Data Platform (CSRBDP) of the National Center for Clinical Research on Child Health and Disease and proposes to analyze a large number of clinical characteristics of real-world HLH patients to construct a machine learning model to predict the risk of early death in pediatric HLH and provide a basis for decision making in the stratified and graded management of pediatric HLH patients. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study Population and design This observational retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, one of two national clinical research centers for child health and disease in China that completed the Clinical Science Research Big Data Platform (CSRBDP) in 2021, which is available to clinical researchers and includes more than 750,000 pediatric outpatients and inpatients as of January 2022. The inclusion criteria of this study were as follows: \u2460 diagnosis between January 2006 and December 2022; \u2461patients with newly diagnosed HLH or who have been diagnosed out-of-hospital but have not been treated with hormone or etoposide (VP16) chemotherapy and whose diagnosis meets HLH-04 criteria; and \u2462 age under 18 years. Exclusion criteria: One of the following conditions was present and was not included in this study: \u2460clearly tumor- or rheumatology-related HLH; \u2461clearly diagnosed out-of-hospital with HLH and treated without immunochemotherapy. \u2462 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) within 30 days after diagnosis; \u2463 Patients who were lost to follow-up within 30 days after diagnosis. The study followed the Transparent Reporting of Multivariate Predictive Models for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) specification for model development and validation [21]\u3002Multidimensional clinical data were collected from the CSRBDP, and the study outcome was survival status within 30 days of diagnosis. The study was registered on the Chinese clinical trial registration platform (clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: ChiCTR2200061315) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University with a waiver of the informed consent requirement (File No. 2022,136). Fig. 1 presents an overview of the study design. 2.2 Data collection A total of 57 clinically relevant indicators of HLH were collected in this study, including demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory test information, potential etiology, and survival at 30 days after diagnosis. Demographic information included age at diagnosis and gender. Clinical and laboratory data were collected within 24 h of admission, or if this information was not available, the results of the first collection during hospitalization were used. The underlying etiology was assessed by medical history and laboratory tests. To ensure data accuracy, two clinicians separately interpreted the medical records, and the opinion of the third clinician was adopted in case of disagreement. Closing events were determined by assessing survival within 30 days of diagnosis. The main treatment plan was decided according to the judgment of the attending physician and the treatment wishes of the patient's family and included the following three types:\u2460immunochemotherapy group: including glucocorticoids + etoposide\uff08VP16\uff09 \u00b1 cyclosporin (CSA); \u2461hormone therapy group: only glucocorticoids and symptomatic treatment; and \u2462 symptomatic support therapy. 2.3 Model development The candidate predictor variables in this study excluded indicators with a missing rate greater than 30 %. For indicators with a missing rate of 30 % or less, the missing values were filled using the nearest neighbor algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor, KNN) [22]. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were applied to identify influential clinical variables (predictor variables with p < 0.05) to remove irrelevant and redundant information, select the best predictor variables, and improve the predictive power of machine learning models [23]. Random stratified sampling was used to divide the patients into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. The former was used to train the machine learning models and the latter was used to evaluate the model performance. The training set was used to train six machine learning models, including CatBoost Classifier (CatBoost), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (Logistic). The training set was preprocessed using random undersampling combined with SMOTE oversampling techniques to balance positive and negative categories. Grid Search and 5-fold cross-validation were used to find the best hyperparameters for the six models [24]. The best-performing model was chosen for risk prediction based on its combined metrics of AUC, recall, specificity, accuracy,Brier Score,net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).Decision curve analysis (DCA) for assessing the clinical significance of predictive models. The predictive power of the best machine learning models was explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [25]. Logistic models were visualized using a nomograph, and a shinyapp was used to build calculator tools on the web for clinical use by physicians. 2.4 Statistical methods Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.1.2), while predictive model construction and evaluation were conducted using Python (version 3.7). Continuous variables were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and non-normal continuous variables were presented as median with interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages (n, %). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables, and the chi-square test was used for categorical variables to compare the differences in variable distribution between the training and validation cohorts. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided P value < 0.05. 3 Results 3.1 General patient characteristics A total of 587 pediatric patients diagnosed with HLH were included in this study, comprising 306 males and 281 females, with a median age of 46 months. Among the 57 indicators considered, those with missing values exceeding 30 % were excluded, resulting in 37 indicators that were analyzed. Table S1 presents a comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients in the training and validation cohorts at diagnosis. The results indicate that there were no significant differences between the two cohorts, except for LDL-C, Crea, and CD3 and CD19 ratios, which differed significantly. 3.2 Analysis of potential etiology This study examined 190 (32.37 %, 190/587) patients for HLH-related genes, including PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, STXBP2, AP3B1, LYST, RAB27A, SH2D1A, XIAP, ITK, MAGT1, and CD27. Of these patients, 55 (28.95 %, 55/190) were diagnosed with pHLH, including 30 cases of FHL and 25 cases of other pHLH. No mutations in the HLH related genes were found in the remaining 135 (71.05 %, 135/190) patients. At the time of diagnosis, 534 patients (90.97 %, 534/587) had evidence of infection, and some patients had two or more pathogenic infections. Among thepathogens, viruses were the most common, with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) being the most prevalent (85.84 %, 491/572). Of the 491 patients with EBV infection, 197 underwent genetic testing, of whom 39 were confirmed to have pHLHtriggered by EBV infection. Table S2 shows the classification of underlying etiology in the 587 patients. 3.3 Overall survival A total of 587 pediatric HLH patients were enrolled in this study, and within 30 days of diagnosis, 167 patients died, for a 30-day post-diagnosis mortality rate of 28.45 %. In the training cohort, 119 died in the training cohort, and 292 survived, resulting in a 30-day post-diagnosis mortality rate of 28.95 %. In the validation cohort, 48 patients died, and 128 survived, resulting in a 30-day post-diagnosis mortality rate of 27.27 %. From 2006 to 2022, the 30-day post-discharge mortality rate of pediatric HLH patients showed a decreasing trend (Fig. S1). 3.4 Feature screening In the LASSO regression for feature screening, 37 candidate predictor variables were included. By adjusting \u03bb, the number of variables was reduced, which resulted in a simplified model. The number of clinical characteristics of pediatric HLH patients decreased continuously with increasing log (\u03bb) (Fig. S2A). By performing 10-fold cross-validation to find the optimal \u03bb value, LASSO selected 15 variables with non-zero regression coefficients at \u03bb = 0.034 and log (\u03bb) = \u22123.395 (Fig. S2B). The 15 predictor variables that were ultimately included in the follow-up study were TC, total bilirubin, ALB, LDH, BUN, FIB, APTT, TT, INR, bone marrow histiocyte ratio, treatment plan, presence of CNS-HLH, and presence of visceral hemorrhage. 3.5 Model development and screening The optimal parameters for developing the early mortality prediction model for HLH in children through grid search and cross-validation are presented in Supplementary Table S3. Two types of models were constructed based on the training cohort: six all-variable prediction models that included all 37 variables without LASSO regression feature screening and six post-screening prediction models that included 15 variables using LASSO regression feature screening. The ROC curves of the prediction model based on machine learning were shown in Fig. 2 . Among the six prediction models with full variable inclusion, the Logistic Regression model showed the best prediction performance with the highest AUC of 0.900 (95 % CI: 0.850\u20130.942), followed by the GBDT model with an AUC of 0.892 (95 % CI: 0.840\u20130.940) (Fig. 2A). Among the six prediction models constructed after LASSO regression feature screening, it was also the logistic regression model that showed the best predictive performance with the highest AUC of 0.915 (95 % CI: 0.871\u20130.953), followed by the XGBoost model with an AUC of 0.889 (95 % CI: 0.836\u20130.941) (Fig. 2B). In order to comprehensively assess the predictive performance of each model, this study calculated the accuracy, recall, specificity, and brier score of six models before and after LASSO screening and performed clinical decision curve analysis(DCA). Table 1 presents the performance parameters of the six models with all variables included, where the logistic regression model has an accuracy of 0.835, a recall of 0.750, a specificity of 0.867, and a brier score of 0.123. The XGBoost model has an accuracy of 0.812, a recall of 0.750, and a specificity of 0.835, and a brier score of 0.120. Table 2 shows the performance parameters of the six models constructed after LASSO feature screening. The logistic regression model has an accuracy of 0.863, a recall of 0.812, a specificity of 0.882, and a brier score of 0.115, while the XGBoost model has an accuracy of 0.829, a recall of 0.750, a specificity of 0.859, and a brier score of 0.121.In the clinical decision analysis, when all features were included for model construction, the SVM model had the smallest range of net gains greater than 0, the GBDT had the largest range of net gains greater than 0 (Fig. S3), and the Logistic intervened clinically in the predicted outcomes of the Logistic model at a threshold probability range of 0.051\u20130.835 (Table S4),At this point the Logistic model resulted in the greatest net benefit. After LASSO regression feature screening, the SVM model had the smallest range of net gains greater than 0, CatBoost had the largest range of net gains greater than 0 (Fig. S4), and Logistic intervened clinically on the predicted results of the Logistic model at a threshold probability range of 0.061\u20130.933, at which point the Logistic model delivers the greatest net benefit (Table S5). The net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement(IDI) analyses were performed for the predictive models. In the case of incorporating all the features for model construction, compared with the other five models (XGBoost, GBDT, LGBM, CatBoost, and SVM), the five NRIs of the logistic model are all greater than 0, and the P values are all less than 0.001, indicating that the logistic model prediction model is better than the other five models in local prediction effect; for IDI analysis, except for Logistic vs SVM, the IDIs of the other 4 models are all less than 0, and the P-values are all greater than 0.05, indicating that there is no difference in the overall prediction effect between the Logistic model and the other 4 models (XGBoost, GBDT, LGBM, and CatBoost), whereas for SVM, the IDI >0, and the P < 0.05, indicating that Logistic model has better overall prediction effect than SVM model (Table S6). In the case of LASSO regression feature screening, compared with the other five models (XGBoost, GBDT, LGBM, CatBoost, SVM), the five NRIs of the Logistic model are also greater than 0, and P < 0.001, indicating that the Logistic model predicts the model better than the other five models (Table S7). Overall, after LASSO feature screening, the prediction performance of the logistic regression and SVM models improved (0.900 vs. 0.915), (0.866 vs. 0.886), while the prediction performance of the remaining four machine learning models showed a slight decrease (Fig. S5). Therefore, to avoid overfitting and to align with clinical practicality, the feature-screened logistic regression model and XGBoost model were chosen as the final HLH patient mortality risk prediction models. 3.6 Visualization of feature importance To visually explain the selected variables, this study used SHAP to illustrate how these variables affect early mortality in the model. The feature importance ranking of the five prediction models, namely CatBoost, GBDT, XGBoost, LGBM, and SVM, is shown in Fig. S8. The model importance scores were calculated by the built-in attributes of different machine learning algorithms. Combining the feature importance rankings of the five models, the factors most associated with early death were the treatment plan, TC, BUN, ALB,TT, APTT, and INR. For the logistic regression model, 15 variables were used to construct Nomogram to visualize the model. Each risk factor's value is assigned a score on the point scale axis. By aggregating each score and using that value on the total scale axis, a total score can be easily calculated to correspond to the probability of early death in individual patients. The Nomogram present the effect of each factor on survival 30 days after diagnosis in patients with HLH, with the most important influences being prolonged TT, increased BUN, and decreased neutrophils (Fig. 3 ). For easier and faster predictive application in the clinic, a calculator tool was constructed on the web using Shinyapp (https://zheshiyigeceshi.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/). Screenshots of the calculator tool are shown in Supplement Fig. S7. 3.7 Interpretation of personalized predictions In this study, an analysis was conducted to enhance the interpretability of the XGBoost model by importing the SHAP package into the Tree-Explainer class. The SHAP explanation of the XGBoost model is shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4A displays the importance ranking of 15 risk factors evaluated by the average absolute SHAP value, while Fig. 4B shows the distribution of the impact of each feature on the model output results. The feature ranking (y-axis) indicates the significance of the prediction model, and the SHAP value (x-axis) is a uniform index that shows the impact of specific features on model output. Each dot in each row represents a patient, and the dot's color represents the feature value: red denotes a higher value, while blue denotes a lower value. Red and blue bars represent risk factors and protective factors, respectively; the longer bars indicate more significant feature importance. The treatment regimen is the most critical influencing factor, and the risk of death is greater in pediatric HLH patients treated with hormone therapy alone and symptomatic support. Early immunochemotherapy considerably lowers the risk of death in HLH patients. Decreased TC, increased BUN, prolonged TT, increased total bilirubin, and increased bone marrow histiocyte ratio all lead to an increased risk of early death in pediatric HLH. The SHAP-dependent plot\uff08Fig. S8\uff09 visualizes the top six clinical features that contribute to the prediction of the XGBoost model. To illustrate the interpretability of the model, we present two typical examples: Fig. 4C portrays a pediatric HLH patient with BUN of 5.29 mmol/L, total bilirubin of 157.7 \u03bcmol/L, an immunochemotherapy treatment regimen, TC of 5.11 mmol/L, and a TT of 26 s. In this prediction model, the 30-day early mortality rate was 4.97 %, with a SHAP value of \u22122.95. In Fig. 4D, a pediatric HLH patient with a symptomatic treatment regimen, TC of 2.29 mmol/L, total bilirubin of 164 \u03bcmol/L, and a TT of 20s had a 30-day early mortality rate of 88.99 % in the prediction model, with a SHAP value of 2.09. 4 Discussion This study is the first to utilize machine learning techniques to identify risk factors for early death in pediatric HLH patients and construct early death prediction models to assess the risk of early death in these patients. Two types of prediction models were constructed for the risk of death in HLH patients 30 days after diagnosis: six prediction models with full variables and six prediction models that were included after screening by LASSO features. The logistic regression model and XGBoost model, after screening for LASSO characteristics, were selected as the prediction models for the risk of death in patients with HLH through comprehensive evaluation. The importance of common features in each model indicated that the most significant factors for early mortality were the absence of immunochemotherapy, decreased TC, increased BUN and total bilirubin, and prolonged TT. To facilitate use, a web app was created to allow clinical staff to input patient-related information, quickly calculating the probability of early death for that patient and enabling early intervention, optimal treatment planning, and improved efficiency. The AUC for the logistic and XGBoost model in this study was 0.915 and 0.889. The better performance of the logistic regression model might be due to the smaller size of the training data, and the 15 clinical indicators selected after LASSO feature selection being more correlated and discriminatory, enabling the logistic regression model to better differentiate between samples from different categories. Frizzell et al. constructed prediction models for all-cause readmission rates 30 days after heart failure discharge using machine learning tree augmented plain Bayesian networks, random forests, gradient boosting algorithms, logistic regression, and LASSO. Their results showed that all five models had similar AUCs: 0.618, 0.607, 0.614, 0.624, and 0.618, with the logistic model being slightly better [26]\u3002 Several studies have shown that machine learning-based models have better performance than prediction models using traditional logistic regression. In 2022, Duan MJ et al. developed a CatBoost model based on machine learning to predict the risk of 30-day unplanned readmission in pediatric pulmonary hypertension patients, with an AUC of 0.81 Compared to the traditional logistic regression algorithm, the machine learning model showed significantly better performance, with an AUC of 0.72 [27]. In 2021, Ke Wang et al. developed a machine learning-based XGBoost risk stratification tool to accurately assess and stratify the 3-year risk of all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure due to coronary heart disease [28]. Although several studies have explored risk factors for early mortality in children with HLH [4\u20136], machine learning-based risk stratification models have not been reported. With the emergence of medical informatics, machine learning has become a important tool for intelligently assessing the conditions of patients' diseases. However, due to the opaque nature of machine learning, its application in clinical practice has been limited [29]\u3002SHAP is a game-theoretic technique developed by Lundberg and Lee to address the black-box nature of machine learning by providing consistent interpretability. SHAP values assess the importance of the output for all feature combinations and provide consistent and locally accurate attribute values for each feature in the predictive model [30]\u3002In this study, we performed interpretable analysis of the XGBoost model by importing the Three-Explainer class through the SHAP package. Our results showed that the factors most associated with the risk of death within 30 days after discharge from HLH in children were failure to use immunochemotherapy, reduced TC levels and neutrophils, elevated BUN and total bilirubin, and prolonged TT. Previous studies have demonstrated that the risk of death within 30 days of diagnosis is lower in pediatric HLH patients treated with immunochemotherapy regimens. The early use of immunochemotherapy is beneficial in improving survival, with more than half of HLH patients treated with the HLH-94 regimen achieving 5-year long-term survival, timely immunochemotherapy regimens can rapidly control inflammatory factors and reduce ensuing organ damage [31]. Our research group has also previously confirmed that decreased TC and elevated BUN are independent risk factors for early death in children with HLH [32]\u3002Lower cholesterol levels may impair the ability to regulate inflammatory immune responses and neutralize endotoxins in pathological conditions, ultimately leading to a storm of uncontrolled inflammatory factors [33]. Elevated BUN indicates that patients with HLH may have more severe circulatory perfusion deficits, infections, or acute kidney injury, which increases the risk of death [34,35]. Total bilirubin is a common indicator of liver impairment, and Honghao Ma et al. also found that high bilirubin levels are a poor prognostic factor for pHLH [36]. Previous studies have shown that coagulation disorders are common in patients with HLH and that abnormal coagulation increases the risk of bleeding and early death [37,38]. It has also been confirmed that severe neutropenia is a prognostic factor for early death in HLH, and that low neutrophil concentrations are suggestive of decreased immune function in patients, which may lead to an increased risk of death. This study has several limitations. First, the data used in this study were from the National Children's Regional Medical Center (Southwest Region), and more cross-center studies are needed to verify the validity and generalizability of the results. Second, as a retrospective study, this may have affected the model due to some missing information, such as NK cell activity, sCD25 and cytokine assays were not included in the study variables. Finally, external validation was not performed in this study. Future studies should conduct validation in other independent datasets to increase the reliability and generalizability of the results. 5 Conclusion This study introduces the first machine learning-based model for predicting early death in children with HLH, which exhibits excellent clinical applicability. The model can assist clinicians in making more precise prognostic predictions during early diagnosis and provide data to support early intervention for patients.

Bar-Ilan University Department of Management Ramat-Gan 52900 Israel An essential step in devising measures to improve road safety is road accident prediction. In particular, it is important to identify the risk factors that increase the likelihood of severe injuries in the event of an accident. There are two distinct ways of analyzing data in order to produce predictions: machine learning and statistical methods. This study explores the severity of road traffic injuries sustained by pedestrians through the use of machine-learning methodology. In general, the goal of the statistician is to model and understand the connections between variables, whereas machine learning focuses on more intricate and expansive datasets, with the aim of creating algorithms that can recognize patterns and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. The ability to handle very large datasets constitutes a distinct advantage of machine learning over statistical techniques. In addition, machine-learning models can be adapted to a wide range of data sources and problem domains, and can be utilized for numerous tasks, from image identification to natural language processing. Machine-learning models may be taught to recognize patterns and make predictions automatically, minimizing the need for manual involvement and enabling rapid data processing of enormous quantities of data. The use of new data to retrain or fine-tune a machine-learning model allows the model to adapt to changing conditions and enhances its accuracy over time. Finally, while non-linear interactions between variables can be difficult to predict using conventional statistical techniques, they can be recognized by machine-learning models. The study begins by compiling an inventory of features linked to both the accident and the environment, focusing on those that exert the greatest influence on the severity of pedestrian injuries. The \u201coptimal\u201d algorithm is then chosen based on its superior levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The developed model should not be regarded as fixed; it should be updated and retrained on a regular basis using new traffic accident data that mirror the evolving interplay between the road environment, driver characteristics, and pedestrian conduct. Having been constructed using Israeli data, the current model is predictive of injury outcomes within Israel. For broader applicability, the model should undergo retraining and reassessment using traffic accident data from the pertinent country or region. Keywords Pedestrian injury severity Classification machine-learning algorithms Feature list Road safety Prediction 1 Introduction 1.1 The scope of the investigation Pedestrians are widely acknowledged as one of the most vulnerable subgroups of road users. According to a pedestrian safety report [59], road safety for pedestrians remains a concern on a global scale. Worldwide, the rate of pedestrian fatalities has escalated almost twice as fast as overall road crash fatalities, with a 12.9 % increase from 2013 to 2016, as opposed to 6.6 % for other road users. Approximately 310,500 pedestrians lost their lives in road traffic accidents across the globe in 2016, constituting around 23 % of all road traffic fatalities (see Fig. 1 ). Within the United States of America, the period between 2008 and 2018 witnessed a 41 % rise in pedestrian deaths, while fatalities for other road users experienced a reduction of 7 %. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [4], in 2019, an average of one pedestrian was fatally injured in traffic crashes every 88 min. Further reinforcing this concern, two recent reports by the Governors Highway Safety Association [2,3] highlighted a 53 % surge in pedestrian fatalities in the US in 2018 compared with 2009. Notably, Fig. 1 shows that pedestrian fatalities exhibit a distinct geographical distribution, with the proportion of pedestrian deaths (out of all road-user fatalities) being highest in the African Region (40 %) and lowest in the South-East Asian Region (14 %). In India, pedestrian fatalities account for approximately 30 % of the total deaths resulting from road traffic incidents [14]. The proportion of pedestrian fatalities in major cities, such as New Delhi and Mumbai, ranges from 50 % to 60 % of all road traffic fatalities, while on national and state highways, it stands at 20 %\u201330 % [14]. A recent examination encompassing nine cities in India revealed that the percentage of road traffic fatalities involving pedestrians spanned from 22 % to 46 % of the overall death count [59]. This study endeavors to develop a classification model using machine learning aimed at forecasting the severity of pedestrian injuries stemming from traffic accidents. The model is based on three severity categories \u2013 fatal, serious, and slight. The model does not have universal (i.e., worldwide) applicability; instead, it is limited to estimating injury severity distributions in Israel. This is because the training process exclusively utilized data from traffic accidents in Israel during the period from 2009 to 2019. However, it is worth noting that the traffic conditions within Israel might also have relevance to other nations. Furthermore, driver and pedestrian behaviors exhibit fluctuations over time, even in a consistent environment. Accordingly, it is recommended that the model undergo continuous retraining, using new data, to uphold its accuracy and its predictive capabilities. The injury severity data presented in Fig. 2 is derived from Israeli traffic accident records between 2009 and 2019. In order to improve road safety, it is of utmost importance to study the factors that predict severe pedestrian injuries. Multiple investigations have addressed this question, uncovering factors such as alcohol consumption, operational mistakes, attributes of the vehicles involved, collision type, environmental influences, road quality, time of occurrence, and demographic traits of the pedestrian and driver (e.g., age); see Refs. [11,12]. 1.2 Review of the literature Prior studies have strived to identify accident patterns through the analysis of comprehensive datasets of pedestrian fatalities. In particular, researchers have tried to uncover features with a high impact on severe injuries, while removing features with a low impact, thereby allowing the development of accurate models to predict pedestrian fatalities and severe injuries. Al-Ghamdi [33] revealed the impact of demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, education, nationality, and social status. For example, young and old age groups of pedestrians are at an elevated likelihood of being engaged in pedestrian-vehicle crashes compared with pedestrians of intermediate age. Al-Ghamdi also identified the following risk factors: (i) pedestrian behavior prior to the accident (e.g., playing on the road, not paying attention, or failing to cross at a crosswalk); (ii) features of the environment (e.g., roads with high speed limits and residential streets); (iii) traffic control features (e.g., failed traffic light, blinking traffic light, priority sign); and (iv) vehicle type and weight. Wazana [35] also discovered that children face a greater risk of mortality and severe injury than pedestrians of other ages. Additionally, he reported a close correlation between the severity of the injury and (i) the environment (e.g., roads with high speed limits and residential streets) and (ii) the driver's demographic characteristics. Lalika [47] formulated a Bayesian logistic regression model to identify factors that influence pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries. During the course of his investigations, he noted that pedestrians aged 65\u201374 were the most susceptible group in road traffic accidents. As a result, the model delineated factors that contributed to the vulnerability of older pedestrians to injury, as well as potential interconnections among these factors. In a similar vein, Ballesteros [29] employed a logistic regression model to explore the association between the likelihood of pedestrian fatality and specific attributes encompassing the individual (age, gender), the vehicle (weight, type, engine size), and the environment (road condition, crossing characteristics). His main finding was that heavy vehicles (e.g., trucks, buses, and tractors), as well as luxury sports vehicles, were associated with a heightened risk of fatality or severe injury for pedestrians engaged in road accidents. This study also underscored the significant correlation between high-speed driving and the severity of pedestrian injuries. The previous paragraphs provided some examples of research that aimed to pinpoint factors linked to pedestrian road-traffic injuries. A full review of this literature is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the main findings can be summarized as follows. Research has demonstrated the significance of the age and gender of the individuals involved in the collision, with clear evidence of (i) a higher incidence of high-severity injuries in both children and the elderly [2,3,24], and (ii) a greater risk of severe injury in male pedestrians than in females [6,45,46]. Other significant factors include the driver's level of intoxication through drugs or alcohol [27] and the vehicle type and weight [29,33]. In the last decade, there has been a particular emphasis on examining characteristics of the accident location, such as urban vs. interurban roads [7] and whether or not the intersection has a traffic light [25,26]. In lieu of conventional data analysis methods, machine-learning techniques have been introduced as an alternative to examine the factors contributing to injury severity [3]. This approach enables valuable insights to be extracted from voluminous and intricate datasets. Standard machine-learning methods encompass decision trees (DT) [10], Bayesian networks [11], classification and regression trees [12], and random forest [13]. In addition to using machine learning to predict the factors contributing to injury severity, the technique has a role to play in selecting suitable input data for the development of such predictive models. The predictive models can utilize highly correlated factors as input features, thereby capturing the intricate dynamics that underlie the determinants of severity. A significant challenge in crafting predictive models resides in the non-linear relationship between injury severity and the multitude of factors present in an accident\u2014a challenge that machine-learning models can adeptly address. Machine-learning methodologies for constructing predictive models of injury severity include DT [14], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [15], k-means clustering [16], and Artificial Neural Networks [17]. Schneider [30], for instance, formulated a predictive model of pedestrian injury severity using the logistic regression algorithm. This model integrated traffic characteristics, environmental aspects (roads and intersections), and human error. It has been argued that the logistic regression model is more helpful in building severity prediction models than other machine-learning models [31,32]. Logistic regression models have revealed a high correlation between the severity of pedestrian injury in a road traffic accident and the driver's speed and features of the accident environment [31,32]. The main machine-learning (ML) methods that have been used in crash modeling include nearest neighbor classification, decision trees, genetic programming, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. These ML techniques have shown enhanced model performance when compared with statistical models. However, due to variations in error measurement methods across studies, a direct comparison of the performance of these different techniques is not feasible. The key explanatory variables used in modeling accident severity, in decreasing order of importance, are as follows: road-environmental factors, human factors, collision characteristics, and vehicle-related factors. In crash-based models, the most powerful explanatory variables are gender, age, vehicle type, vehicle age, season, time of day, and day of the week [52,53]. Among the analytical machine-learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a non-parametric statistical approach for classification and regression [52,55]. It predicts by identifying k neighbors in proximity to a response variable value based on their calculated distance. The anticipated response variable value is then determined from the k neighbors. Although KNN does not make assumptions about the functional form of the data [56], it can be sensitive to local data structure. Decision Trees (DTs) construct classification or regression models in the form of a tree that predicts the response variable's value by selecting the explanatory variable with the \u201cbest\u201d split at each level. While they are intuitive, the challenge with DTs lies in overfitting, which compromises generalization [54]. The Random Forest (RF), designed to mitigate the overfitting issue encountered with DTs, is a collection of uncorrelated decision trees that collaborate to make predictions [57]. Since the trees are assembled using a bootstrap aggregation method, they remain uncorrelated. The aggregate prediction from an RF outperforms individual trees in terms of accuracy. While not as straightforward to interpret as a DT, an RF offers a simple way of assessing the importance of each explanatory variable [58]. It is important to note that this research conducts its own feature selection process instead of relying on features identified in previous literature. The chosen algorithm for predicting injury severity is dependent on the input data, which in turn are derived by applying feature-selection algorithms to Israeli road-traffic accident data. The motivation behind developing a new injury-severity prediction algorithm was to explore a wide array of machine-learning approaches, some of which had not been utilized in prior research. Specifically, while previous models for predicting injury severity were generally rooted in various regression-based machine-learning algorithms, the findings of the current study suggest that decision-tree algorithms are likely to be better suited to this type of input data. A further contribution of this study is that it introduces a tool to calculate the potential financial savings resulting from policy changes, demonstrating a practical application of the model. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not analyzed the financial savings due to implementing policies to reduce severe pedestrian injuries. To sum up, the primary objectives of this study are to identify a set of features predicting injury severity among pedestrians in Israeli traffic accidents and to utilize these features to construct a machine-learning model that can offer practical solutions. 1.3 Objectives of the research The objectives of this study are threefold. 1. To pinpoint features that have a strong association of considering how seriously pedestrians are hurt in traffic collisions on roads. 2. To formulate a highly accurate predictive model for determining the severity of pedestrian injuries. 2 An introduction to the research methodology This study uses similar methodology to that applied in our previous study on machine-learning models for reducing the severity of bicyclist road traffic injuries [61]. The starting point of the present study was to produce a list of potential characteristics that might be associated with pedestrian injury severity. The next stage entailed selecting the most predictive features from this list and using them as input data when training a set of candidate predictive machine-learning algorithms. The flowchart in Fig. 3 depicts the sequence of actions for crafting and selecting the optimal predictive machine-learning model [61]. 3 Data The input data, sourced from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, comprised 47,432 traffic crashes involving pedestrians between 2009 and 2019. Of this total, 1392 crashes were fatal, and 46,040 involved a non-fatal injury to the pedestrian. The dataset contained 56 variables, including the unique crash ID, the year, date, and time of the crash, pedestrian and driver attributes (e.g., age group), accident location, and road features. The Israeli control authorities maintain Israeli traffic accident data using 14 different CSV files, each with a distinctive structure. In order to streamline, enhance, and improve the data querying process, and to ensure the integrity of incoming data, the set of files was loaded into an SQL Server relational database utilizing the data transformation utilities provided by SQL Server. Within this framework, three central entities are established: Accident, Injured Person, and Vehicle. Both the Injured Person and Vehicle tables were furnished with Accident ID columns, aligning with those in the Accident table. This interconnected design enabled data synchronization across the tables. To ensure data integrity, stringent data integration protocols were enforced. These included appropriate column data type assignments (such as integers, floats, and dates), establishment of foreign and unique indexes and default values. Foreign key indexes were also applied to the Vehicle and Injured Person tables. For a visual representation of the variables encapsulated within each domain table, please consult Fig. 4 . Note that this research uses the same database structure as that employed in our previous study [61], but in the present study, we extracted data that were related to the pedestrian as the injured party. The Accident table included a variety of attributes, the classification of the road type and the geographical accident coordinates (longitude and latitude). The Vehicle table captured details pertaining to the vehicle(s) implicated in the road traffic crash, for example, vehicle type and weight. The Injured Person table documented information related to the individuals involved in the accident, including both drivers and pedestrians. This category includes an injury range, from not injured to fatal, serious, and slight, gender, and age group. 4 Preparation of data and process of selecting features The predictive models (described in Section 6) were constructed using the Jupyter Notebook platform, which operates within a web-based environment and employs the Python 3.9 programming language for calculations. Jupyter Notebook serves as a valuable framework for machine learning. It offers functionality with respect to data analysis, model development, evaluation, and visualization, specifically tailored to research in machine learning. Moreover, it provides a wide array of integrated features optimized for machine learning purposes. The data extracted from the logical view of the SQL Server were imported into a Python Pandas Data Frame for preprocessing and assessment. Specifically, the following actions were taken. 1. Eliminate records where the severity of pedestrian injury is unidentified. 2. Substitute empty and NULL values of features with a suitable average value (either mean or median) for the respective column. Mean imputation is used when the missing values in a dataset column are numerical and the variable's distribution is roughly normal. When the distribution is skewed, median imputation is preferable because it is less susceptible to outliers. This study applied the Imputer algorithm from the sklearn preprocessing library to fill in the missing values. 3. Detect and remove outliers. The interquartile range (IQR) methodology and a visual examination of the data were used to identify outliers. IQR is a statistic that expresses the difference between a dataset's first and third quartiles, IQR = Q75 - Q25. Various feature-selection algorithms were employed to identify the most influential attributes, which would serve as inputs to the machine-learning algorithms. The following four feature-selection algorithms (where the names are those used in the sklearn feature selection module) were executed, with the outcome of each method (i.e., the list of influential features) provided underneath: 4.1 VarianceThreshold The Variance Threshold method was implemented by retaining features with a variance in excess of 0.05, as low-variance features do not contribute significantly to modeling. It is recommended to use a small threshold value, close to zero [50]. Applying this criterion, the 35 features outlined in Table 1 were chosen, meaning that these features exhibit a strong association with the severity of pedestrian injuries. 4.2 SelectKBest The SelectKBest algorithm scores the attributes and retains only the top k highest-scoring features while discarding the rest [50]. Employing this algorithm resulted in the identification of the subsequent array of features: pedestrian crossing location, engine capacity, vehicle type, vehicle weight, road illumination, weather conditions, road surface state, maximum permissible speed, road section, traffic control, accident location, vehicle safety measures, driver's experience (in years), day of the week, and pedestrian age. 4.3 SelectPercentile The SelectPercentile algorithm functions by choosing features based on a percentile of the top scores. This algorithm identified the following attributes: pedestrian's time of day, pedestrian's age and gender, pedestrian's crossing location, road's lane count, road width, road illumination, weather conditions, road surface state, maximum permissible speed, road type, traffic control, district, vehicle safety measures, driver's experience in years, and the day of the week. 4.4 SequentialFeatureSelector The sequential feature selector operates by incrementally adding (forward selection) or excluding (backward selection) features to construct a subset of features in a stepwise manner. During each iteration, this estimator selects the most optimal feature for inclusion or removal, based on the cross-validation score of a given estimator. In the context of unsupervised learning, the sequential feature selector [50]. The attributes chosen by this algorithm were: maximum permissible speed, vehicle type, pedestrian's crossing location, road illumination, vehicle safety measures, road's lane count, accident cause, accident location, day type, pedestrian's age and gender, traffic control, district of accident occurrence, and vehicle type. To consolidate the outcomes of the four aforementioned algorithms, we opted for the 20 features that occurred with the highest frequency across the algorithms. The conclusive list encompassed (see Table 2 ): vehicle type, vehicle weight, pedestrian's crossing location, road surface state, direction of the approaching car in relation to the pedestrian's movement, accident location, road illumination, lane count (in any direction), day type, time of day, pedestrian's age group, pedestrian's gender, road width, driver's experience, traffic control, accident cause, maximum permissible speed. The five variables that have the highest impact on the severity of pedestrian injury, as determined by assessing the average level of impact across all four feature-selected algorithms, were as follows: vehicle type, vehicle weight, location of the pedestrian's crossing, site of the accident, and maximum allowed speed. The second level of variables (i.e., variables that have less impact on the severity of pedestrian injury) includes the pedestrian's age group, traffic control, and the driver's experience (years). 5 The relationship between features and injury severity This section provides graphical representations of the relationship between selected features (those that strongly correlate with injury severity) and the level of injury severity. The feature selection algorithms did not take into account the co-correlation between variables when selecting the variables. The other variables (i.e., those not depicted in the following graphs) showed a weaker correlation with injury severity. The inference drawn from both these graphs indicates that there is a greater likelihood of severe pedestrian injuries with heavier vehicles. These findings receive support from various recent studies [29,32,33,36,37]. Fig. 5 illustrates the injury severity distribution as a function of the maximum allowed speed, demonstrating that the proportion of fatal accidents is higher when the speed limit exceeds 70 km per hour. This result accords with previous research [40,41]. Fig. 6 presents the distribution of pedestrian injury severity by day of the week. It shows that more road accidents involving pedestrians occur on weekdays than at weekends (Sunday is a workday in Israel). This finding may be due to the tendency of religious citizens in Israel to avoid travel on the Sabbath (Saturday) and the eve of the Sabbath, resulting in less heavy traffic on these days. This result contrasts with Europe and the USA, where road accidents involving pedestrians are higher on weekends [43,44]. Fig. 7 examines the severity of injuries in relation to road width. It can be seen that the proportion of fatal and moderate injuries increases with road width. For example, a 7\u201310.5 m-wide road has a higher proportion of fatalities than narrower roads. These results resemble findings in the Western world generally [44]. Fig. 8 presents the distribution of injury severity as a function of the accident's location. It reveals that the proportion of fatalities is higher when the accident is not associated with a pedestrian's attempt to cross the road. This discovery aligns with previous findings that the chances of pedestrian survival increase significantly when an accident occurs in a city at a junction with an orderly crosswalk [31,37]. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the severity of injuries in relation to the gender of the pedestrian. It reveals that women sustain more injuries than men, but that the rate of severe injury is lower in women (see Refs. [45,46]). 6 Assessment and appraisal of machine-learning models This section investigates a range of machine-learning classification models to ascertain the most predictive model for evaluating injury severity. This approach is commonly employed in machine-learning research, thus allowing the selected machine-learning algorithm to be labeled as a \u201ccutting-edge\u201d model despite its limited prior use. The evaluated models comprised the following: Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression CV, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Ridge Classifier, Ridge Classifier CV, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Perceptron, and K-nearest Neighbors. The choice of this particular set of algorithms was influenced by our past experience with their application. However, it is important to acknowledge that limiting the investigation to this selection could constitute a shortcoming of our study. The effectiveness of each model was assessed using the classification report, which contained the computed values of the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model displaying the highest values across these four metrics was identified as the \u201cbest\u201d predictive model under investigation. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are frequently utilized to gauge the efficacy of classification models. These metrics can be calculated using a confusion matrix, a table that contrasts predicted labels with actual labels to highlight a model's performance. The confusion matrix was employed to extract the aforementioned performance measures, as described in the subsequent paragraphs. Accuracy reflects the number of data instances within a particular class that are accurately assigned the correct label, relative to the total number of data instances of that class. The overall accuracy is then computed as the average accuracy across all classes [51], which is three in the case of the present study. Thus, accuracy was computed using the following formula: Accuracy = (True Positives_fatal + True Positives_serious + True Positives_slight + True Negatives_fatal + True Negatives_serious + True Negatives_slight)/(True Positives_fatal + True Positives_serious + True Positives_slight + True Negatives_fatal + True Negatives_serious + True Negatives_slight + False Positives_fatal + False Positives_serious + False Positives_slight + False Negatives_fatal + False Negatives_serious + False Negatives_slight) [61]. Precision is the proportion of correctly predicted instances of a given class out of all the instances predicted to have that class, averaged across all classes [51]. The general formula for precision is True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives). For our concrete case, we calculate precision according to: Precision = (True Positives_fatal + True Positives_serious + True Positives_slight)/((True Positives_fatal + True Positives_serious + True Positives_slight) + (False Positives_fatal + False Positives_serious + False Positives_slight)) [61]. Recall is the number of correctly predicted instances of a given class out of the number of actual instances of that class [51]. The general recall formula is True Positives/(True Positive + False Negatives). For our concrete case, we calculate precision as: Recall = (True Positives_fatal + True Positives_serious + True Positives_slight)/((True Positives_fatal + True Positives_serious + True Positives_slight) + (False Negatives_fatal + False Negatives_serious + False Negatives_slight)) [61]. The F1 score is a balanced combination of precision and recall, calculated as a harmonic mean [51]. The F1 score is computed as follows: F1 = (2 * Precision * Recall)/(Precision + Recall) [61]. The final metric that is reported in a classification report is the \u201csupport\u201d, which refers to the count of actual occurrences of a specific class within the provided dataset. When the support is imbalanced in the training dataset, it could denote potential flaws in the classifier's reported scores and may signal the need for rebalancing or sampling. The support score remains consistent across models, and therefore it is not useful as a means of selecting the \u201cbest\u201d model; however, it serves as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation process. The machine-learning models were developed using the scikit-learn package, which allows calculation of the aforementioned performance metrics. The initial step involved partitioning the clean, raw data into 2 different sets: training and testing. The training dataset encompassed 80 % of the entire dataset, with the remaining 20 % designated for testing. All data manipulations, such as shuffling and transformations, were exclusively applied to the training dataset. The test data remained untouched and were employed during the model evaluation phase to generate the classification reports. Table 3 outlines the performance metrics that were attained by the investigated models. Based on the performance metrics in Table 3, Extra Tree Classifier algorithm was identified by us as the most predictive approach for forecasting the severity of pedestrian injuries due to road traffic accidents occur in Israel. To enhance the accuracy of the Extra Tree Classifier, we employed the GridSearchCV algorithm from the scikit-learn package [50] to determine optimal hyperparameter values. Firstly, GridSearchCV evaluated the optimum amount of trees required for the Extra Tree Classifier across a range spanning from 10 to 5000. The conclusion was that the optimal count was 500. Following this, GridSearchCV investigated the impact of the number of samples at decision tree junctions before introducing a split, referred to as \u201cmin_samples_split.\u201d Values of min_samples_split ranging from 2 to 15 were tested, resulting in an optimal value (i.e., yielding the highest accuracy) of 10. As a result of these adjustments to the Extra Tree Classifier, its accuracy was elevated to 0.989 (relative to a previous value of 0.985). This study employed a machine-learning approach. An alternative methodology for anticipating the severity of pedestrian road-traffic injuries is to use statistical methods to identify traffic patterns across various scales: daily patterns, patterns on different days of the week, seasonal variations, and so on. These scales are generally simpler, quicker, and more cost-effective to implement than machine-learning methods. However, their accuracy is somewhat limited as they cannot handle extensive multivariate data as effectively. Convolutional neural networks have established themselves as reliable leaders in image recognition and analysis. A common application of these networks in the field of transportation is congestion detection, which utilizes images captured by road surveillance cameras. Recurrent neural networks, on the other hand, are designed to handle time-series data or observations collected over specific time intervals. Traffic patterns serve as a fitting illustration of such observations [60]. 7 Discussion 7.1 Contributing to the research The main goal of this research was to discover and establish the most accurate machine-learning model for predicting the severity of injuries suffered by pedestrians involved in road accidents. According to this study, machine-learning models play a crucial role in managing complex and substantial datasets. These algorithms offer an automated means of uncovering patterns and relationships within data, a task that can be challenging or infeasible when attempted manually. The Extra Tree Classifier method demonstrated exceptional performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.99, recall of 0.96, and F1 score of 0.98. Another promising option for assessing the severity of pedestrian road-traffic injuries is the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which closely trailed the Extra Tree Classifier in terms of its performance (accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.99, recall of 0.95, and F1 score of 0.97). This study identified the following features as having the greatest value as input data to predict pedestrian injury severity: vehicle type, vehicle weight, pedestrian's crossing location, road surface conditions, direction of approaching car in relation to pedestrian's movement when crossing the road, accident location, road illumination, lane count in any direction, day type, time of day, month, pedestrian's age group, driver's age group, pedestrian's gender, driver's gender, road width, driver's experience in years, type of traffic control, accident cause, and maximum allowable speed. Broadly speaking, these findings validate the main conclusions of previous literature examining the factors that influence injury severity [29,32,33,36,37,41,43\u201346,49]. However, the present study did not uncover any notable influence of driver alcohol consumption \u2013 a parameter that is well-recognized in the United States and European nations, and has been established as a leading contributor to pedestrian fatalities [4]. In prior studies of a similar nature, researchers have favored algorithms such as logistic regression [29,31,32], K-Nearest Neighbor [55], Decision Trees [56], and Random Forest [57]. The Extra Tree Classifier is a decision tree technique that significantly enhances the fundamental design of conventional decision trees. It adds a small amount of randomness to decision tree building, which can reduce overfitting and enhance generalization performance. To be more precise, it uses random selection rather than a fixed set of criteria to divide the data into subsets of features and thresholds at each node. With only a small number of hyperparameters to adjust, the Extra Tree Classifier is computationally efficient and can be trained on huge datasets. This makes it suitable for tasks requiring little processing power and for high-dimensional datasets. Relative to conventional decision trees, the Extra Tree Classifier is more resistant to noise and outliers in the data. This is because the random selection procedure makes it is less likely to overfit these occurrences. The Extra Tree Classifier is readily parallelizable, meaning that it may be used with distributed computing clusters or multiple processors, thereby resulting in a shorter training period. Finally, the Extra Tree Classifier provides a measure of feature significance, meaning that it can identify the most useful features and can enhance model interpretability. The benefits of employing tree-based learning algorithms include their capacity to train models on extensive datasets and their ability to accommodate both quantitative and qualitative input variables. Additionally, tree-based models are better able to deal with redundant variables and variables with high correlation, which may lead to overfitting in other learning algorithms. Trees also entail very few parameters that require tuning when training the model, and they perform relatively well in the presence of outliers or in cases where the dataset contains missing values. 7.2 Limitations and future research This study has limitations due to the database structureThe study was applied only to a single geographical location (Israel), due to the need to access to the relevant data, meaning that some of the conclusions may not be applicable to other countries. However, due to its method of operation, we anticipate that our conclusions about the suitability of the Extra Tree Classifier are likely to hold for models developed using data obtained in other countries. In addition to the aforementioned geographical limitation, the findings of this study may be limited to the time period encompassed by the database (2009\u20132019). Therefore, the machine-learning model should be retrained on a regular basis using the latest traffic accident data. This study did not examine the potential of a range of ensemble classifiers, including the Voting Classifier, Stacking Classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Classifier. Ensemble methods strive to amalgamate predictions from multiple base estimators constructed through a specific learning algorithm. This amalgamation aims to enhance generalizability and resilience compared to a solitary estimator. Additionally, the research did not delve into the efficacy of classification algorithms within the realm of deep learning, nor did it examine image processing techniques. These subjects warrant exploration in forthcoming studies. 7.3 Conclusion In order to formulate strategies to enhance road user safety, it is essential to develop the ability to predict the circumstances under which severe injuries are most likely to be sustained. This investigation underscored specific factors that exert significant influence over the severity of pedestrian injuries resulting from traffic incidents in Israel based on data collected between 2009 and 2019. The most influential features were: vehicle type, vehicle weight, the location at which the pedestrian crosses the road, the geographical coordinates of the accident, and the maximum permissible speed. The Extra Tree Classifier demonstrated the highest level of efficacy in predicting the seriousness of injuries sustained by pedestrians involved in traffic accidents in Israel.

Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) accounts for around 40% of the total building energy consumption. It has therefore become a major target for reductions, in terms of both energy usage and CO2 emissions. In the light of progress in building intelligence and energy technologies, traditional methods for HVAC optimization, control, and fault diagnosis will struggle to meet essential requirements such as energy efficiency, occupancy comfort and reliable fault detection. Machine learning and data science have great potential in this regard, particularly with developments in information technology and sensor equipment, providing access to large volumes of high-quality data. There remains, however, a number of challenges before machine learning can gain widespread adoption in industry. This review summarizes the recent literature on machine learning for HVAC system optimization, control and fault detection. Unlike other reviews, we provide a comprehensive coverage of the applications, including the factors considered. A brief overview of machine learning and its applications to HVAC is provided, after which we critically appraise the recent literature on control, optimization and fault diagnosis and detection. Finally, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the limitations of current research and suggest future research directions. Keywords Heating, Ventilation and air conditioning Machine learning Review Optimization Control Fault detection and diagnosis 1 Introduction Residential, commercial and other buildings account for around 40% of total global primary energy consumption and around 30% of the total related CO2 emissions [1]. Reduced energy consumption in buildings is therefore a key component in achieving sustainable long-term development and lower carbon emissions [2,3]. The energy consumed by heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) alone amounts to 35%\u201365% of the total energy, according to the type of building. A typical breakdown for public buildings is provided in Fig. 1 . HVAC, therefore, provides a substantial source of energy-saving potential. With increasingly higher energy prices globally, there is an economic motivation behind reduced energy consumption, as well as the environmental benefits. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) [4], the peak power load of countries with low HVAC penetration rate is expected to increase by around 45% by 2050. This huge increase has aroused concerns over the management and energy efficiency of HVAC systems. At the same time, people may spend 60%\u201390% of their time indoors, and various factors such as thermal comfort, visual comfort, acoustic comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) have a significant impact on the quality of life and comfort of people living indoors [5]. As economies develop, a greater emphasis is placed on indoor comfort, with higher requirements for HVAC control, while modern buildings are becoming more dynamic and complex. From Fig. 2 , it can be seen that an increasing number of households are installing air conditioning, which poses a challenge to the charge load, especially during peak periods of electricity demand, potentially compromising the safety of power grids. In addition to the main service systems of buildings, such as lighting and HVAC, more complex scenarios with on-site generation, energy storage systems and electric vehicle charging, are emerging. The stability and intermittency of on-site generation systems such as solar photovoltaics also presents challenges to the building service system. In order to achieve energy efficiency in the optimal operation of such grid interactive energy-saving buildings, flexible control methods are needed. The optimization of HVAC mainly has two goals: energy saving and improving thermal comfort. Traditional energy saving methods can only improve the performance of equipment, and have little effect on energy savings, while involving huge investments. Thermal comfort involves many aspects, including air temperature, radiation temperature [7], airspeed [8,9], and relative humidity (RH), as well as personal factors, such as metabolic rate [10], clothing insulation [11], possible age [12], gender, and adaptation [13,14]. Traditional control methods struggle to achieve great improvements in thermal comfort. With the development of economies and societies, accompanied by greater ambitions and disposable incomes, societies demand greater levels of thermal comfort while simultaneously developing a greater collective conscience with regards carbon emissions and energy conservation. In order to resolve some of the issues associated with finding a balance between thermal comfort and energy savings, machine learning has received an increasing level of attention. Machine learning is a set of tools designed to extract information from data, reshape data, learn complex patterns, and make informed decisions. It forms the algorithmic core of artificial intelligence (AI). It can also learn from an environment and optimize performance from experience with a feedback loop involving rewards and penalties. Machine learning has made rapid progress in recent years, driven primarily by the greater availability of data, access to increasing computational power and budgets, as well as theoretical advances. There have also been developments in sensor technologies (enabling more accurate measurements), the Internet of Things (making data easier to collect and more widely available), cloud technology (making data storage more convenient and reliable), developments in hardware technology, such as CPUs and GPUs, and new or enhanced programming, especially GPU programming parallelization. Alongside these developments there has been an enormous growth in the availability of open-source software, with the modularization of many machine-learning (including deep learning) techniques that can be called and combined within environments such as Tensorflow and PyTorch, based on the Python language. Furthermore, the are a vast number of online and offline resources for learning how to implement machine learning, frequently free to access and providing codes or code snippets. The aforementioned data, high-performance hardware devices and advanced online resources have jointly promoted the development and application of machine learning methods in various fields, such as games [16,17], automatic driving [18,19], autonomous Internet of Things [20], intelligent buildings [21\u201324], smart cities [25], wireless networks [26], energy Internet [27], unmanned aerial vehicles [28], smart micro grids [29], edge computing [30], and manufacturing systems [31], to name but a few. Machine learning methods were first applied to the control and optimization of HVAC systems around the 1990s. Since then, a great deal of research has been conducted on energy conservation and thermal comfort improvement. Many studies show that using machine learning methods to optimize HVAC can reduce energy consumption by 5%\u201330% and improve the comfort of residents. The most prominent machine learning methods in this area are artificial and deep neural networks (ANNs and DNNs), which are supervised. There are however, many other methods that can be employed, including support vector methods, Gaussian process models, kernel regression, dimension reduction techniques, and many others. Further discussion and classification of machine learning is provided in the next section. The main applications of machine learning to HVAC can broadly be categorized as energy management and indoor environment control. The first of these determines an optimal energy management strategy by analyzing data from buildings together with outdoor meteorological data. It can be used to predict energy consumption and develop energy management policies with the goals of reducing energy consumption and financial costs. Optimal control of HVAC systems can also be achieved using machine learning, by analyzing indoor and outdoor conditions. This is a complex problem that may involve several competing objectives (energy consumption, costs, comfort), and the prediction of occupancy rates and behaviors. Machine learning has also been used to a lesser extent for building design and planning, proposing better HVAC system solutions. A more active area is fault diagnosis, equipment monitoring and predictive maintenance of HVAC systems. Here, machine learning can be used to monitor and detect equipment faults and abnormalities, diagnose the root cause of problem and its severity, and for planning or scheduling maintenance. There have been several literature reviews [15,32\u201343] on the combination of HVAC and machine learning in recent years, as summarized in Table 1 . Some of these reviews only tangentially or indirectly cover machine learning or focus on specific machine learning techniques, and the majority are focused solely on control applications or more specifically on reinforcement learning for control. In this review we take a more holistic approach and review the broader applications of machine learning methods to the optimization, control and fault detection and diagnosis for HVAC systems, as well as the different objectives considered, including comfort, energy consumption and costs. We provide an overview and brief introduction to the different types of machine learning, and the potential applications of machine learning in HVAC. We review the literature in detail and analyze the shortcomings of current research, putting forward suggestions for future research. 2 Methodology of review and search We used multiple databases [46\u201348] to search for relevant literature with keywords \u201cMachine Learning\u201d \u2217 \u201cHVAC system\u201d \u2217 \u201cin building\u201d, identifying 221 papers. Preliminary relevance was determined according to the title. Further evaluation was based on the journal or conference, and abstract. The main principles for selecting papers were as follows: 1) Only papers published in peer-reviewed international journals or conferences are selected 2) HVAC systems located in buildings, excluding other environments, such as outdoor space and vehicles. 3) Only papers that use specifically machine learning methods to optimize the operation of HVAC systems. Based on the above paper screening, we conducted a comprehensive review of core papers. For convenience, we provided a representative of some of the core papers in Table 2 , along with key information. This information includes the type of building, machine learning methods used, whether to save energy or consider thermal comfort, the data sources, and comparison methods. Various types of buildings, especially offices, residential buildings, and campuses have been studied, with most studies considering energy conservation and a smaller number considering thermal comfort. In terms of energy conservation, a number of studies have provided energy-savings data, with claimed savings reaching 30% and over in some cases. Research data is generally measured (by sensors and other devices) or simulated from established models. In the next section we first provide a brief overview of the potential applications of machine learning to HVAC, followed by a brief review of machine learning and the types of machine learning used for HVAC. We then review the literature in detail. 3 Machine learning and its applications to HVAC 3.1 Potential applications of machine learning for HVAC Machine learning has great potential for improving the design and performance of building HVAC systems, aiding building managers in reducing energy consumption, improving indoor environmental quality, and reducing operating and maintenance costs. We now detail some specific applications of machine learning in this field. a. Energy management Machine learning can determine the optimal energy management strategy by analyzing the energy consumption data from buildings along with outdoor meteorological data. For example, it can be used to predict future energy consumption and develop more effective energy management policies to reduce energy consumption and costs using pure supervised machine learning or time series approaches based on machine learning. b. Fault diagnosis, equipment monitoring and predictive maintenance Machine learning can monitor the operating data of building equipment, detect equipment faults and abnormalities, and help to diagnose the root cause of problems. This allows for maintenance and repair to be carried out in a timely manner, ensuring the normal operation of equipment and extending its lifespan. For example, unsupervised learning is able to detect equipment abnormalities, including a sudden temperature rise or drop, or equipment vibration. c. Indoor environment control Machine learning can be used for optimal control of HVAC systems by analyzing data interior and exterior to buildings, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration. For example, machine learning can predict the number and behavior of indoor occupants, and adjust the operation of air-conditioning or heating systems accordingly to provide a more comfortable indoor environment. This, along with energy management are the areas in which the vast majority of applications of machine learning are to be found. d. Building design and planning Machine learning can be used for building design and planning, proposing better HVAC system solutions. For example, machine learning can help designers generate optimized design schemes by analyzing a large number of architectural design cases. It can identify which design elements or parameters have the greatest impact on the end result and guide the designer to make adjustments. In summary, machine learning is widely used in building HVAC optimization, control and optimal control, at various stages from planning to operation and maintenance. This review mainly focuses on the application of machine learning for the reduction of energy consumption and improvement in occupancy comfort. In the next section, we will review the literature related to these two aspects in detail. 3.2 An overview of machine learning methods for HVAC optimization and control The effectiveness of machine learning for HVAC and buildings has been widely demonstrated via a diverse range of applications. It is used for optimal control, fault detection and diagnosis during operation, building energy consumption prediction and energy savings optimization. Furthermore, it plays a huge role in the overall design of HVAC systems and intelligent buildings. There is a vast number and different categories of machine learning methods, and the choice of methods for a given task depends on the goal and the type of data available. It is also possible to combine different methods in a single study to achieve different goals or to perform sub-tasks towards a single objective. According to the nature of the data, we can divide machine learning into four categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning, as illustrated in Fig. 3 . The most common methods fall within supervised learning, which is based on data that takes the form of inputs and corresponding outputs (targets), arising from some process, system or even a model. The goal is to learn a mapping between the inputs and outputs, and this is achieved by devising a \u2018statistical model\u2019 of the process containing various parameters (or hyperparameters) that are estimated using (training) data. This estimation procedure, which we call \u2018learning\u2019, is based on either minimizing an error (loss function) between the predictions and targets, or maximizing a conditional probability of the targets, as a function of the parameters. In Bayesian learning, this approach is refined by seeking to sample (usually approximately) from a posterior distribution over the parameters, after appealing to Bayes' law. The outputs can lie on a continuous interval, leading to regression, or they can be categorical, leading to classification. In the latter case, the inputs are often said to be labelled, with the labels denoting different categories or classes, and from which corresponding numerical outputs can be defined. Common supervised learning methods includes linear regression, decision trees, support vector machine (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms, artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), naive Bayesian models, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), and Gaussian process (GP) regression (GPR) and other GP models in which the data is assumed to arise from a GP or mixture of GPs; these are only a small fraction of the methods available. Compared with supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not involve any outputs or labelled inputs; the data comprises a set of singular data points. The process of learning is similar to that for supervised methods, but the goal is now to infer or extract hidden internal structures within the data that can reveal important information. As well as extracting important features underlying the data (feature extraction or representation learning), which are essentially some linear or nonlinear combinations of the data coordinates (attributes), unsupervised learning can also group data points according to different criteria (clustering), or reduce the size of the data set, i.e., find an approximating subspace (dimension reduction). Unsupervised learning is often used for data preprocessing before the application of supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning can be considered as a fusion of supervised and unsupervised learning. It involves a relatively small portion of labelled data and a relatively large volume of unlabeled data. In principle the latter can be labelled, but it is frequently too time-consuming to do so. The labelled data can be employed to train an initial model, which is subsequently employed to make predictions for the unlabeled data. This can be achieved in different ways, e.g., confident predictions on unlabeled data are added to the labeled data to repeat the training process (self-learning). Compared with the static learning of supervised and unsupervised methods, reinforcement learning constructs artificial agents that take different actions in a given environment in order to learn dynamically, by maximizing cumulative rewards. Its biggest feature is learning interactively. Reinforcement learning is mainly composed of the agent, its environment, state, actions and a reward mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . After the agent executes an action, the environment attains a new state, and a reward signal (positive or negative) is assigned to the action taken. Subsequently, the agent executes a new action according to the current state and the reward feedback, with the ultimate goal being to learn a policy by maximization of a cumulative reward, in which the policy refers to the map between the states of the system and the action taken, and is usually assumed to be a probability distribution characterized by certain parameters. The value function represents a value for a certain state, or the expected return from a given state. Usually, the evolution is defined in terms of a Markov decision process. In the RL framework there are transition and reward functions, together which form the dynamic model. In so-called model-based RL the dynamic model is learned first, usually offline. Conceptually, therefore it is similar to the system identification step of model predictive control, described below. The development of a system model is highly time-consuming, and this must be weighed against the potential benefits in terms of accuracy. In model-free RL, the transition and reward functions are not learned a-priori. Here, there are several choices, the main being value-based, actor-critic and policy gradient approaches. In policy gradient, the idea to update the policy parameters by using the gradient of the expected cumulated reward, with respect to the parameters. In value-based RL, a parameterized value function is instead estimated, from which the policy can be found. The actor-critic approach works with both the policy and the value function. As in policy gradient, the policy parameters are adjusted according to a gradient, but this time the gradient of the value function with respect to its parameters, rather than that of the cumulative reward. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) uses DNNs for policy learning and has gained popularity in recent years. A number of DRL algorithms are available, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). There are, moreover, other types of learning, which are used with one of the aforementioned four categories. Two prominent examples are transfer learning (TL) and multi-task learning (MTL). In TL, data from a similar or identical task to that of the target task is used to pretrain a model (find initial values for the parameters and therefore specify the latent mapping) before training on the task-specific data. The inputs may be the same for the two tasks, while the target map is different, or the inputs are different, while the target function is the same. It may also be that both the inputs and target map are different. This type of learning can help to vastly improve accuracy and is widely employed. MTL refers to the learning of multiple tasks simultaneously, as opposed to independently. These tasks, along with the associated data originate from the same process, and are therefore correlated. MTL attempts to incorporate these correlations in the joint learning, which can help to improve the overall accuracy. In HVAC optimization and control, the machine learning approach generally requires prior knowledge or labelled data. The vast majority of algorithms are therefore either supervised learning or reinforcement learning, with semi-supervised and unsupervised learning rarely employed. There are some specific areas in which machine learning has been deployed in HVAC, which we now briefly describe before moving onto a detailed discussion of the literature in the next section. Advanced control algorithms for buildings can effectively achieve energy savings and reduce carbon emissions. For HVAC, model-based predictive control (MPC) has therefore gained much popularity, although in reality the up-front time and cost of these approaches has prohibited their practical deployment, with traditional rule-based methods continuing to be favored. MPC can in theory optimize HVAC systems, accounting for operating conditions, weather forecasts, electricity prices, and other factors, while simultaneously ensuring occupancy comfort and any operational and safety constraints. MPC relies on the use of an accurate HVAC model, and there has been a growing trend to replace physics-based with black-box (ML based) models due to a number of inherent difficulties with the former. The optimization objectives of HVAC systems are to reduce energy consumption and maintain comfort, which are conflicting. An MPC strategy can ensure an optimal balance between these conflicting objectives. MPC mainly comprises three components (illustrated in Fig. 5 ): modeling, prediction and control. In HVAC optimization, modeling refers to the dynamic building model. Prediction refers to predicting the system state in the future based on the current state and control inputs. Control refers to maintaining the predicted system state as close to the expected value as possible. The performance of traditional MPC control methods is highly dependent on the accuracy of the physical model. In order to improve accuracy, the usual approach is to increase the complexity of physical models or to use more sophisticated nonlinear optimization solvers. However, more accurate physical models rely on detailed, quantitative knowledge of the physical process and associated system parameters, which is not always available, especially in uncertain environments. Such models, when they are physics based, contain several thousands of parameters. Moreover, complex physical models and nonlinear optimization lead to higher online computational complexity and storage requirements, limiting their applications outside academic research. With different buildings having different characteristics, system and parameter identification is required for each new building, while the system parameters change over time, demanding some form of adaptive control that updates parameters online. Training offline ML or algorithms (as building models) is much faster than physics-based modelling. It is also possible, in principle, to rapidly update models online as new data becomes available. ML, however, also possesses drawbacks. Its predictive performance is highly dependent on the number of training points, and in many application fields such data can be difficult to obtain. Moreover, most black-box methods (especially deep learning) are not explainable, meaning that observed trends in predictions cannot be easily identified with physical laws and processes. ML in general does not provide performance guarantees, with the exception of probabilistic approaches such as GP models. This is a major drawback, especially in safety-critical applications. Accordingly, it is not difficult to see that a combination of machine learning and MPC that mitigates the shortcoming and leverages the advantages of each has broad prospects for optimal control of HVAC. Reinforcement learning has also gained much attention for optimal control, as an alternative to MPC, especially DDPG, which uses an offline training procedure to establish the policy. 3.3 HVAC control and optimization using machine learning In this section, we will discuss in detail the application and performance of machine learning methods in HVAC optimization and control. The optimization of HVAC systems is mainly aimed at reducing the energy consumption of HVAC and improving the comfort of users. Some studies consider peak electricity prices to reduce the cost to users. A great deal of research has been carried out on machine learning within this context. A breakdown of machine learning and other methods for optimization and control used in the research literature is provided in Fig. 6 . Some papers based on hybrid methods use more than one of these techniques. As explained in Section 3.2, it is very difficult to establish a reliable and transferrable thermodynamic model in HVAC. In Ref. [53], the authors therefore use a reinforcement learning algorithm, combined with a rule-based control method, so that engineering expertise can be used to define conditional judgment statements. This allows for the determination of reasonable ranges of system control variables under various working conditions. At the same time, a RL algorithm collects and analyzes the operational data (i.e., interacts with its environment), continuously improving the control strategy and optimization of the system. RL has been shown to be a possible approach for HVAC systems [124] but its advantages are offset by the requirement of increased sample complexity, requiring enormous amounts of data (interactions with the environment) to compete with a simple feedback controller [125], even with pretraining [126]. The long training time may explain the limited number of real-world applications of RL for HVAC control. In order to make feasible the approach, high-fidelity system models are required for pretraining of the agents [125,127], which introduces challenges in terms of simulation-to-real data transfer and once again places the emphasis on realistic models of the process. To solve the problem of sample complexity, Li et al. [128] as well as Jia et al. [126] used historical data from an existing controller to initialize the agent, as well as using the existing policy as a baseline [128]. In contrast, others [129,130] employed a model of the system dynamics in the RL framework, while Costanzo et al. [106] expanded the replay memory data using state-action pairs generated from a neural network, with batch-processing RL. In the approach of Nagy et al. [130] a neural network was trained to act as a model for state transitions, and multi-step planning was built into the RL. Model-based RL was found to be better overall than a model-free RL when taking into account sample efficiency and the end results (efficiency and comfort). A similar approach was adopted by Chen et al. [129] using an input-convex network developed in Ref. [131], validated using data from large commercial office buildings (16 thermal zones with temperature setpoints), although they only considered efficiency and not thermal comfort. To overcome the limitations of model-dependent RL and sample efficiency, Chen et al. [50] combined RL with a differentiable MPC strategy [132]. No prior knowledge is required in their approach, and only historical data is used to train the model. The method was tested on 3 different scenarios and was shown to be better than a generic neural network strategy. Similar to Refs. [126,128], the authors were able to avoid the need for a high-fidelity model by initialization (based on data from an existing controller). Azuatalam et al. [59] considered both energy savings and thermal comfort while implementing demand response, which presents challenges in terms of calibrating a systems model to capture the demand response. The authors employed a whole-building model and did not apply the algorithm to a real building. In Ref. [106], Shen et al. also incorporate demand response, for electric water heating (EWH) scheduling and control using a combination of data-driven forecasts in a robust MPC with an EWH model, applied to a domestic water heating system in a multi-unit apartment building. The uncertainty interval of the model was able to anticipate demand to within 97% of the actual demand and electricity costs were reduced by up to 33.2% without affecting user comfort. The obvious drawback is again a reliance on a non-transferrable model. Hao et al. [62] developed a novel multi-agent RL algorithm for optimal control of HVAC and planning of a power system, with each agent assigned to control a central HVAC system in each building. In this way it is possible to analyze the relationship the different HVAC control systems, and for the overall system to utilize data from a stochastic power grid, as well as weather conditions and human activity. Moreover, it can exploit past experiences to propose optimal HVAC settings. In Ref. [70], Lork et al. used aggregated data from households to train a neural network before devising individual models for the households in order to reduce data imbalances (some having more than others) as well as ameliorate overfitting. Specifically, they used a Bayesian CNN to model air conditioning in order to account for uncertainty in the planning. They then used a Q-learning reinforcement for AC control incorporating uncertainty arising from the models. Chen et al. [80], used a Q-learning RL strategy to control natural ventilation with a view towards both efficiency and comfort, and found it to be superior to a heuristic control strategy, although there was no comparison to MPC. Q-learning is again used to train a RL algorithm in Ref. [58], with the incorporation of eligibility trace to account for the slow thermodynamics of an underfloor heating system. There are no comparisons with other methods so the performance is difficult to judge. Although reinforcement learning has certain advantages in HVAC control, its disadvantages are also obvious. First, reinforcement learning needs a rich database. Second, it is not efficient and cannot be directly used in other systems. In Ref. [57], Deng and Chen used Q-learning with occupant behavior modelled as a Markov decision process, alongside transfer learning (TL) in an attempt to apply it to other buildings, with moderate success. It is worth pointing out that in HVAC applications, RL is almost always in the form of Q-learning. Biemann et al. [133] compared the performance of several RL methods, including a soft actor critic, twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradients (TD3), trust region policy optimization (TRPO) and near end policy optimization (PPO), in terms of energy conservation, thermal stability, robustness and data efficiency. The soft actor critic algorithm achieved stable performance with 10 times less data than other strategy methods. This study suggests that this algorithm should be explored in future experiments, especially real-world experiments, with more comparisons. ANNs have been used in a number of studies [54,83,85] to predict indoor conditions in order to control indoor environments and energy consumption. For example, in Ref. [100], the authors use an ANN for temperature predictions in a thermal model inside a MPC strategy for power efficiency. Similarly, connected ANNs in the form of LSTMs were used for each subsystem in a temperature set-point scheduling strategy developed by Kim [68]. In this method, the influence of electricity price is considered. There are relatively few studies on the key influencing factor of electricity price for reducing cost. In general, there are many cases where DR is used to consider electricity price. Yoon et al. [79] combined ANN and DR strategies to consider the optimization of electricity price. An optimization problem of price-based DR was established using an ANN, and was solved repeatedly to generate optimal HVAC load plan data for different electricity prices and building environments. Subsequently, another ANN is trained online to directly predict the optimal load dispatch. In this study, a single-layer decision-making structure is used to achieve the optimal retail price, which makes the pricing optimization problem simple and increases the scalability of the model. Amin et al. [110], used an ANN to establish a thermal response model of the building and integrate it into an optimal HVAC scheduling. In addition, the different thermal preferences of residents were expressed as a coefficient of the bid price (selected by the occupants) in response to the price signal. In solving nonlinear and multi-objective HVAC optimization problems, GA algorithms are extremely popular. It is a global optimization algorithm that simulates natural evolution, and crucially is gradient-free so that it does not require expensive numerical differentiation. On the other hand, its use is primarily restricted to complex multi-objective and high-dimensional optimization problems since it often sacrifices accuracy for the sake of finding a global optimum. GAs have been successfully applied to HVAC system control [134], green building design [135] and thermal performance of a refrigeration system [136]. In Ref. [63], Nasruddin et al. combine an ANN with a multi-objective GA algorithm to optimize a double cooling unit system with the percentage of people dissatisfied (PPD) and annual building energy consumption as the objectives. In Pombiero et al. [67], the authors compare dynamic programming with a thermal model to a GA with the same thermal model and finally a GA with EnergyPlus. The objective is to maximize user comfort while minimizing costs, with constraints related to thermal comfort and available electricity (from a PV/battery system), and cost. The GA with EnergyPlus yielded the best performance, but interestingly dynamic programming with a thermal model outperformed the GA with the thermal model. This is certainly worthy of further investigation, although the authors say little about this conclusion. Neural networks have a number of shortcomings, such as a large number of parameters, high model variance, a danger of overfitting, and a lack of systematic methods for architecture and hyperparameter selection, all of which compromise generalization. Although DNNs [137], which are essentially ANNs with more than one hidden layer, share these drawbacks, they are unrivalled in pattern recognition problems. The success depends on access to large volumes of data so that accurate learning is possible. Increasingly, DNNs have become more popular for HVAC applications compared to traditional ANNs [138\u2013141]. A deep MLP was used by Ikeda et al. [109] to predict the optimal operation of an integrated cooling tower system, and a meta heuristic method was used to optimize the operation of other components. The use of a DNN reduced the daily operational costs compared to a conventional scheduling strategy, although few comparisons were made. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has attracted attention for its advantages of easy realization, high precision and fast convergence. Like GAs, PSO algorithms are population-based methods. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms have been used in several studies [61,96,111] with good results. In Ref. [77], using historical measurements of outdoor weather, indoor temperature and HVAC system lag time, a deep MLP was developed to estimate the dynamic pre adjustment time of residential buildings. A novel control strategy is proposed by Li and Chen [74] to adjust the set value of the thermostat according to the clothing level and the average facial skin temperature. In this study, a new CNN model is established for clothing classification by using TL, and the clothing level of residents is measured in real time. TL plays an important role in machine learning in HVAC optimization and control. In practice, the target building may not have enough available data, and the combination of TL and DNN can help to essentially augment the data set. Potentially, TL can be used to provide predictions for a new target building accurately using limited operational data, which can greatly reduce the workload. Supervised learning can have a strong function approximation capability, but lacks decision-making ability. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, has good decision-making ability but is unable to deal with perceptual problems. Therefore, a combination of the two provides a solution to the perception-decision-making problems relating to complex systems. As illustrated in Fig. 7 , deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an end-to-end perception and control system with strong universality. The learning process can be described as: at each moment, the agent interacts with the environment to get a high-dimensional observation, and uses a DNN to perceive the observation, so as to obtain the specific state feature representation; evaluate the value function of each action based on the expected return, and map the current state to the corresponding action through some strategy; the environment reacts to this action and obtains the next observation. Through repetition of the above process, the optimal strategy to achieve the goal can be accomplished. In [21], Wei et al. applied DRL to HVAC control for the first time in the form of deep Q-learning (DQN). By constructing a DNN to associate the estimated value with the associated state action pair, a large state space can be processed, thus overcoming the drawbacks of traditional state action association algorithms. In Ref. [73], Gupta et al. an attempted to enhance heating control through DRL, but it used simple first-order linear simulation experiment, and the simulation results were not convincing. Valladares et al. [71], used an improved DRL strategy based on DQN to optimize the consumption of energy, taking into account thermal comfort, energy consumption and indoor air quality. A HVAC control algorithm based on a multi-agent DRL was adopted in Ref. [65] for minimizing costs in a multi-zone commercial building subject to dynamic prices, taking into account occupancy, thermal comfort, as well as air quality comfort. In Ref. [69], Brandi et al. highlight the importance of selecting the hyperparameters in DRL algorithms, though this is hardly an issue confined to HVAC. As stated earlier, tuning the hyperparameters and equally as important the architecture involve an enormous number of choices for complex networks. State-of-the-art randomized grid searches are far from able to search the entire design space, but at the present time are the best available options. Du et al. [72] proposed a MTL DRL in the form of deep policy gradient (DDPG) for both cooling and heating tasks simultaneously, in contrast to most approaches that focus on either one or the other. Comparisons to a single-task DDGP showed the MTL approach to be superior in terms of cost savings and user comfort. In Jiang et al. [75], under the premise of minimizing the energy cost under time-varying electricity price and demand electricity price, DQN with an action processor was developed, and a reward shaping mechanism was developed to overcome the problem of reward sparsity caused by demand charging. In Ref. [64], Wei et al. developed a DRL based heuristic algorithm to effectively distribute interactive workloads among geographically distributed mixed-use buildings (MUBs), thereby improving their energy efficiency. Zou et al. [108] proposed a framework to achieve optimal control of three air handling units (AHUs), utilizing an LSTM network to approximate the real HVAC operation, and combining it with a DDPG approach to achieve optimal control of the AHUs. In Ref. [95] Ahn et al. adopted DQN to improve the control strategy of a HVAC system based on prior behavior, status and reward. This study proposes a combination of TL with DRL for generalization to other buildings and enhance the self-learning ability, as did Deng and Chen [57]. Yoon and Moon [60] studied an integrated control method for a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system and a humidifier system. Rather than simply setting a temperature control, a DQN was used to derive the integrated control method for VRF and humidification. Current DRL approaches primarily treat the non-stationarity of building environments in a passive fashion, hindering their practical applications. Potentially, DRL can relearn the system dynamics, although this is time-consuming. To overcome this issue, Deng et al. [113] proposed a new HVAC control method (termed unsteady DQN), which combines active building environment change detection with DQN. This method aims to actively identify the change points of the building environment to eliminate the non-stationary. It was found to be superior to DQN in both single- and multi-zone control. Instead Lork et al. [70], used Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to model the performance and uncertainty of AC from aggregated data, and combined with Q-learning for set point decision making. MPC approaches non-stationarity via the nonlinear dynamics, and robust as well as stochastic MPC were developed precisely to take into account uncertainties in the dynamics. The authors in Refs. [70,113] fail, however, to make comparisons to these approaches, so it is difficult to fully assess the merits of their approaches. Zhao et al. [49] proposed a hybrid model-based DRL method to solve the HVAC control problem. This method uses both a knowledge driven model and a data driven model in the whole learning process. Ultimately, the protection mechanism and adjustment incentive method are used to further reduce the learning cost and overcome the shortcomings of low learning rate and high learning cost of DRL. Gao et al. [52] employed a deep MLP and Bayesian regularization to predict the thermal comfort of residents, which was combined with DDPG for thermal comfort control. A comprehensive comparison was made between DDPG and the widely used DQN method by Du et al. [76], and their results suggested that DDPG is more effective at dealing with continuous motion space and can achieve higher economic benefits while maintaining user comfort. The advantages of the combination of MPC and ML mentioned above have broad prospects for optimal control of HVAC. Numerous efforts in this area have achieved good results. The performance of MPC depends crucially on the accuracy of the prediction model. Nagpal et al. [51] used a robust MPC controller for the indoor climate of buildings based on a linear state-space model of the indoor environment with polytopic uncertainties, leading to a robust control problem in the form of LMIs, forming a semidefinite programming problem. The performance was 24% better than that of a nominal MPC approach, although no other comparisons were made. This approach is potentially very powerful, in that it leverages the advantages of robust MPC with a principled state-space representation of the environment. It is worth exploring the approach further for an optimal balance of computational cost and accuracy, given the plethora of state-space models and optimization approaches available. Lee et al. [55] developed a self-tuning HVAC controller, with a personalized thermal preference model, the transfer of thermal conditions and model predictive control (MPC) to form a closed loop. Based on occupant feedback and the personalized thermal preference model, Bayesian clustering and an online classification algorithm are used to determine the local operating temperature boundary of each radiant floor circuit. Ellis and Chinde [94] point out that the relationship between temperature setpoints and HVAC load is nonlinear, while the thermal dynamics of a building are linear or weakly nonlinear. This is used as a motivation for a purely data driven MPC strategy and in particular they adopt an economic MPC (EMPC) approach with an LSTM encoder-decoder to predict the temperature and cooling rate for a HVAC system. EPMC directly embeds an economic cost function into the MPC framework, which typically involves a quadratic cost function that is insensitive to economic costs. The model was validated using a case study generated in EnergyPlus. Starting from the definition of inputs and outputs, the model is trained and automatically embedded into the EMPC framework for real-time estimation and control. This novel strategy only partially offsets the total cost of build, configuration, and training of EMPC models, a major reason why they have not been adopted in practice. Fu and Zhang [98] proposed a hybrid control method based on TD3 and MPC. By pre adjusting the building temperature during off peak hours to reduce the function approximation error, they effectively avoid overestimation and improve the accuracy of energy consumption prediction and control of a HVAC system. A model-based reinforcement learning method was proposed by Zhang et al. [103], which uses ANNs to learn the system dynamics. MPC is then adopted to control the system by using the learned system dynamics and random sampling method. Compared with model-less RL, this method improves the training efficiency. Model-based RL has not been investigated as much as model-free RL, for reasons already stated. Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe that a model-based RL, although perhaps not as transferrable as model-free RL, can be superior for a given system with a well-constructed model. This is certainly worthy of exploration given the general reluctance of industry to adopt RL approaches. It is worth mentioning that non-machine-learning approaches continue to be developed. In Ref. [101], Xie et al. develop a distributed model predictive control algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to deal with system uncertainty and space-time coupling constraints. ADMM essentially deconstructs the optimization problem into sub-problems that are easier to solve. The algorithm has high scalability with the increase of the number of regions, and can protect the privacy of users. Li and Zhang [102] also took a non-machine learning approach based on a hybrid optimization algorithm composed of improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and Newton Raphson (NR) for a large-time delay single district heating system. The method was used for online optimization within an MPC framework applied to single district buildings. A distributed MPC method was proposed for multi area buildings with hydraulic coupling. It relies, however, on a complex model, unlike the model of Xie et al. [101]. 3.4 Objectives for machine learning in HVAC According to Table 2, 95.59% (65 papers) of the literature considered energy savings for HVAC, 89.71% (61 papers) of the literature considered optimization of thermal comfort, and 85.29% (58 papers) optimized the energy savings and thermal comfort together. It is evident that researchers have attached great importance to these two criteria. The indoor environment affects residents' health, productivity [140,142] and happiness [143,144]. In the architectural literature, there are several recognized comfort factors [145]. These factors include thermal comfort, indoor air quality, lighting and noise. Thermal comfort is widely considered to be the most important aspect among these different indoor environmental factors [146,147]. Ensuring thermal comfort and working performance is one of the main objectives of building environment regulation systems. Air quality, lighting and noise are less studied than thermal comfort. Fig. 8 shows the number of articles addressing different comfort factors, amongst those included in this review. It can be seen that most of the papers only optimize the thermal comfort, while a much smaller number consider the air quality. None of the articles address sound and visual factors. This immediately opens up a direction for future research, with HVAC systems optimized with a comprehensive consideration of all comfort factors. Fig. 9 shows the factors that affect building occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. There are six main factors that affect human thermal comfort. These six basic factors can be divided into two categories. The first category is environmental factors, including air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and mean radiation temperature. The second category is human factors, including clothing thermal resistance and metabolic rates. These factors need to be transformed into thermal comfort evaluation metrics when machine learning is applied to HVAC system optimization. A building thermal comfort evaluation model is the main way in which to judge a thermal environment. Thermal comfort evaluation models can be divided into two categories: thermal safety models and thermal balance models. A thermal safety model is used to ensure the safety of workers during operation, so this paper will not discuss such models. It should be noted that predicting thermal comfort is challenging since it is affected by several factors, including the environment and an individual's physiology and even psychology. Metrics such as metabolic rate or skin temperature may be used to quantify some of the factors but such measurements are not always readily available or practical and cost effective to gather for each occupant. In [50], Gao et al. propose a framework based on DRL, which defined thermal comfort control as a cost minimization problem, and designed an ANN based thermal comfort prediction model for residents. The simulation results showed that the thermal comfort of the members was improved by 13.6%. The thermal comfort cost (TCC) is introduced by Lymperopoulos and Ioannou [89], and the acceptable range of the optimal set point of the area temperature is determined based on the specified value of the predicted mean vote (PMV). In Ref. [97], Gao et al. use a DNN method with Bayesian regularization to predict the thermal comfort of residents by considering different influencing factors. Zhu et al. [85] develop a rapid prediction model for indoor environmental parameters (i.e. air pollutant concentration, temperature, and humidity), and ultimately achieve online control of a HVAC system by sequentially adjusting the optimal hourly air exchange rate, supply air temperature, and humidity. In the study of hourly air exchange rate, CFD simulations were conducted to determine indoor CO2 concentrations, temperature and humidity based on different input variables, ultimately to establish an initial CFD database. The initial CFD database was expanded using low dimensional linear models (LLMs) for temperature and ventilation. On the basis of the LLMs, an ANN was used to learn the map from inputs to CO2 concentration, temperature and humidity. Zhou et al. [149], developed a personalized thermal comfort model in which nonlinear regression is used to predict personalized metabolic rates and skin temperatures, which are fed into a physical heat balance model based on feedback from occupants. The solution algorithm enables the personalized thermal comfort model to be dynamically updated through online calculation. With the continuous updating of the model, changes in the residents\u2019 comfort can be tracked, and a high prediction accuracy can be maintained. The authors also considered other regression techniques, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), and decision trees (DT), finding that KNN gave the best performance in terms of predicting the thermal vote. In [150], Aparicio-Ruiz et al. proposed a general framework based on a dynamic adaptive comfort algorithm. The authors use KNN to learn the thermal comfort temperature of residents relative to the average operating temperature, so as to determine the appropriate indoor temperature range. Ghahramani et al. [151] developed a model for human face heat comfort based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In this study, infrared thermal imaging technology is used to provide real-time information about the thermal comfort of residents. The HMM based learning algorithm has three hidden states (uncomfortable warmth, comfort and uncomfortable coolness), and uses discrete modules to form the observation state of continuous infrared measurements. The effectiveness of the method was verified by experiments. Classification methods can also be used to develop thermal comfort models. In Ref. [74], an image classification model was trained based on a CNN to classify the clothing grade of residents, and a LWIR camera with face detection was used to obtain the average facial skin temperature of residents for the classification input. In Ref. [152], Salleh et al. compared six classification methods and PMV for predicting thermal comfort based on six thermal factors (air temperature, average radiation temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, clothing insulation and metabolic rate). They found that KNN worked best (80.41% accuracy), followed by DT, a CNN, SVM and kernel Na\u00efve Bayes. In addition, any data driven method was superior to the results obtained by modeling thermal comfort with the PMV model (22.68% accuracy). In this way, the results in Ref. [152] show that the ML not only has the advantage of being able to build models with only historical data, but it can also provide accurate thermal comfort models, and can even exceed the widely accepted PMV in terms of accuracy. Among the factors related to residents, building occupancy rate is the most critical factor and also the basis for studying residents' behavior. Fig. 10 illustrates the definition and impact of building occupancy rate. The occupancy rate of a building includes its existence status, number of occupants, and trajectory, which indicate whether the occupants are in a certain space of the building, the number of occupants, and how they move. Irregular and localized living have a significant impact on indoor environment and energy consumption. HVAC control requires a certain amount of pretreatment time, so the prediction of building occupancy is a very important factor for HVAC system optimization. Too low or too high an indoor temperature will cause thermal discomfort when occupants arrive, while also potentially wasting energy. Therefore, good occupancy prediction is crucial to the optimization of the system. However, the prediction of occupancy rate is complex, and the occupancy rate in buildings is often highly dynamic. With time, the flow of occupants can be highly random. In recent years, the concept of randomness [153\u2013155] and diversity of building occupancy has been widely studied and recognized [156\u2013158]. According to Table 2, 18 articles (26.47%) considered occupancy rate and user activity, and most of the studies did not consider the impact of occupancy rate on HVAC optimization, which suggests that a great deal more can be done on this vital topic. At present, there are several challenges in the research of occupancy rate, including data collection and data set establishment. Although a variety of data collection methods have been applied, such as occupancy and vacancy time questionnaires [160], motion sensors [161\u2013163], radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors [164], door sensors [165], Bluetooth beacons [166] and mobile phone records [167], it is still challenging to obtain occupancy related data in buildings due to accuracy and privacy issues. However, with the development of the Internet of Things, data acquisition can be improved. A new challenge is how to mine and process these data. Another challenge is to consider the natural characteristics of building use. The prediction accuracy can be improved by combining natural features such as time and space features with machine learning methods. In addition, different event related drivers must be considered. Predicting occupancy can be approached in different ways, including classification methods to predict occupancy states or regression to predict departure/arrival times. In Ref. [168], Esrafilian-Najafabadi and Haghighat analyzed the impact of different approaches on the performance of residential based HVAC control systems. The effectiveness of using different ML techniques in predictive control systems, namely DT, KNN, a MLP and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), was also evaluated. The authors found that the classification methods were generally the best performing, with either KNN or DT being the best, depending on whether the objective was thermal comfort or energy savings. There are, however, many specialized time-series methods that are arguably more appropriate for occupancy prediction, being as it is a sequence problem. Among the many methods are linear state-space models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and their variants, as well as Kalman filters. There are also nonlinear state-space models such as HMMs and Gaussian process dynamical models, as well as agent-based models. Moreover, purely supervised ML approaches with data embeddings can also be used. These specialized methods have not been explored to any great extent in HVAC research, with most of the focus placed on RNNs, which are more suitable for natural language processing rather than time-series problems. As alluded to in the previous section, in RL, the occupancy can be modelled as MDP, namely we seek to maximize the return in a MDP. An MDP is defined by the set of states of the system, the set of actions than can be executed, a probability distribution over the states from a given state and with a given action, and finally a reward function that assigns a reward to transitions between states for a given action. Deng and Chen [57] used a MDP to simulate the behavior of residents, combined with Q-learning to control occupancy comfort. The perfect occupancy prediction assumption is considered in Ref. [77] to eliminate the impact of uncertainty related to occupancy prediction and estimate the upper limit of system performance. A rule-based control is implemented alongside a deep MLP that uses historical weather conditions to learn a map between these conditions and the lag time (or preconditioning time) of a HVAC system. The results show that occupancy-based control systems can increase energy consumption by up to 10%, while using a conservative setback can compromise financial savings, leading to long payback periods with the use of smart thermostats. These negative impacts highlight the need to consider peak demand management when developing occupancy-based control systems. Wang et al. [112] used a vision-based camera for identifying the activities of indoor residents and equipment, and for calculating the real-time value of internal heat from residents and equipment. Feeding this information into energy and thermal models, thermal dissatisfaction was predicted using ANNs. Vosughi et al. [90] used a Markov jump linear system model to capture the thermal process of buildings, HVAC systems, and occupant movement, which they combined with a classical PID controller. This method can respond to the location changes of building occupants in real time. The proposed control scheme used real-time temperature and occupant position sensing, as well as a combined model of building thermal process and occupant movement. A Q-learning control strategy was proposed by Chen et al. [80] for a HVAC system and window operation involving natural ventilation. The authors compared the results to a rule-based control and demonstrated significant improvements. Window activity is an important human factor, but at present it is usually neglected. According to Table 2, 27 papers have provided specific energy saving percentages, among which the research results of Zhu et al. [85] suggest that the total energy consumption of HVAC systems can be reduced by up to an impressive 35%. Although the comparison strategy and simulation strategy used in each study are different, ML can achieve considerable energy savings for HVAC systems. Considering electricity price can further reduce the cost for users. The price of electricity is high in the peak use period, when HVAC is most frequently used. The optimization strategy proposed by. Kim et al. [78] obtains the optimal solution under various conditions of a given electricity price and building heat conditions. The authors use a deep nonlinear auto-regressive network with delayed inputs to directly determine the optimal DR scheduling. The proposed method maintains the load transfer ability of the air conditioning system to time-varying electricity price. Yoon et al. [79], used an ANN model to establish an optimization problem for price-based DR, and the problem was solved repeatedly to generate optimal HVAC load plan data for different electricity prices and building environments. By using the ANN metamodel (or surrogate model) to replace the DR optimization problem, the optimal retail price can be achieved by using a single-layer decision-making structure. This study simplifies the pricing optimization problem, and therefore makes the HVAC system easier to implement in large distribution networks. RL can be time consuming by virtue of the heuristic search. Moreover, especially in the early learning stage, the exploration-vs-exploitation mechanism can be unstable, and large step sizes can lead to poor control [106]. An alternative paradigm is to develop data-driven HVAC and building models offline first and to train the RL agent with data obtained from these models, as was done in Refs. [52,108]. Similarly, Jang et al. [68] developed a model for indoor temperature control in a commercial building by establishing LTSM models for three sub-systems (thermostat controller, HVAC unit, and building envelope), given next-day forecasts of the electricity price. The ANN models were integrated to establish an optimization problem to schedule the temperature set-point. To avoid overfitting, the ANNs were trained online. Compared to predetermined set-point scheduling, a physics-based model and other ML based strategies, their model was shown to be effective in terms of cost. The hybrid TD3-MPC control method of Fu and Zhang [98] considers both the electricity price and thermal comfort. The function approximation error is reduced and the costs lowered by pre-adjusting the building temperature during off-peak hours. A modified time of use (TOU) tariff was used in Ref. [93] to simulate the total operating cost (TOC). With developments in building intelligence, renewables and energy storage, photovoltaic, wind, battery, thermal storage and other technologies are increasingly used to supply power to buildings. The optimization of HVAC systems in different types of power grids and in different settings is one of the directions that needs to be explored in the future. 3.5 Fault detection and diagnostics California conducted air conditioning inspections on 13000 air conditioning systems, and the results showed that 65% of residential units and 71% of commercial units needed repairs [169]. Insufficient maintenance, degraded component functionality, installation errors, and control failures seriously affect the performance of HVAC systems [170]. Due to the complexity and lifespan of HVAC systems, they often encounter various malfunctions and problems, such as refrigerant leaks, valve failures, and circuit problems. Traditional HVAC fault detection methods often rely on the experience and intuition of professional technicians, which has many limitations, such as low detection efficiency, unstable detection results, and high costs. Research has shown that due to building system failures and improper control, 15%\u201330% of the energy may be wasted [171]. Therefore, fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) or automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) could be crucial for ensuring reliable system operation and avoiding energy waste. As a consequence, researchers and engineers are increasingly exploring the use of machine learning algorithms to solve the problem of HVAC fault detection. Here, \u201cfault\u201d implies deviations from normal operation in at least one measurable quantity, \u201cdetection\u201d is the task of discovering the fault, and \u201cdiagnosis\u201d refers to the identification of the origin of the fault as well as its location. Model-based FDD approaches appeal to the underlying physics insofar as it can be understood, while rule-based approaches extract a list of rules for decision making on the basis of expert knowledge and known underlying physics, which will change from system to system. Machine learning approaches are more efficient and scalable; machine learning algorithms can quickly process a large volume of data, discover hidden patterns and accelerate the process of fault detection and troubleshooting. Machine learning algorithms for FDD can be adaptive, with adjustments made based on real-time data to cover different environments and situations. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms can allow for visualization, in order for engineers to analyze and make decisions regarding faults. Finally, no complex model of the system is required, making the approaches much more adaptable and eliminating the need for an accurate, validated model. This also avoids the problem of parameter value drift with time, and the computational expense of running the model. Table 3 summarizes a selection of the main machine learning studies related to FDD of HVAC systems. One of the methods by which faults can be detected is statistical process monitoring (SPM), which draws on multivariate data from the process to find anomalies, usually based on principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares. PCA is a commonly used dimensionality reduction technique for data that lie in a high-dimensional ambient space. PCA finds an approximate representation of the data in low-dimensional subspace of the ambient space. The data (typically centered by the sample mean) is orthogonally projected onto a set of principal directions, which are found by an eigenanalysis of the sample covariance matrix. The principal directions represent directions of decreasing variance in the data. The components of the data in this new basis are referred to as principal components. The data can be reduced in size by restricting to a subspace corresponding to those principal directions that capture a specified fraction of the total variance. In HVAC FDD, normal operating data is used to find the principal directions. New measurements can be projected onto a subspace defined by a specified number of the directions and the residual (difference between the projection and the actual data point) can be subjected to different statistics, such as a Q or Hotelling statistic to determine statistical significance. Movahed et al. [192] used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, accounting for 95% of the data variance. Subsequently, methods of time series anomaly detection and RF were used to reduce false positives and to account for data imbalances; the authors rightly emphasize that insufficient attention has been paid to false positives in HVAC FDD research. The method proposed by Simmini et al. [184] uses kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) in place of PCA. The motivation for nonlinear dimension reduction (manifold learning) techniques such as KPCA, Isomap, diffusion maps and local tangent space alignment is that for some data sets a linear subspace approximation (e.g., PCA or classical multidimensional scaling) is not possible to find. In such cases, nonlinear dimension reduction techniques essentially map the data to a feature space, while preserving a metric (distance) in the original space. The methods differ in how this metric is defined in the original space, while in the feature space a Euclidean metric is always used. For example, Isomap uses a geodesic distance whereas diffusion maps use a transition probability defined by identifying data points with nodes on a graph and constructing a Markov chain. An alternative, and more natural interpretation of KPCA is that linear PCA is performed in the feature space, with no explicit specification of the feature map. Instead, the eigenvalue problem in feature space can be written entirely in terms of a kernel (which is specified) and kernel substitution is employed. In HVAC fault detection and diagnosis, KPCA and related methods can help to better understand the operating status of the system and diagnose potential faults when there are highly non-linear relationships in the data that cannot be rationalized using PCA. To the best of our knowledge, only KPCA has been used in the context of HVAC systems, even though there are many other methods available, and it is difficult to know a-priori which method is best suited for a given data set. There are many questions that need to be answered in future research, including the conditions under which linear methods fail, the efficacy of nonlinear methods in such cases and comparisons between the different methods for different data types. A key aspect of machine learning algorithms is the acquisition and processing of data. Data quality is crucial for the accuracy and credibility of the final results, and labeled data is even more difficult to obtain. This is because collecting labeled data for fault conditions is time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes even dangerous. In addition, HVAC systems are often complex and dynamic, and different systems may have different characteristics and behaviors. This makes it difficult to develop a universal FDD model suitable for different HVAC systems. With the development of technology, there are increasingly more channels for data acquisition. Hosamo et al. [193] proposed a digital twin predictive maintenance framework for AHU to overcome the limitations of facility maintenance management (FMM) systems currently used in buildings. This framework is designed to predict component status, maintain or repair components in advance, and improve the service life of AHU components. The digital twin technology includes data integration and a data flow process among building information modeling, IoT sensor networks and facility manager systems. The proposed framework includes three main components, namely data acquisition, the predictive maintenance step and a BIM model, which is used for visualization and monitoring. Machine learning in the form of ANNs, SVMs, and DTs was used to classify faults, after selecting inputs using a sensitivity analysis. Bezyan et al. [194] used normal operating data to build models for two key temperature sensors relating to an AHU, both models based on SVR and using various temperature and flow rate values as inputs. These models were used to predict the expected values of temperature, which were compared to measured values to detect anomalies on the basis of the residuals or differences. Separate RNN models were used to predict whether each of the inputs was anomalous, rather than, or in addition to the temperature output. Once all anomalies were found, a rule-based method was used to detect a fault. Although data is available via multiple channels and can be used for FDD as in Ref. [193], high-quality data sets are usually expensive and difficult to obtain, and it is even more difficult to label the obtained data, which requires in-depth understanding of HVAC system behavior and thermodynamic principles. Moreover, there are issues associated with unbalanced data sets, meaning the target classes have an uneven number of examples. Albayati et al. [189] developed a semi-supervised learning approach by first using clustering to group faults, followed by locating the k unlabeled nearest neighbors to a given set of labelled training points (Euclidean distance based). They then labelled these points according to which training point was closest, while restricting the search for neighbors such that they fell within the same cluster. In this way, the size of the training set for fault classification was increased and the problem of imbalanced data addressed, leading to greater accuracy. They applied the method to a HVAC system in an industrial facility in Connecticut, using SVM for classification, with up to 95.7% accuracy. Another way to improve results by augmenting a data set is to use transfer learning, leveraging knowledge from other HVAC systems. Fan et al. [191] proposed a new image-based transfer learning framework to solve the challenges of multi-source data compatibility in the field of architecture, and discussed the value of transfer learning in cross domain FDD tasks. They effectively integrated table data from different building systems, proposing a two-dimensional image conversion method that converts table data into two-dimensional images, followed by the extraction of features for knowledge transfer using CNNs. Various transfer learning strategies were then adopted to migrate knowledge from the source to target task (system). The accuracy was found to increase from between 2.4% and 22.2%, depending on the volume of training data available; namely, the lower the volume of data the higher the accuracy gain, for obvious reasons. This suggests that transfer learning is only valuable (given its associated time costs) when limited data is available for the target task. Viol et al. [190] pointed out that most of the research on transfer learning for HVAC systems has focused on learning algorithms, ignoring the importance of appropriate domain similarity analyses of the available data. Their main contribution is the application of a pre-training filter that discards dissimilar samples. Seven feature-based and instance-based transfer learning approaches were tested, and the results on AHU system data revealed that negative transfer is a serious issue (the results deteriorate with transfer learning). In some cases the filter able to offset this issue, in one particular case raising the F score from 0.29 to 0.9. These results are preliminary, however, and more research into these phenomena, including the detailed inter-relationships between the transfer learning method, the volume of data, and the dissimilarity of the data sets, is required. Aside from the aforementioned methods, a wide variety of other machine learning algorithms have been applied to FDD of HVAC systems, such as deep belief networks [185], Bayesian network classifiers [182,183], and generative adversarial networks [187]. The application of machine learning in this area can help to better understand the operating status of systems and diagnose potential faults, improve system efficiency and reliability, and reduce costs and risks. When applying machine learning, special attention needs to be paid to the quality and quantity of data, as well as the selection and tuning of models. In addition, the various methods can be used within a semi-supervised framework and alongside transfer learning to further improve their accuracy and reliability by incorporating more data, and allowing for imbalanced and missing data, which is the usual scenario in real-world applications. 4 Future research directions and conclusions HVAC systems account for more than 40% of building energy consumption, and are one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Machine learning methods could have a transformative impact on the optimization and control of HVAC systems, as well as on building design and fault diagnosis and detection. Despite over a decade of research into this area, however, it is fair to say that there are few practical examples of their adoption. The selection of appropriate machine-learning methods depends on several factors, such as the application, the data type, data quantity and quality, calculation cost and calculation complexity. At present, the machine learning methods used in HVAC system optimization are mainly supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Many studies, however, adopt a mixed approach, combining these methods with unsupervised methods (clustering, dimension reduction), and/or within semi-supervised and transfer learning approaches. The sheer complexity of HVAC optimal control problems, involving dynamic thermal and occupancy models, large and complex data sets, electricity pricing, and a complex multi-objective constrained optimization would suggest a complex solution, drawing upon various different techniques to form submodels with various options to facilitate transferability. It could also be that such a transferability is not possible, at least not when the applications are vastly different in type and scale. DNN approaches have becomes widely used, and perhaps overused in recent years. DNNs are extremely powerful and versatile, capable of high accuracy, applicable to supervised (classification and regression) tasks, unsupervised tasks such as feature extraction and time series or sequence problems using RNNs. Convolutional or dense layers can be used to extract features for improved classification, especially when the data set is not linearly separable. On the other hand, they have a number of shortcomings, such as the extremely large number of parameters and associated danger of overfitting, the difficulty in obtaining stable solutions (high model variance), the difficulty in finding optimal architectures given the vastness of the search space, and the times taken to design and validate DNNs. Much more comparisons are required to other equivalent approaches such as GP models, SVM/SVR, and kernel regression to determine under which conditions they perform better. Another vital aspect for which DNNs, notably RNNs, have been used is the dynamic modelling of buildings, e.g., occupancy and load prediction. While RNNs are unrivalled in natural language processing, namely predicting words in a sequence, they are generally not favored in time-series analysis. The main issues are their complexity, lack of explainability, and absence of confidence intervals. Alternatives such as hidden Markov models have already been explored for HVAC systems. However, there are many other linear and nonlinear state-space methods that could provide better predictions than RNNs, and these have yet to be considered or compared in the HVAC literature. DRL is widely used in HVAC optimal control, combining the benefits of RL with the power of deep learning. However, it is fair to say that the various competing methods, especially DRL, MPC and robust MPC, rule-based methods and mixed methods such as nonlinear dynamics and MPC have not been systematically compared in the literature. The vast majority of studies provide very few comparisons. At the present time, therefore, it is not possible to say which of these approaches would work best for a particular type of system. It is doubtful that one approach works best for all conditions, and the performance of each for different types and volumes of data, different systems, and different objectives requires exploration. The two most important factors in the optimization of HVAC systems are energy savings and user comfort. In terms of energy conservation, most studies do not consider electricity prices or distributed and smart grids. The price of electricity fluctuates, with the peak period of HVAC use often coinciding with the period of peak electricity price. Considering electricity price in the optimization process can further reduce costs, and should therefore feature more prominently. Comfort includes four aspects: thermal comfort, air quality, noise and visual factors. At present, HVAC optimization mainly focuses on thermal comfort, and some studies consider air quality, such as carbon dioxide concentration, while very few have considered noise and visual factors. Air quality and noise should be incorporated more often, especially in high-occupancy and specialized settings such as educational buildings, offices, libraries and museums. In terms of user thermal comfort, thermal insulation and metabolic rate are parameters that are difficult to accurately measure at present, and need to be further studied. In addition, most studies do not consider the occupancy rate and residents' activities. Models for occupancy rate and activity are a major avenue for further investigation given the importance of these factors in devising accurate and reliable control policies. In the literature reviewed in this paper, many of the methods were verified by simulation, lacking real-world experiments. Simulated environments are simplifications of the real world, and while they may act as a reference they should not be used alone for the purposes of validation. A final challenge relates to the development of the Internet of Things, and the attendant improvements in data acquisition. Using this raw data is not feasible, not only due to its size but also the redundancy of information that it will contain. How to preprocess and mine this data (filter and de-noise, extract features, reduce the size, etc.) is a major challenge, for which machine learning and more broadly data science is ideally suited.

Introduction A company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning, management, and control are among the main activities of corporate management [1]. Finding innovative responses to changing environmental conditions and thus contributing to continuous improvement has proven vital to successful companies [2]. An essential prerequisite for continuous performance improvement is the awareness of one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, thus making performance monitoring a critical provision for achieving continuous improvement, facilitating the identification and application of suitable measures [3]. Managers must make hundreds of decisions daily, relying on the support of appropriate information and aligned with a common goal [4]. In order to be competitive in the long term, companies need to be able to recognize changes at an early stage and react to them proactively [3]. Performance management systems (PMS) have been developed to tackle this challenge. Aiming for the management of process performance, goals are set by the management and translated into trackable key performance indicators (KPIs) [5]. In this context, the timeliness of information plays a decisive role in the success of responding to deviations since delayed information availability can leave decision-makers with no time to react. Usually, KPIs are formed only by shift or day, which makes the real-time reaction to deviations impossible [6]. Closing this gap, a model-based approach for online-intraday predictions of KPIs using sensor and machine data is being proposed. The structure of this paper is as follows: In the second chapter, an overview of current research on performance management and the use of machine learning in production is presented. Chapter three constitutes the core of the paper, in which two different studies are conducted and evaluated on a real-world industrial 56th CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems, CIRP CMS \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc23, South Africa Intraday forecasting of OEE through sensor data and machine learning Lukas Longarda,*, Thorben Preina, Joachim Metternicha aInstitute of Production Management, Technology and Machine tools (PTW), TU Darmstadt, Otto-Berndt-Str. 2, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany * Corresponding author. E-mail address: l.longard@ptw.tu-darmstadt.de Abstract Key performance indicators are crucial for measuring and managing the performance of industrial processes. They are employed to detect deviations in production, enabling opportunities to improve manufacturing processes within the three dimensions of time, quality, and cost. In this context, the timeliness of information plays a decisive role in the success of measures since delayed information availability can leave decision-makers with no time to react. Usually, key performance indicators are updated on a shift or daily basis and thus only allow a delayed reaction to deviations that have occurred. To tackle this problem, different mixed data sampling and machine learning methods for the intraday monitoring of key performance indicators based on high-frequency sensor and machine data are investigated. By benchmarking the approaches on real-world data from the process industry, the authors show how to obtain models for real-time detection of performance deviations. To enable application for practitioners and academia in the future, a method for implementation and deployment in real-world scenarios is given. The developed methodology offers the construction of high-frequency forecasts for key performance metrics, and therefore accelerates managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reactions to associated problems. 94 Lukas Longard et al. / Procedia CIRP 120 (2023) 93\u00e2\u20ac\u201c98 Longard et al./ Procedia CIRP 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 3 3.1. Case description and data set The approach is being developed by investigating real- world data originating from a continuous extrusion process in the plastics industry. The production consists of several downstream processes, including extrusion, funneling, sieving, and melting. Consecutively the melted semi-finished product is cast and rolled. The dataset used in this study contains three major parts. The first one is a time series of about 600 sensors, which was limited to 0.1 Hz for the pursued use case to save memory. Secondly, the MES data assigns specific machine states, such as replenishment and production, to time intervals of the sensor data. Lastly, the dataset covers the KPI data, such as employee documented good and scrap quantity, for the examined period. The performance of the process is measured by the OEE, consisting of its three components: availability rate, performance rate and quality rate (see formula 1-4 and Figure 2). In total, the available data covers nine months without interruptions.

aim of the approach to be developed is to predict the OEE and its components (availability rate, performance rate and quality rate) as accurately as possible. It can be assumed that individual components can be predicted better and others worse on the basis of the sensor and machine data. In order to realize a detailed evaluation, a separate model is trained for each KPI, predicting the individual constituents (see Table 1). The evaluation starts with the prediction of the leading KPI, the OEE, which is then split into its three components and later broken down into their constituents. Based on the results of the individual models, a statement on the information content of the sensor data and feasibility of our approach can be derived. 3.2. Preliminary study Forecasting a processes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performance by utilizing machine- based sensor data bears major challenges. Reported earlier in current production environments KPI data is documented only once per day. While fostering the necessity to predict KPI data with higher time resolution intra-day, this leaves machine learning approaches with very sparse gold label data to learn from. Because of this lack of gold data, the simplified problem of predicting the daily key performance values is first being investigated in a preliminary study (see Figure 4). Let \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039 be the high frequency sensor data and \u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122 be the low frequency daily target variables constituting performance metrics, such as active and set-up time, a model is being searched for a (with model parameters \u00f0\ufffd\u0153\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u0153\u0192) to map: Our approach is visualized in Figure 3. Applying the tsfresh framework, statistical features (e.g. min, max, mean, frequencies and autocorrelations) from the daily time-series sensor data are being derived [22]. In a consecutive step, the features\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 significance on the target is evaluated via hypothesis testing, keeping only the most relevant information. The tests used include the two-sided univariate fisher test, the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and Kendall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tau. By condensing the time series data to one value per feature, the originally high frequency sensor data is reduced to the daily KPI label frequency. The derived features are then fed as input data into state-of-the-art regression algorithms such as decision trees, feed forward neural networks (FFNN) and support vector machine (SVM) regressors to compare their performance. The model training and comparison is conducted by splitting the dataset into train, development, and test sets, distributing the recorded days randomly between the datasets. Accordingly, feature selection through hypothesis testing focusses on training data only. The number of most relevant features, as well as respective model hyperparameters are optimized on the validation dataset to determine an optimal model configuration. Hyperparameters include the number of most significant features used for modelling. Likewise, the number of final features used varies between the different KPIs, with a preference for most models from 100 up to 250 features. \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192(\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039, \u00f0\ufffd\u203a\u00a9\u00f0\ufffd\u203a\u00a9) = \u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122 (5) hroughput Active Po er Current Figure 3: Model pipeline for the derivation of key performance predicting models from high dimensional sensor data Figure 2: Visualization of OEE data data set. In a preliminary study, a model to predict daily KPIs based on high-frequency sensor and machine data is being developed.

Finally, the paper concludes with a short summary and an outlook for future work. 2. Literature survey 2.1. Performance management Performance management is defined as a continuous process to identify, measure, and develop the performance of individuals and teams and to align performance with the organization's strategic goals. It helps executives achieve strategic business goals by linking the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals to the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [7]. Contemporaneously over time, the concept of performance has evolved. The original dimensions of efficiency and effectiveness have been supplemented by productivity, flexibility, creativity, sustainability, and agility, influencing each other and having competing or complementary relationships [3]. In practical applications, KPIs are formed to measure and monitor these different performance dimensions, breaking them down to individual areas and teams [8]. KPIs are used to communicate information in aggregated form, counteracting knowledge deficits on the part of the decision-makers. These deficits result from the high control complexity of large production companies [9]. In addition, KPIs enable the identification of deviations by comparing actual and target values. Identified deviations can then be eliminated through systematic problem-solving processes, leading to continuous improvement and, hence, a company's long-term competitiveness [10]. The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) [11] is one of the most critical KPIs in the equipment-intensive sector [12]. It is used to determine, monitor, and improve the effectiveness of production equipment (machines, production cells, assembly lines) in the context of the manufacturing process. It comprises three components: availability rate, performance rate, and quality rate. These in turn reflect the losses over time in the dimensions of availability, performance, and quality (see Figure 1). In this context, the availability rate shows losses due to technical breakdowns, changeovers, and adjustments to the equipment. In contrast, the performance rate reveals losses due to engine idle, minor stoppages and reduced speed. The last factor the quality rate reflects losses due to defective or reworked parts. 2.2. Recent advances in performance management Recent developments in performance management incorporate the increasing availability of data and new algorithms. While companies used to compute their KPIs manually years ago, automatic calculation via IoT systems is increasingly becoming state-of-the-art [13]. The analysis of anomalies and deviations in KPIs is a central component in PMS to identify causes of deterioration and negative trends at an early stage [14]. One particularly recent development is the model-based analysis and detection of these KPI trends by leveraging machine learning techniques [15]. Xu et al. introduced an unsupervised variational autoencoder, to robustly detect deviations in seasonally varying KPIs [16]. Instead of identifying abnormal or negative trends in current timeseries, another approach is the forecasting of KPIs to estimate future performance over defined periods of time. Researchers have explored this possibility by employing machine learning techniques, such as reconstructions with semi-supervised gated autoencoders [17], partial least squares regression [18], Bayesian neural networks [19] and decision trees [20]. Expanding on the previous two KPI analysis methods are soft sensing techniques. KPI soft sensing models derive KPI values of interest, which are not monitored by a sensor directly. Instead, the current KPI status is predicted by a model processing raw input data, e.g., machine sensor outputs. The derived KPI values of interest support proactive action in PMS by increasing situational awareness and supporting informed corrective measures to meet performance goals [17,21]. This work focuses on the latter approach by developing a near real-time soft sensor that processes raw machine sensor data and predicts the strategic production KPIs of time, quality and cost. It thereby enables high frequency status monitoring. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents a novel application for soft sensing of KPIs in production environments. 3. Model development The evaluation cycles in classic performance management are carried out on a shift or daily basis. This means that key figures are formed based on the results of the previous day/shift and provide an overview of past performance in aggregated form. Consequently, measures in response to deficient performance can only be taken after a delay impacting subsequent days. This issue is being addressed by introducing an approach that uses process and machine data to provide near real-time performance information, improving management situational awareness and enabling direct measure escalation. The following research questions need to be answered: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Is there a quantifiable relationship between production performance indicators (daily) and high frequency sensor and machine data of the same day? \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 If there is a relationship: How can this relationship be used to realize intraday performance prediction for soft sensing?

Case description and data set The approach is being developed by investigating real- world data originating from a continuous extrusion process in the plastics industry. The production consists of several downstream processes, including extrusion, funneling, sieving, and melting. Consecutively the melted semi-finished product is cast and rolled. The dataset used in this study contains three major parts. The first one is a time series of about 600 sensors, which was limited to 0.1 Hz for the pursued use case to save memory. Secondly, the MES data assigns specific machine states, such as replenishment and production, to time intervals of the sensor data. Lastly, the dataset covers the KPI data, such as employee documented good and scrap quantity, for the examined period. The performance of the process is measured by the OEE, consisting of its three components: availability rate, performance rate and quality rate (see formula 1-4 and Figure 2). In total, the available data covers nine months without interruptions.

aim of the approach to be developed is to predict the OEE and its components (availability rate, performance rate and quality rate) as accurately as possible. It can be assumed that individual components can be predicted better and others worse on the basis of the sensor and machine data. In order to realize a detailed evaluation, a separate model is trained for each KPI, predicting the individual constituents (see Table 1). The evaluation starts with the prediction of the leading KPI, the OEE, which is then split into its three components and later broken down into their constituents. Based on the results of the individual models, a statement on the information content of the sensor data and feasibility of our approach can be derived. 3.2. Preliminary study Forecasting a processes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performance by utilizing machine- based sensor data bears major challenges. Reported earlier in current production environments KPI data is documented only once per day. While fostering the necessity to predict KPI data with higher time resolution intra-day, this leaves machine learning approaches with very sparse gold label data to learn from. Because of this lack of gold data, the simplified problem of predicting the daily key performance values is first being investigated in a preliminary study (see Figure 4). Let \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039 be the high frequency sensor data and \u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122 be the low frequency daily target variables constituting performance metrics, such as active and set-up time, a model is being searched for a (with model parameters \u00f0\ufffd\u0153\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u0153\u0192) to map: Our approach is visualized in Figure 3. Applying the tsfresh framework, statistical features (e.g. min, max, mean, frequencies and autocorrelations) from the daily time-series sensor data are being derived [22]. In a consecutive step, the features\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 significance on the target is evaluated via hypothesis testing, keeping only the most relevant information. The tests used include the two-sided univariate fisher test, the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and Kendall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tau. By condensing the time series data to one value per feature, the originally high frequency sensor data is reduced to the daily KPI label frequency. The derived features are then fed as input data into state-of-the-art regression algorithms such as decision trees, feed forward neural networks (FFNN) and support vector machine (SVM) regressors to compare their performance. The model training and comparison is conducted by splitting the dataset into train, development, and test sets, distributing the recorded days randomly between the datasets. Accordingly, feature selection through hypothesis testing focusses on training data only. The number of most relevant features, as well as respective model hyperparameters are optimized on the validation dataset to determine an optimal model configuration. Hyperparameters include the number of most significant features used for modelling. Likewise, the number of final features used varies between the different KPIs, with a preference for most models from 100 up to 250 features. \u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u0192(\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2039, \u00f0\ufffd\u203a\u00a9\u00f0\ufffd\u203a\u00a9) = \u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\ufffd\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122\u00f0\ufffd\u2018\u2122 (5) hroughput Active Po er Current Figure 3: Model pipeline for the derivation of key performance predicting models from high dimensional sensor data Figure 2: Visualization of OEE data 2 Longard et al. / Procedia CIRP 00 (2023) 000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c000 data set. In a preliminary study, a model to predict daily KPIs based on high-frequency sensor and machine data is being developed. Based on the results of the preliminary study, the main study is then conducted and a model for real-time availability rate prediction is presented. Finally, the paper concludes with a short summary and an outlook for future work. 2. Literature survey 2.1. Performance management Performance management is defined as a continuous process to identify, measure, and develop the performance of individuals and teams and to align performance with the organization's strategic goals. It helps executives achieve strategic business goals by linking the business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals to the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [7]. Contemporaneously over time, the concept of performance has evolved. The original dimensions of efficiency and effectiveness have been supplemented by productivity, flexibility, creativity, sustainability, and agility, influencing each other and having competing or complementary relationships [3]. In practical applications, KPIs are formed to measure and monitor these different performance dimensions, breaking them down to individual areas and teams [8]. KPIs are used to communicate information in aggregated form, counteracting knowledge deficits on the part of the decision-makers. These deficits result from the high control complexity of large production companies [9]. In addition, KPIs enable the identification of deviations by comparing actual and target values. Identified deviations can then be eliminated through systematic problem-solving processes, leading to continuous improvement and, hence, a company's long-term competitiveness [10]. The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) [11] is one of the most critical KPIs in the equipment-intensive sector [12]. It is used to determine, monitor, and improve the effectiveness of production equipment (machines, production cells, assembly lines) in the context of the manufacturing process. It comprises three components: availability rate, performance rate, and quality rate. These in turn reflect the losses over time in the dimensions of availability, performance, and quality (see Figure 1). In this context, the availability rate shows losses due to technical breakdowns, changeovers, and adjustments to the equipment. In contrast, the performance rate reveals losses due to engine idle, minor stoppages and reduced speed. The last factor the quality rate reflects losses due to defective or reworked parts. 2.2. Recent advances in performance management Recent developments in performance management incorporate the increasing availability of data and new algorithms. While companies used to compute their KPIs manually years ago, automatic calculation via IoT systems is increasingly becoming state-of-the-art [13]. The analysis of anomalies and deviations in KPIs is a central component in PMS to identify causes of deterioration and negative trends at an early stage [14]. One particularly recent development is the model-based analysis and detection of these KPI trends by leveraging machine learning techniques [15]. Xu et al. introduced an unsupervised variational autoencoder, to robustly detect deviations in seasonally varying KPIs [16]. Instead of identifying abnormal or negative trends in current timeseries, another approach is the forecasting of KPIs to estimate future performance over defined periods of time. Researchers have explored this possibility by employing machine learning techniques, such as reconstructions with semi-supervised gated autoencoders [17], partial least squares regression [18], Bayesian neural networks [19] and decision trees [20]. Expanding on the previous two KPI analysis methods are soft sensing techniques. KPI soft sensing models derive KPI values of interest, which are not monitored by a sensor directly. Instead, the current KPI status is predicted by a model processing raw input data, e.g., machine sensor outputs. The derived KPI values of interest support proactive action in PMS by increasing situational awareness and supporting informed corrective measures to meet performance goals [17,21]. This work focuses on the latter approach by developing a near real-time soft sensor that processes raw machine sensor data and predicts the strategic production KPIs of time, quality and cost. It thereby enables high frequency status monitoring. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents a novel application for soft sensing of KPIs in production environments. 3. Model development The evaluation cycles in classic performance management are carried out on a shift or daily basis. This means that key figures are formed based on the results of the previous day/shift and provide an overview of past performance in aggregated form. Consequently, measures in response to deficient performance can only be taken after a delay impacting subsequent days. This issue is being addressed by introducing an approach that uses process and machine data to provide near real-time performance information, improving management situational awareness and enabling direct measure escalation. The following research questions need to be answered: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Is there a quantifiable relationship between production performance indicators (daily) and high frequency sensor and machine data of the same day? \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 If there is a relationship: How can this relationship be used to realize intraday performance prediction for soft sensing?

Thus, the new densely labelled dataset contains time dependent labels accurate to minutes. Following the additional data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nature of providing additional gold labels for the time usage only and the results of the preliminary study, the availability rate is being focused on. Consecutively, a decision tree classification model is being trained to predict the machines state for each incremental time interval. Finally, by investigating the different machine states for a given day under investigation, it is possible to compute the current key performance constituents for active and set-up time. Obtaining a high accuracy for the time increment classification, the approach highlights the possibility to derive the system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key performance from the machine data only. Aggregating the predicted states for time increments across a day, the daily predicted key performance can be compared against the dataset documented performance values, reducing RMSE prediction error to only 1.1% for active time and 0.7% for set-up time (see Table 2). Furthermore, it might be possible to obtain even higher values, by further increasing the resolution of the MES data derived condition labels. Table 2: Main study - results for normalized RMSE values and corresponding R\u00c2\u00b2 values RMSE Active time .011 .998 Set-up time .007 .930 Downtime .029 .980 The new classifier can be used to monitor the system under operation, providing immediate feedback on the real-time status of the system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s KPI values. By predicting the machine status, the individual components of the availability rate (e.g. active time, set-up time and downtime) can be determined in real time, by summing up the corresponding predicted times. Thus, the availability rate can be calculated at any time and allows real-time assessment of the current performance. The good results for the densely labelled task emphasize the importance of the additional time resolved label data, considering the substantial improvement regarding the preliminary studies predictions. Targeting a similar increase in label density, future developments should focus on the other system KPIs to achieve a complete soft sensor-based monitoring for the investigated continuous process. The accuracy reached for the latter models are sufficient for an operationalization and use on the shop floor. The model can enable employees and managers to obtain information on the current performance of a production line/area at any time to derive suitable measures. Reducing reaction times significantly when compared to the current status quo with evaluation of KPIs at the end of the day. Aiming for a comprehensible presentation of the newly derived information to employees and managers, a dashboard is presented (see Figure 6), which provides the information concisely and clearly. The dashboard is divided into two graphs. The upper graph visualizes the current availability rate forecast for the end of the day or shift. Here, the prediction starts at the beginning of the shift with an average expectation for the availability rate (in example 80%) and then rises and falls during the day depending on actual performance (left side of figure). A prediction interval for the availability rate is calculated and displayed for the remaining production time (right side of the figure). The lower graph visualizes the current status of the Figure 6: Dashboard design for real-time monitoring of availability rate Real time 2 3 Forecast ast 3 min ast 2h Performance The results (see Table 1) indicate a general agreement between the different algorithms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performances. Prevalent, the best results are achieved for the key performance values of active time, good quantity and downtime. The goodness of the prediction can be determined by relating the RMSE with the Na\u00c3\u00afve models results and investigating the R2 values. Evaluating the model generated features shows that among many others, the model leverages a correlation between the aftercooling roll utilization and temperature control to the nozzle for predicting the respective active times. However, the results also show the difficulty of regressing accurate key performance metrics using the sparse daily labels for all predicted key performance quantities.

Considering the different performance metrics, the best results are achieved for the time of active usage and the production volume of the machine. Overall, the approach highlights the challenges and limitations for the derivation of a KPI soft sensor using the high dimensional sensor data with sparse, daily labels only (see Figure 5). However, it points into further directions, by showing the possibility of predicting especially availability rate related key performance components. It can be concluded that the insufficient accuracy for the derivation of quality and performance related predictions is being caused by the more complex relations hidden in patterns of the heating and thickness control system, however due to the scarce low frequency training data those can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be approximated for the continuous high throughput process. Meanwhile the operation time itself, as well as maintenance procedures are easier to relate, as those states can be directly represented in the procedure affected machine sensors. Furthermore, additional error is caused by human documentation of the KPI values\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 development, manually calculated and partially approximated after shifts. 3.3. Main study In the main study it is further investigated how the previous findings can lead towards a real-time OEE prediction and soft sensing. As discussed, data scarcity has been identified to be a major bottleneck. To overcome the preliminary studies models\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 limitations, e increase the dataset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labels by augmenting the human documented KPI values with MES data. This way, we overcome the limitation of the preliminary study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s models, which could only be used for soft sensing KPIs after the end of a working day. Instead, we derive features on equidistant periods of time, splitting each day into 144 ten-minute lasting timesteps. Leveraging the additional data, a new modeling approach is developed in the following. The approach enables the real-time prediction of the respective KPI and examines if better predictions are possible through the higher label density on the already high-frequency sensor data.

To the minute, it shows whether the line has been producing (in green), has been set up (in grey), or has had a malfunction (in red). In addition, the performance of the last 30 min and the last 2 h is shown and thus a positive or negative development can be derived. 4. Conclusion In this work, the necessity to improve current key performance monitoring to be timelier and therefore allow for quicker reactions to deviations during daily operation is being highlighted. It is being investigated how a timelier assessment and display of KPI values can be realized with respect to a real- world extrusion process from the plastics industry. It is being found that the prediction of key performance related metrics using only sparse daily labels imposes a challenging problem and while for the investigated process the prediction of some KPIs has been achieved with reasonable accuracy, our results show that real-time resolved KPI monitoring cannot be accomplished. Instead, a second experiment shows that more information dense labelling enriches the developed models\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capabilities and can be used to predict real-time KPI development. Showing results for availability rate only, future research should focus on the adaptation of this approach to other KPI values, potentially necessitating a period of on-site data acquisition. Finally, after the development of a real-time capable model an interactive dashboard to reinforce management personnel on current KPI status is being presented. Allowing for a fast and intuitive overview, the dashboard summarizes recent developments under the KPI computation for the last thirty minutes, as well as medium and all-day performance reviews.

They are employed to detect deviations in production, enabling opportunities to improve manufacturing processes within the three dimensions of time, quality, and cost. In this context, the timeliness of information plays a decisive role in the success of measures since delayed information availability can leave decision-makers with no time to react. Usually, key performance indicators are updated on a shift or daily basis and thus only allow a delayed reaction to deviations that have occurred. To tackle this problem, different mixed data sampling and machine learning methods for the intraday monitoring of key performance indicators based on high-frequency sensor and machine data are investigated. By benchmarking the approaches on real-world data from the process industry, the authors show how to obtain models for real-time detection of performance deviations. To enable application for practitioners and academia in the future, a method for implementation and deployment in real-world scenarios is given. The developed methodology offers the construction of high-frequency forecasts for key performance metrics, and therefore accelerates managers\u2019 reactions to associated problems.

ML Intention Object Data sources Characteristics Major results Ref HCA A Hop pellets NIR, MIR Both are rapid, non-destructive, low-cost, but MIR has a higher specificity than NIR Based on NIR and MIR data, hop pellets were divided into two clusters, but the distribution of MIR-HCA was not as clear as NIR (Machado et al., 2018) B Black pepper UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS, 1H NMR, GC-HRMS High-throughput analysis, high sensitivity, and high resolution, and NMR-UHPLC-GC data fusion approach can reduce the dimensionality of 1H NMR and improve accuracy Based on UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS HCA model, the clustering of samples from Brazil and Vietnam was close, and the clustering of sterilized samples and corresponding unsterilized samples was also very close (Rivera-Perez et al., 2021) C Rhizoma Coptidis HPLC, FT-NIR, FT-IR Spectra can not only can it be used for qualitative analysis, but it can also assist in quantitative analysis; Data fusion can obtain more comprehensive chemical information Based on FT-NIR, when the distance was 23, the samples of C.omeiensis and C.chinensis are clustered into one class, and the distance was 24, which involves C.deltoidea samples; Based on FT-IR, C. deltoidea and C. teeta samples are clustered into one class; Based on data fusion, C. deltoidea, C. chinensis and C. teeta samples are clustered into one class when the distance was 12 (Qi et al., 2018) PCA A Oolong tea Gustatory sensors, olfactory sensors Sensor technology is fast and accurate, and can make non-specific reactions to relevant chemical components, but only a single sensor technology cannot fully characterize samples PCA was established based on taste sensor data and olfactory sensor data respectively, and the two showed similar results.

The quality and safety of edible crops are key links inseparable from human health and nutrition. In the era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, using it to mine multi-source information on edible crops provides new opportunities for industrial development and market supervision of edible crops. This review comprehensively summarized the applications of multi-source data combined with machine learning in the quality evaluation of edible crops. Multi-source data can provide more comprehensive and rich information from a single data source, as it can integrate different data information. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning is applied to data analysis to achieve different requirements for the quality evaluation of edible crops. Emphasized the advantages and disadvantages of techniques and analysis methods, the problems that need to be overcome, and promising development directions were proposed.

A series of active ingredients contained in edible crops are the basis for ensuring their quality and are closely related to human health and nutrition (Wen et al., 2018). The world\u2019s demand for edible crops has been rising, but their quality and yield are affected by the natural environment and social factors (Delpeuch & Leblois, 2014; Su et al., 2016). To maximize the benefits obtained, the edible crop industry has fallen into a crisis of trust, which has greatly consumed consumer confidence. Consumers tend to consume edible crops that have positive effects on metabolic activities. In order to increase the competitiveness of market consumption, it is imperative to certify and control the quality of edible crops (Wen et al., 2018). However, the evaluation indicators of edible crops are increasingly inclined to be multi-component, and it is difficult to achieve quality evaluation because only a single analysis technology cannot fully characterize its active components (He & Zhou, 2021). There are two main sources of multi-source data for edible crops: One uses the same data platform to analyze different biological entities; the other uses different data platforms to analyze the same biological entity (Stavropoulos et al., 2021). Multi-source data can reflect more comprehensive information compared to a single data source. Due to the complexity and diversity of the chemical components of edible crops, it is necessary to fully characterize them with multi-source data (Pei et al., 2020). Data fusion is typically used as a method to deal with imperfect raw data. Integrating multi-source data through a data fusion strategy can reveal a variety of reliable and accurate feature information and obtain better decision-making, prediction, and classification results (Zhang et al., 2022). And it has significant advantages over single analytical technology, enabling higher precision and predictive accuracy. For example, active ingredients with low content can be detected through data fusion, and the detection range is more extensive than that of a single analytical technique (Li et al., 2021). Nowadays, data fusion has been more and more applied to civilian applications. However, because its data come from multiple complementary sources, it has led to cumbersome experiments and increased computation costs (Zhou et al., 2022). Only by using data mining can the target information in multi-source data be identified more quickly and accurately (He & Zhou, 2021). Machine learning is one of the powerful tools for data mining, which can extract meaningful information from a large amount of data (Salcedo-Sanz et al., 2020). Machine learning imitates human recognition ability and provides reliable solutions to problems through computation (Greener et al., 2022). Because of its robust estimation and prediction ability, it can compensate for the lack of data fusion, and combining the two significantly improves the ability to process multi-source data (Meng et al., 2020). The multi-source data of edible crops often contain too much complex feature information, and the dataset is also relatively large, machine learning has significant advantages in dealing with such problems, which can effectively shorten the data analysis time (Greener et al., 2022). Therefore, the purpose of this review is to comprehensively summarize the research status of multi-source data combined with machine learning in edible crop quality evaluation in the past decade. It briefly introduced multi-source data types, machine learning, and their strengths and weaknesses. It has clarified the significance of using data fusion strategies to process multi-source data and the differences between different data fusion strategies. The applicability of different data combinations and models in the quality evaluation of edible crops was discussed in depth. Further analysis of the limitations of existing evaluation methods and prospects for future research directions. Fig. 1 showed the application of multi-source data/data fusion strategy combined with machine learning in edible crops. 2 Multi-source data of edible crops 2.1 Modern analytical technique Some studies, such as edible crops fraud, showed that traditional methods had been gradually replaced by modern analytical techniques, including spectroscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and electronic sensor system (Liu et al., 2022b). As one of the sources of multi-source data on edible crops, these five analytical techniques provide a scientific basis for their quality evaluation. The following sections would briefly introduce each of the aforementioned analytical techniques. 2.1.1 Spectroscopic techniques With the pursuit of green environmental protection, spectroscopy has been increasingly used in the research of edible crops. Different spectroscopic techniques can obtain information on different functional groups, and combining different spectral information is helpful to comprehensively study the overall chemical profile of edible crops. Ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectroscopy, as an electronic spectroscopy technique, is able to absorb ultraviolet radiation to cause energy level transition of electrons, thereby providing the information of different chromophores such as carboxyl groups, double bonds, triple bonds, and conjugated double bonds, etc. in the wavelength range of 200\u2013780 nm (Rajput et al., 2022; W\u0142odarska et al., 2021; Zaroual et al., 2022). One of the most popular green chemical t techniques is infrared (IR) spectra, which can be divided into three sub-regions: far-infrared region, mid-infrared (MIR) region, and near-infrared (NIR) region. The chemical ingredients and related compounds of the analyte can be detected by the energy provided by the molecular bond movement (such as vibration) and the energy absorbed when the mid-infrared light irradiates the analyte (De Marchi et al., 2014). In order to solve the problems of low resolution and slow speed of MIR spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy makes up for the lack of MIR spectra, and is widely used because of its wide detection spectral range and high resolution (Chen et al., 2022). Similar to the principle of MIR spectra, the signal of NIR spectra is closely related to molecular vibrations, especially with overtones and combinations of fundamental vibrations (Abbas et al., 2018). The absorption of electromagnetic radiation is the basis for the formation of the NIR spectrum, and the use of different measurement modes of the NIR instrument is able to capture the NIR radiation that interacts with the samples (Shafiee & Minaei, 2018). Every edible crop possesses its unique fingerprint in the NIR spectrum, so combining machine learning with NIR spectra is necessary for quality control (Oliveira et al., 2019). Raman spectroscopy is also an emerging molecular vibrational spectroscopy technique. On the basis of inelastic scattering that occurs between photons and molecules, there are two types of Raman scattering: Stokes and the other is anti-Stokes shifts (Allakhverdiev et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022). Compared with vibrational spectroscopy, the hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique can obtain relevant spectral features and provide spatial information to generate hyperspectral images of samples at different wavelengths (Peng et al., 2022). Nevertheless, atomic spectroscopy mainly provides information about the internal structure of atoms. In the analysis of edible crops, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometric (ICP-OES) are two common methods used to detect elemental profiles. ICP-MS combined with machine learning is a proven strategy for identifying the geographical origin of grapes and wines in China (Gao et al., 2022). ICP-OES is a hyphenated technique that has developed rapidly in recent years and has been widely used in the analysis of edible crops (Khan et al., 2021). The traditional method needs to reserve enough knowledge and experience, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while Laser induced plasma spectroscopy (LIBS) and X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) do not require sample pretreatment, and have the advantages of fast and non-destructive (Quackatz et al., 2022). The active ingredients and nutrients in edible crops cover a wide range. Different spectroscopic techniques can represent different chemical properties, so the multi-spectral technique is usually used as a complementary source in many links, such as adulteration identification, geographical origin identification, and quality control of edible crops, and has achieved remarkable results. Spectroscopic technique plays a vital role in the quality assessment of edible crops. In addition, terahertz spectroscopy can be used to identify the physical and chemical properties of edible crops. However, its application in combination with other techniques in edible crops is very few, which is a direction with excellent development space. 2.1.2 Chromatography Chromatography can provide data with good precision and accuracy, among which gas and liquid chromatography are widely used. These two chromatography methods use the compounds\u2019 size and the stationary phase\u2019s affinity to separate and detect compounds. Both Liquid chromatography (LC) and UV can be used as means of quantitative analysis, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has the advantages of high sensitivity, high detection selectivity, and high qualitative ability over UV (Abdel Razeq et al., 2021). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a relatively common LC as a reliable method for the comprehensive evaluation of food and plant extracts, its fingerprints have high precision and resolution. Because of the increasingly stringent requirements of the experiment, the pursuit of a fast, sensitive, and specific method, and the concern of environmental impact, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) has more advantages than LC and can shorten the analysis time (Toribio et al., 2021). Gas chromatography (GC) outperforms LC in terms of theoretical plate number and cost performance (Ichihara et al., 2021). GC mainly uses the differences in the boiling point, polarity, and adsorption properties of substances to separate mixtures. It has been widely used to detect the separation, identification, and quantification of most edible crops and aroma compounds containing chemical composition, such as volatile compositions and lipids (Guo et al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2022). Solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC\u2013MS) is gradually replacing traditional analytical methods applied to the detection of aroma compositions (Arslan et al., 2022). Meanwhile, comprehensive two-dimensional GC\u2013MS (2D GC\u2013MS) is also an effective tool for analyzing complex volatile and semi-volatile compositions (Sudol et al., 2022). One of the key indicators to evaluate the economic value of edible crops is the content of active ingredients. Chromatography is a recognized quantitative analysis technique, and although some emerging techniques can serve as substitutes, its position is still unshakable. The most common way to predict the content of edible crops is to use regression models to correlate spectral and chromatographic data. At the same time, chromatography also has unique advantages in identifying adulteration of edible crops, which are highly sensitive to compounds with low concentrations. 2.1.3 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy The generation of NMR spectroscopy is based on the energy exchange between nuclei with spin quantum numbers not equal to 0, such as 1H, 1C, 1F, and alternating magnetic fields under the influence of two magnetic fields (constant magnetic field and alternating magnetic field) (Cao et al., 2021a). It is an indispensable quantitative analysis technique to obtain structural information on organic compounds. NMR combined with chemometrics enables the comprehensive characterization of complex compounds, which is beneficial for quality control and authenticity studies of edible crops (Monakhova et al., 2018). NMR is an essential tool to analyze the structure of compounds. It is mainly used for qualitative analysis in the research of edible crops, but it is rarely used at present. It is undeniable that NMR also has specific development potential in the quantitative analysis of chemical mixtures. In future edible crop research, NMR can be widely considered for use. 2.1.4 Mass spectrometry and its hyphenated techniques Mass spectrometry (MS) is hyphenated with separation techniques such as LC and GC to help take advantage of both atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) are usually used as ionization sources. GC\u2013MS is the earliest-developed chromatography-MS technique and is commonly used for the determination of complex compounds due to its high accuracy and sensitivity (Feizi et al., 2021). LC-MS is regarded as an extension of GC\u2013MS, but compared with GC\u2013MS, LC-MS is more difficult to couple due to the liquid eluent in the ion source (Famiglini et al., 2021). MS generally plays an auxiliary role in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of edible crops. It is mainly used in conjunction with techniques with separation capabilities to complement each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. With the emergence of mass spectrometry imaging, MS has a new application form in edible crops (Jiang et al., 2022). Nevertheless, only some studies have reported applying this technique to edible crops. Mass spectrometry imaging has high resolution and sensitivity while maintaining the integrity of samples, which can be used as a potential tool for the quality assessment of edible crops. 2.1.5 Electronic sensor systems Traditional sensory evaluation relies on the experience of professionals, has intense subjective color, and the evaluation results are easily affected by many factors. With the rapid development of the era of artificial intelligence, electronic sensing technique has emerged at the historical moment and gradually become a substitute for traditional analytical techniques and sensory evaluation. Three kinds of electronic sensor techniques are widely used in the quality evaluation of edible crops: Electronic nose (E-nose), electronic tongue (E-tongue), and computer vision. The design inspiration for the E-nose and E-tongue comes from the behavior pattern of mammalian recognition targets. The sensors of the E-nose and E-tongue are non-selective or semi-selective, combined in the array to output the response to the target. Another important part is the pattern recognition system, which analyzes the sensor\u2019s perception of smell or taste (Huang et al., 2019). Computer vision simulates human visual functions and comprises lighting equipment, a camera, and a personal computer. Its primary purpose is to obtain the color, shape, and texture information of the target through the camera and lighting equipment. In addition, the digital attributes of the target or imaging scene can also be collected by computer vision. The personal computer is the core part, used to analyze and process the valuable information in the image. These three sensors are mainly used for qualitative analysis and are challenging to carry out accurate quantitative analysis (Chen et al., 2015). It is worth mentioning that a single sensor still has certain defects in detection and needs to be combined with other analysis techniques to obtain more accurate data. 2.2 Data fusion 2.2.1 Pre-processing Selecting appropriate pre-processing methods according to the types and characteristics of multi-source data is necessary to improve the model\u2019s performance. Spectral or chromatographic analysis is affected by factors such as the external environment (humidity, temperature), measurement mode, and instrument during sample collection, which may easily lead to unfavorable changes such as baseline drift (Lan et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2020). For example, spectral data not only provides rich functional group information but also may introduce noise, scattering effect, and other information that is not conducive to data fusion or modeling. The existence of redundant information highlights the need for pre-processing. Common pre-processing methods include baseline correction, standard normal variate (SNV), normalization, orthogonal signal correction (OSC), multiplicative scattering correction (MSC), derivative, and Savitzky-Golay (S-G) smoothing. Compared with a single pre-processing method, different complementary information can be obtained from the combination of multiple pre-processing methods. Pre-processing ensembles with response-oriented sequential alternative calibration (PROSAC) is also a multi-block data modeling technique, which is helpful for analyzing multi-block data of NIR spectrum data with different pre-processing methods (Mishra et al., 2022). This technique has superior performance and shows more advantages than sequential (SPORT) and parallel (PORTO) orthogonalized partial least squares regression, for example, it does not need to consider the order of pre-processing and data scaling after pre-processing. In most studies, the purpose of pre-processing multi-source data is to obtain the optimal pre-processing method to develop high-precision models. The difficulty in selecting appropriate pre-processing methods to optimize the corresponding data needs to be clearly stated which pre-processing method should be chosen for the problems in the dataset. The use of trial-and-error method filtering in pre-processing methods often overlooks the complementary information carried by different methods, which could be more conducive to obtaining reliable results. The essence of edible crops determines the complexity of its multi-source data. The ensemble pre-processing method can retain complementary information while achieving the optimization effect. It helps to improve the classification and prediction results of edible crops. 2.2.2 Feature extraction/selection Feature extraction/selection is crucial before modeling with multi-source data or performing mid-level data fusion. The massive amount of data generated by multi-source data and the direct fusion of high-dimensional feature datasets increase the complexity of analysis and other issues determining the superiority of feature extraction/selection (Buchaiah & Shakya, 2022). Feature extraction/selection can improve model accuracy, solve model overfitting, reduce data processing time, etc., by reducing dimensionality (eliminating redundant information and noise to retain important features). Some commonly used feature extraction/selection methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), wavelet transform (WT), Fourier transform (FT), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), genetic algorithm (GA), competitive adaptive reweighed sampling (CARS), etc. However, the development of science and technology leads to the continuous increase of data dimension, which makes the feature extraction/selection of multi-source data particularly difficult, and the existing feature extraction/selection methods face unprecedented challenges. Therefore, improving and developing feature extraction/selection methods are necessary. The public gradually recognized the convolutional neural network (CNN) composed of a large number of neurons in the feature extraction of multi-source data fusion (Xiao et al., 2020). 2.2.3 Data fusion strategies With the development of emerging instruments and techniques, the physicochemical information of edible crops can be easily obtained from various sources. Due to the complexity and diversity of the components of edible crops, it is difficult for a single data source to express their complex and complete chemical information. Analyzing them by a single method is not systematic, and it is easy to introduce noise and interference information. Data fusion is a complex process of detecting, combining, correlating, and estimating multi-source data (Lin et al., 2022). By optimizing the information obtained, more reliable inference can be generated than a single data source, so the quality of edible crops can be accurately and in real-time evaluated. There is a desirability to use data fusion to increase and improve the quantity and quality of information available about edible crops. In order to obtain more complementary information, most multi-source data are provided by different instruments. In addition to the instrumental analysis technique, information obtained from different sensor techniques and physical and chemical analysis can be used as the source of data fusion. The following was a brief introduction to these three data fusion strategies. Low-level data fusion concatenates raw data with similar variance and quantity from different platforms to form a new data matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of samples and the number of columns equal to the number of variables. Although the operation of this data fusion strategy is more straightforward than the other two, it also has more variables and takes longer to calculate. This means that there is still a large amount of redundant information in the newly formed data matrix. Mid- and low-level data fusion are similar in that they are both carried out at the data level, the difference is that the former needs to extract features from the raw data before fusion. Moreover, mid-level data fusion can solve some problems existing in low-level data fusion, such as reducing redundant information and eliminating noise and interference. Mid-level data fusion compresses the amount of information to a certain extent, which is conducive to real-time analysis. High-level data fusion is the independent analysis of raw data from each source, and then the fusion of their results to produce a final decision. High-level data fusion has the significant advantage that each data source does not interact with each other and suffers less interference (Li et al., 2020b). However, data fusion in this way has a high probability of causing information loss, so care must be taken when processing the raw data (Borras et al., 2015). In the current study, low- and mid-level data fusion is mainly used for quantitative analysis of edible crops, while high-level data fusion is usually used for qualitative analysis. 3 Machine learning 3.1 Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is a training method of machine learning for statistical analysis. Its main goal is to discover the inherent hidden properties of the dataset by calculating the commonalities between unlabeled samples, so as to avoid the trouble of labeling samples in supervised learning (Su et al., 2022). Due to the nature of unsupervised learning, it is often used as a powerful tool for label-expensive analysis or irrelevant applications (Wang & Biljecki, 2022). Although unsupervised learning cannot directly perform classification and regression, it has significant advantages in real-time data analysis (Cao et al., 2021b). Unsupervised learning has become one of the important solutions to problems such as detection, denoising, and recognition. Next, we will briefly introduce several unsupervised learning algorithms. Fig. 2 showed different unsupervised learning algorithms\u2019 advantages, shortcomings, and development. 3.1.1 Clustering Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning for data mining that divides datasets into different clusters based on similarity to reveal the inherent properties of data (Ay et al., 2023). The choice of distance metric is important for quantifying similarity between data and affects the shape and configuration of the formation of clusters (Tarnutzer & Weber, 2022). Due to the strong practicality of clustering, it has become popular in applications such as pattern recognition and multivariate data analysis of edible crops. Hierarchical clustering is able to provide different resolution results without knowing a predetermined number of clusters, but it has the defects of inaccuracy and high time cost. In response to the above problems, Varshney et al. (2022) came up with the Probabilistic Intuitionistic Fuzzy Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (PIFHC), which used probabilistic Euclidean distance as a distance measure to eliminate uncertainty in the data through intuitive fuzzy sets. The results showed that the clustering accuracy of PIFHC is significantly better than that of other clustering algorithms. 3.1.2 Dimensionality reduction Because of the characteristics of high-dimensional data, it is difficult to understand and analyze directly, and the use of all variables that contain high correlation leads to confusion of information (Xu & Wu, 2022). Data dimensionality reduction is achieved by mapping high-dimensional data to low-dimensional feature space, which reduces redundant information without losing important data structures (Flexa et al., 2021). Dimensionality reduction is divided into two types: linear and nonlinear. PCA is the most classical and popular linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, which aims to minimize the mean square error to achieve the goal of dimensionality reduction (Li et al., 2022). PCA uses linear transformation to convert a group of multivariable into several comprehensive variables. The newly generated variable is the principal component derived from the variance\u2013covariance matrix (Aidoo et al., 2021). Because the principal components are orthogonal to each other, and each principal component represents different information, they can explain most of the original data information, significantly improving the efficiency of data processing. In this algorithm, the reduction of dimensions promotes the visualization of hidden attributes and the correlation of data in PC space (Boubchir et al., 2022). At present, PCA is also increasingly used to explore edible crops\u2019 different components and geographical origins. However, traditional PCA is vulnerable to noise interference and lacks robustness, Qiao et al. (2022) proposed robust PCA to solve the above problems. The results showed that the improved algorithm has advantages and effectiveness. PCA cannot retain the local structure of the dataset, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) emerges as the times require. t-SNE, as the most popular nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, has a strong ability to capture manifold structure in high-dimensional data, attracting much attention in machine learning (Maaten & Hinton, 2008). The main purpose of t-SNE is to balance two conditional probability distributions (input data and low dimensional representation) using the gradient descent method (Flexa et al., 2021). Compared with other nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms, t-SNE is considered the best tool to convert high-dimensional data into 2D or 3D, which is conducive to visualizing edible crops\u2019 multi-source data sets (Maaten & Hinton, 2008). It is sensitive to the selected super parameters and distance measurement. In order to make up for its shortcomings, Flexa et al. (2021) proposed a new t-SNE algorithm, that is, a polygonal coordinate system-based deterministic strategy combined with t-SNE, called t-Distributed deterministic Neighbor Embedding (t-DNE). The results of Friedman\u2019s significance test showed that a polygonal coordinate system has significant advantages in data embedding. 3.2 Supervised learning Supervised learning is a branch of machine learning algorithms, and is the most widely used algorithm at present. It is mainly applied to two problems: One is the regression problem when the variables are continuous; the other is the classification problem when the sample data is a category. Supervised learning is trained by the sample data of an artificial marker, which requires a large sample size to achieve the expected model performance. Although this algorithm requires high calculation and time cost, it is undeniable that the performance of supervised learning is much better than unsupervised learning (Yakimovich et al., 2021). Table S1 compared different supervised learning algorithms\u2019 advantages, limitations, and development. This review mainly introduced the following supervised learning algorithms. Fig. 3 showed the schematic diagrams of four supervised learning algorithms. 3.2.1 Regression 3.2.1.1 Partial least squares regression (PLSR) PLSR is a mature analytical chemistry tool, that plays an important role in multivariate statistical analysis, so it is often used in data analysis (Metz et al., 2021). It combines three basic algorithms: PCA, canonical correlation analysis, and multivariate linear regression analysis. The purpose of PLSR is to minimize the variance of the prediction and maximize the covariance of matrices X and Y (He et al., 2015). The algorithm can extract the PCs of the input and output matrices at the same time, so it has a good effect in dealing with multicollinearity problems and noise data, especially when the internal variables are highly linearly correlated (Ma et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2018). However, the PLSR model is susceptible to outliers, which reduces the model\u2019s predictive power (Metz et al., 2021). The proposal of domain adaption regularization-based kernel partial least squares regression (DarKPLS) is beneficial to improving the adaptive ability of the model, which has also been confirmed in subsequent research (Shan et al., 2023). 3.2.1.2 Support vector regression (SVR) SVR is developed from a support vector classifier and is widely used in nonlinear regression problems (Liu et al., 2020). This method is an excellent regularization algorithm based on kernel because it can estimate the distance between the hyperplane and boundary line (Rezaei et al., 2023). The advantage of SVR lies in its excellent handling of high-dimensional regression tasks, and its ability to minimize empirical risk and confidence interval to solve the problem of model overfitting (Shen et al., 2023). Moreover, in the case of a limited sample size, the global optimal solution can still be obtained from the existing knowledge and experience. Traditional SVR still has some drawbacks, which rely on relevant parameters and priori knowledge, and have high computational costs during the training phase (Shen et al., 2023). In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional SVR, Peng (2010) developed a twin SVR, which has a faster training speed and stronger regression ability. 3.2.2 Classification 3.2.2.1 PLS-DA PLS-DA is a multivariate statistical analysis method that reduces dimensionality by extracting features (Ma et al., 2020). PLS-DA successfully divides the space into two regions by a straight line to classify samples. Its discriminant rule is to compare the predicted response values of Y to a fixed scalar threshold (usually 0.5) (Jimenez-Carvelo et al., 2021a). Correctly selecting the number of latent variables is critical to constructing a PLS-DA model because too many latent variables will lead to overfitting of the model, while an insufficient number of latent variables will lead to underfitting of the model. Generally, the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) determines the number of latent variables selected. PLS-DA has apparent advantages in dealing with highly collinear and noise. Therefore, PLS-DA is widely used in classification and adulteration identification of edible crops (Vieira et al., 2021). 3.2.2.2 Support vector machine (SVM) SVM, as an effective classification method, is mainly based on statistical theory and has attracted more and more attention in related fields, such as data mining and machine learning (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995). Recently, SVM has been widely used in pattern recognition and classification analysis of edible crops (Park et al., 2015). Essentially, the SVM model achieves the purpose of separating the positive and negative classes by constructing the best-fitting hypersurface in a high-dimensional space (Lamberti, 2021). The important parameters of the support vector machine model are the penalty parameter (c) and kernel function (g). Suppose the parameter c is too high or too low. In that case, it will affect the model\u2019s performance, so the model\u2019s complexity is controlled by adjusting the parameter c. In contrast, the parameter g determines the complexity of the data distribution in the high-dimensional feature space (Wu et al., 2018). These two parameters determine the accuracy and generalization ability of the model to a certain extent. Cross-validation is usually used to determine the best parameters of the model. The optimization algorithm of parameters adopts GA, Grid Search (GS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), etc. (Huang et al., 2020). However, compared with the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, the above SVM optimization algorithms are prone to premature convergence and local optimization, thus GWO has more advantages in function optimization, simple operation, and few parameters (Liang et al., 2022). These optimization algorithms can make up for the defects of SVM to a certain extent. 3.2.2.3 Random forest (RF) RF integrates the decision tree and uses statistical estimation to predict and classify, while the decision tree is generated by selecting training samples and variable subsets through replacement (a bagging approach) (Liang et al., 2020). The RF model is constructed by a recursive partition containing hundreds of decision trees. The value stored in each node of the decision tree is related to the variables of classification information (Lovatti et al., 2019). There are two important parameters in random forest, one is Ntree, and the other is Mtry. The model\u2019s performance is usually evaluated using Ntree, and the best split node is determined by the best binary split result of Mtry. The split stops when the training samples on all decision trees have the same category on their corresponding nodes (Liang et al., 2020). Due to the large number of decision trees in the RF model, the processing of the model is more complex. Therefore, it is necessary to use the out-of-bag error rate (OOB) to optimize the parameters, adjust the number of decision trees and improve the model\u2019s performance (Wang et al., 2020). Compared with other statistical analysis methods, RF is a relatively new pattern recognition method to solve the problem of recognition and prediction, which can overcome the difficulties of traditional chemometrics in classifying data with many variables and few samples, and its risk of overfitting is lower and more robust than a single decision tree. However, before establishing the model of RF, some super parameters need to be established artificially, which increases the calculation cost and even affects the accuracy of the results due to some errors in the selection process. Feng et al. (2021) used an improved artificial bee colony algorithm (IABC) combined with RF to optimize the super parameters of the model, which greatly improved the calculation efficiency. 3.2.2.4 Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) SIMCA is a supervised pattern recognition technique, which is not only a powerful tool for processing, distinguishing, and classifying complex data, but also one of the commonly used classification methods in chemometrics (Gomez-de Anda et al., 2012). In each category, SIMCA performs PCA on it, builds a multi-dimensional space around the calculated PCs, and then classifies unknown samples by the distance between samples and models (Duca et al., 2016). The results of SIMCA are expressed in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and the higher the efficiency of cross-validation, the better performance of the model (Firmani et al., 2020). Although SIMCA is very sensitive to outliers and will affect the classification results to a certain extent, the advantage of SIMCA is that the unknown classification object will only be assigned to the category with the highest possibility, and if the residual variance of the sample exceeds the upper limit of each class in the modeling data set, it will not be assigned (Khanmohammadi et al., 2013). Because SIMCA has a strong ability to capture spectral signal differences caused by different chemical components, it is often used to process spectral data of edible crops. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional SIMCA, robust-SIMCA, and data driven-soft independent modeling of class analogy (dd-SIMCA) improve its performance from different perspectives (Adenan et al., 2020; Rodionova et al., 2016). 3.2.2.5 K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) KNN is one of the most common algorithms in artificial intelligence and is widely used in data mining and pattern recognition (Xiong & Yao, 2021). The KNN algorithm does not require training data, so it is the simplest supervised learning algorithm. It is based on the majority voting rule. It compares the Euclidean distance to determine the nearest K points in the attribute space and then categorizes the unknown samples into the most frequent category among the K points. The value of K represents the number of nearest neighbors to the unknown sample. The KNN algorithm has been used in the classification and regression prediction of edible crops. Choosing appropriate K values can improve accuracy, which is advantageous when applied to samples with little or no experience (Guo et al., 2022a; Kiran Naik et al., 2021). The KNN algorithm does not preprocess the data before classification, it takes time and space in the processing process, and it is difficult to select the value of K (Wang et al., 2022a). Even, the KNN algorithm ignores the correlation between sample features, resulting in high computational complexity and slow classification speed (Ji et al., 2022). Romero-del-Castillo et al. (2022) presented a new method for KNN optimization, which introduced a local K value into a multi-label label-KNN classifier to find the optimal K value. 3.2.2.6 CNN CNN is considered the most popular deep learning structure, it is a deep feedforward neural network and a powerful feature extraction tool (Liu et al., 2021a). It is only sparsely connected to the neurons of the next layer according to the position of the neurons in the convolution layer, is different from ordinary neural networks, and relies on the convolution kernel to realize the mutual conversion of weights, which improves the learning time (Debus et al., 2021). Residual neural network (ResNet) is one of the most advanced CNN models, which optimizes the problem of vanishing or exploding gradient in deep learning models through shortcut connection. At the same time, the residual module is introduced to improve the problem of model degradation caused by the increase in the number of layers in the CNN. Using shortcut connection has obvious advantages, neither adding extra parameters nor increasing computational costs (He et al., 2016). CNN and ResNet can classify edible crops by identifying two-dimensional spectral images or hyperspectral images. The above are only commonly used fields at present, and this algorithm is increasingly used for disease and pest detection or yield prediction. 3.2.2.7 Artificial neural network (ANN) ANN is a product of technological progress, which occupies a place with strong computing power and ultra-fast data processing speed. The mechanism by which the human brain nervous system processes complex information is the source of inspiration for generating ANN, where information is transformed and transmitted within neurons (Ng et al., 2019). ANN is interconnected by neurons to form complex neural networks, so the number of neurons in the hidden layer is important to ensure the model\u2019s accuracy and avoid overfitting (Wang et al., 2019). Benefiting from its powerful data processing capabilities, it can be used to solve the classification problem of edible crops and the regression problem. However, ANN relies excessively on large sample sizes and requires sufficient training data to maintain the stability of the model (Kholi et al., 2023). To improve the ANN model, Yuan et al. (2023) proposed a self-adjusting particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm to optimize the weights, thresholds, and number of neurons of the ANN. 4 Applications In the context of economic globalization, edible crops have become one of the hot objects in the world, and their quality and safety issues have caused public concern. There are many kinds of edible crops, covering a wide range. The origin, species, content of main chemical components, storage period, and artificial adulteration are all crucial factors affecting their quality. Therefore, it is urgent to find a scientific and effective method to evaluate the quality of edible crops. Using machine learning to mine chemical information to represent quality has become one of the most popular methods at present. There are two main ways: One is to directly use multi-source data in combination with machine learning for evaluation, and the other is to process multi-source data through data fusion strategy and then conduct quality authentication with machine learning. Table 1 emphasized the application of machine learning in the quality evaluation of edible crops. Tables S2 and S3 summarized the applications of the above two methods in the quality evaluation of edible crops in detail. 4.1 Application of multi-source data to quality evaluation of edible crops 4.1.1 Qualitative perspective Multi-source data is conducive to representing the quality of edible crops from different perspectives. Better quality evaluation methods can be obtained by comparing the results of machine learning modeling based on two or more single data sources. Amirvaresi et al. (2021) compared the ability of NIR and MIR to detect the geographical origin and adulteration of Iranian saffron. First of all, the PCA models of NIR and MIR spectra based on mean-centering and second derivative pretreatment were established to visually analyze the authentic saffron samples from different regions in Iran. Comparing the modeling results, it was found that the PCA based on NIR had a better ability to predict the distribution of saffron samples. Secondly, PLS-DA and PLSR models were established using NIR and MIR spectra after pretreatment to detect authentic saffron and adulterated samples. The qualitative analysis showed that the discrimination models based on NIR and MIR spectra had good classification performance, but the NIR showed more accurate and excellent identification results. Quantitative analysis also showed the same results, only NIR can effectively quantify the adulteration rate in authentic saffron samples. In conclusion, NIR spectroscopy can be used as a powerful tool for geographical traceability and adulteration detection of saffron. In a similar method, a series of machine learning algorithms named PCA, HCA, and PLS-DA were constructed with NIR and MIR spectra as input data to distinguish 33 kinds of hops for commercial purposes (Machado et al., 2018). The research showed that the accuracy of NIR and MIR modeling after feature band extraction and standard normal variate (SNV) and combined Savitzky-Golay filter smoothing pretreatment was 96.6% and 94.2%, respectively, which proved that NIR and MIR spectroscopy could be used as a green, convenient and non-destructive method to identify commercial hop varieties. The quality of white teas mainly depends on the maturity of fresh leaves, Li et al. (2020a) collected the chemical fingerprint information (NIR and HPLC) of white tea samples produced from fresh leaves with different maturity. The results showed that the clustering effect of PCA based on the concentration of 39 compounds was not satisfactory, while the PCA based on NIR could quickly identify white tea samples with different maturity, which illustrated the advantages of the NIR technique applied to the quality evaluation of white tea. 4.1.2 Quantitative perspective The combination of data from different sources is also one of the popular methods in the field of edible crop quality evaluation, mainly used for the content prediction and analysis of chemical components. Cottonseed is one of the important oilseed crops, and fatty acid and protein are important quality evaluation indicators. Cottonseed is one of the important oil-bearing crops, and its important quality evaluation indicators are fatty acid and protein. Zhuang et al. (2023) obtained the phenotypic data of 17 fatty acids, oil, and proteins in shell-intact upland cottonseed using GC\u2013MS and Soxhlet extraction methods, and correlated the content with the preprocessed NIR datasets through PLSR. The NIR spectral region of 950\u20131650 nm was selected as the model input data because fatty acids and proteins have strong absorption peaks in this range. The report demonstrated that the established method could accurately predict the content of 14 fatty acids, oils, and proteins. Unfortunately, the calibration model performance of three fatty acids still needs to be improved. This study laid a foundation for the quality evaluation of cottonseed in practical application. The linear regression method-PLSR was used in the above study, but in some special cases, the linear regression method is not applicable. The development of nonlinear regression methods such as ANN provides a solution to this problem. Xue et al. (2021) used HPLC to detect the contents of three active components in Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and combined with NIR, and implemented two types of calibration models, namely PLSR and ANN, to predict chlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid A and isochlorogenic acid C in Lonicerae Japonicae Flos. The results showed that in the PLSR model, the best pretreatment methods of near-infrared spectra of chlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid A, and isochlorogenic acid C were first derivative, first derivative + straight line subtraction (SLS), and first derivative + vector normalization (VN), respectively. At the same time, the selection of spectral region greatly affects the results of the model. The spectral region suitable for the prediction of chlorogenic acid was 12000\u20134250 cm\u22121, and that of isochlorogenic acid A and isochlorogenic acid C was 7500\u20134250 cm\u22121. In the ANN model, the best spectral pretreatment of chlorogenic acid was still the first derivative and the best pretreatment of isochlorogenic acid A and isochlorogenic acid C were SLS and VN, respectively. Comparing the results of six calibration models, it is found that the model suitable for the prediction of chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid A content was PLSR, and ANN was the best strategy for the prediction of isochlorogenic acid C. Proof by facts, NIR spectroscopy is an effective technique for quality evaluation of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos. To sum up, spectral pretreatment and selection of characteristic regions are very important, which lays a solid foundation for establishing a robust model and obtaining accurate results. More accurate inference is generated through information complementation between multi-source data than that of a single data source. However, analysis efficiency is a concern due to the huge amount of information. The proposed data fusion strategy not only simplifies the process of multi-source data processing and improves the efficiency of data analysis but also can obtain more complete and unified information, which is conducive to strengthening the robustness of decision-making. 4.2 Application of data fusion strategy in edible crops 4.2.1 Identification variety There are many varieties of edible crops, and their appearance and morphology are similar, but there are differences in chemical components, sensory, and other aspects. Therefore, in order to protect the rights and interests of consumers and market order, variety identification is an essential step. Teye et al. (2014) studied the feasibility of data fusion of NIR spectroscopy and electronic tongue for distinguishing five cocoa bean varieties. After SNV pretreatment, the spectral area of 9500\u20137500 cm\u22121 was selected as the modeling data for NIR, the data of the two sensors were combined through PCA, and the best variables were selected. Using a single data source and fused data as input to establish the SVM classification model, the results showed that the classification accuracy of SVM based on electronic tongue and NIR was 92%\u201393% and 80%\u201381%, respectively, while the performance of the SVM model for data fusion was greatly improved, and the recognition accuracy was 100%. Dankowska & Kowalewski (2019) collected UV\u2013Vis, synchronous fluorescence (SF), and NIR information on different types of tea and carried out low-level data fusion on different data combinations (SF + UV\u2013Vis, NIR + UV\u2013Vis, SF + NIR, and SF + UV\u2013Vis + NIR). Used PCA to realize data dimensionality reduction and then built Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA), and SVM models for the single data source and four low-level data fusion. By comparing and analyzing the modeling results, the classification effect of data fusion was significantly better than that of a single data source, with an error of less than 3%. The research has proved that different spectral information can complement each other, and improve classification accuracy, and the developed method can effectively prevent tea fraud. In another study, the gustatory and olfactory sensor systems were combined with machine learning (PCA, LDA) to quickly identify different varieties of Oolong tea (Chen et al., 2015). The feature extraction of the data points of the Cyclic voltammetry in the gustatory sensors system and the average of the center of each dye point in the olfactory sensors system were performed. The mid-level data fusion was performed after the above operations were completed. The author found that it is difficult to accurately evaluate different kinds of Oolong tea by using an olfactory or gustatory sensor system alone. The use of a data fusion strategy can provide more comprehensive information and improve classification accuracy. The accuracy of the LDA model based on data fusion reached 100%. The results indicated that the data fusion strategy has a promising prospect in classifying Oolong tea varieties. 4.2.2 Geographical traceability The natural environment is an important factor affecting edible crops' quality, resulting in uneven product quality from different geographical origins. The proposal of geographical indication protection makes the public pay more attention to the source of products. Mandrile et al. (2019) identified cocoa shell samples from different geographical origins by fusing data from NIR, ATR-FT-IR, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and combining the PLS-DA model. Compared with the modeling results of a single data source, the model effect of data fusion was more satisfactory, and the classification accuracy was higher. In order to identify palm oil from different geographical sources, a data fusion strategy and PLS-DA were used to carry out research (Obisesan et al., 2017). Feature variables were extracted through interval partial least squares (iPLS) and PCA, respectively, to implement further low- and high-level data fusion strategies for two groups (HPLC-UV, HPLC-CAD) of data sources. The results showed that the data fusion strategy significantly improved the classification accuracy of a single data source, and the accuracy of iPLS as a feature variable extraction method was 100%. Amomum tsao-ko is easily affected by the geographical environment, resulting in different qualities of different origins. Liu et al. (2021b) used the mid-level data fusion strategy to integrate the information of FT-NIR and UV\u2013Vis to identify the origin of Amomum tsao-ko, adopted four methods of feature variable extraction: PCA, VIP, sequential and orthogonalized partial-least squares (SO-PLS), sequential and orthogonalized covariance selection (SO-CovSel). Spectral preprocessing was a combination of S-G, variables sorting for normalization (VSN), and first derivative. PLS-DA models based on four feature extraction methods were established respectively. The results showed that the classification ability of the model was excellent when so-pls was used as the feature extraction method of data fusion, which laid a theoretical foundation for the geographical traceability and even the quality and safety of Amomum tsao-ko. 4.2.3 Quality control In addition to natural factors, the quality of edible crops is also affected by many factors, such as product processing, cultivation methods, and storage period. Therefore, it is very necessary to find a fast and scientific quality control method applied to the industrial chain of edible crops. In the existing research, data fusion combined with machine learning has been widely used as a powerful tool for quality control. The quality of black tea is affected by the degree of fermentation, and changes in the content of tea polyphenols will accompany it. For this reason, tea polyphenols content is an important indicator to determine the classification of different degrees of fermentation of black tea. FT-NIR, computer vision system, and mid-level data fusion were employed to detect the fermentation degree of black tea so as to achieve the purpose of quality control (Jin et al., 2020). Feature extraction is an important part of mid-level data fusion. This study implemented two feature extraction strategies, one was to use PCA to extract the features of FT-NIR and computer vision system, and the other was to extract the features of FT-NIR and computer vision system, respectively, through SPA and Pearson correlation for subsequent research. KNN, LDA, and SVM were used to analyze the above data sets. The results obtained by the SVM model of data fusion were better than that of single data source and other data fusion models. Among them, the best feature extraction method was PCA. 4.2.4 Adulteration detection In order to obtain greater benefits, illegal businesses fill the gap in the market by adulterating. The adulterants usually do not cause changes in taste and chemical composition, which makes it difficult to identify with the naked eye. It is urgent to adopt reliable and convenient methods to detect adulteration in edible crops. Vibration spectroscopy is widely used in adulterating olive oil due to its non-destructive, low-cost, and fast advantages. Li et al. (2019) applied three data fusion strategies to integrate NIR and MIR and combined them with the PLSR model to quantify adulterants in olive oil. Taking RESEP as the model performance evaluation index, it can be concluded that the prediction accuracy of low-level (3.44) and high-level data fusion (2.86) is higher than that of NIR (7.09), MIR (4.04), and mid-level data fusion (6.09), respectively. It is worth pondering that SPA, as a feature extraction method for intermediate data fusion, did not improve the model\u2019s performance, which showed the importance of selecting appropriate feature extraction for fusion results. Tata et al. (2022) used completely different techniques from the above research to detect the adulteration of olive oil. Performed low and mid-level data fusion for the four data sets of LC \u2013 (+/\u2212) MS, gas-chromatography ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), and flash gas-chromatography electronic nose (FGC-E-nose), and then analyzed the fused data using PLS-DA-SVM. Low-level data fusion based on GC-IMS and FGC-E-nose has the highest classification accuracy (0.96) and may provide a new way to detect olive oil adulteration. The results of both studies demonstrated that a data fusion strategy combined with machine learning has a bright future in adulteration detection. 4.2.5 Content prediction Chemical composition is the key index to measure the quality of edible crops. Accurate evaluation of chemical composition content is one of the ways to improve the quality of edible crops. The correlation between spectroscopy and chemical component content is one of the most popular content prediction methods at present. MIR and NIR data fusion was proposed to predict the polyphenol content in Chinese dates (Arslan et al., 2019). Pre-processed NIR and MIR with SNV and de-trending, and used Si-PLS to extract their characteristic variables to establish the PLS model of two fusion strategies (NIR-MIR fusion, GA-fusion). GA-fusion-PLS model has the best prediction ability, with an RPD of 2.44. Polyphenol and catechin undergo different degrees of oxidation with the change in the processing degree of black tea. Wang et al. (2021b) collected the data of NIR and computer vision of black tea in different processing steps on the spot, and used low- and mid-level data fusion strategies to jointly analyze them. It is worth noting that in order to improve the performance of the calibration model, the following two operations were carried out before modeling: (1) Pearson correlation analysis and CARS were used as the feature variable extraction methods of computer vision and NIR respectively; (2) Select S-G smoothing as the pre-processing method of NIR. Comparing the results of PLS models based on a single data source and two data fusion strategies, it was concluded that mid-level data fusion could make up for the deficiency of single data and improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Unfortunately, low-level data fusion cannot overcome the low prediction accuracy of single data. In general, the combination of spectroscopy and imaging systems can be used as an effective content prediction method. 5 Challenges and prospects The combination of multi-source data and machine learning has been widely used in edible crops, and many studies have proven that they are powerful quality evaluation tools with promising application prospects. However, it has to be acknowledged that there are still many undiscovered development opportunities for this method that are worth further exploration. Multi-source data, machine learning, and applications are the most important components of this review, and their challenges and future prospects will be discussed in this section. (1) Multi-source data. Every step, from data acquisition to multi-source data processing, is crucial. Spectroscopy, chromatography, and new sensor systems are the leading techniques for obtaining multi-source data. First of all, these instruments and equipment are suitable for analysis in specific locations, which could be more conducive to real-time detection on the market. The quality evaluation of edible crops requires more convenient analytical instruments, and the emergence of a portable NIR spectrometer is a good start. However, it is regrettable that its accuracy cannot meet the desktop standard, and infrared detection has special requirements for illumination, moisture, etc., which limits its application in the market. The development of portable instruments is a prerequisite for further market use while improving the accuracy of instrument testing is a problem that must be addressed in development. Sensor systems are non-destructive and intelligent. Currently, sensor systems have been used as a substitute for traditional analytical techniques, and they are a class of techniques with great development space. They exhibit excellent performance in qualitative analysis, and accurate quantitative analysis is still a problem that needs to be tackled by such techniques. Quantitative analysis of edible crops relies on chromatographic techniques, but their use runs counter to the concept of green environmental protection. The development of environmentally friendly reagents is particularly important. Secondly, the type of data combination is also a way to improve the accuracy of results. For example, the results obtained by combining different data sources are inconsistent (Dankowska & Kowalewski, 2019). Wang et al. (2023) also found that combining Raman and NIR spectroscopy can improve prediction accuracy. Therefore, selecting suitable complementary sources as data combinations can obtain more complete information and improve the accuracy and stability of data analysis. However, the large amount of information in multi-source data makes data processing difficult, and the fusion strategy is an effective means of data processing. Many studies have shown that fusion strategies improve the performance of classification or regression models by integrating multi-sources of information to obtain more comprehensive information. High-level data fusion applications in this area are not as good as expected, and only a few have met the requirements. However, high-level data fusion still has great potential in the application of multi-source data for edible crops, so it is necessary to further explore it in order to improve accuracy and robustness. Last but not least, both multi-source data and data fusion have factors such as redundant data or noise that affect the model\u2019s performance, pre-processing and feature extraction are the most critical steps in data processing accordingly. Notably, each pre-processing method solves different problems, and selecting appropriate pre-processing based on the attributes of the data can achieve the goal of optimization. Similarly, selecting feature extraction methods should also be based on multiple perspectives. Currently, there are no reasonable solutions to the determination of pre-processing combinations and multi-dimensional data feature extraction, and further in-depth research is needed to address these issues. (2) Machine learning and applications. Although unsupervised learning algorithms can reduce time costs, their accuracy, and robustness are not as good as supervised learning methods. Supervised learning methods are limited to a certain extent by manual tagging, which requires a greater amount of manual tagging when applied to more complex systems. Both are subject to factors such as sample size or hyperparameters. With the development of artificial intelligence, neural networks such as ANN, CNN, and ResNet are gradually applied to the research of edible crops due to their powerful performance. They require large amounts of data to support their training process. Most existing research is based on small sample sizes, which poses a significant challenge to neural networks. Hence, selecting machine learning based on the sample size and the problem to be solved is conducive to obtaining better decision results. It is necessary to optimize unsupervised further and supervised learning algorithms or develop a more powerful machine learning algorithm to address the complex and volatile requirements of the field of edible crop research. In the investigated papers, the application of machine learning combined with multi-source data or data fusion strategies in edible crops mainly focuses on: Quality control, content prediction, and geographical identification. It can be seen that this method also has a certain potential in other research fields of edible crops and needs further investigation. 6 Conclusions The research on edible crops has been a hot topic in food and agriculture. Although the existing research has made some progress in the quality evaluation of edible crops, it is difficult to characterize the quality with a single analytical technique fully. An accurate, fast, reliable, and robust quality evaluation method is urgently needed. Machine learning is a gift of rapid development in the era of science and technology. Using it to process and analyze multi-source data has great potential in the application of edible crops. This review summarized the recent application of machine learning combined with multi-source data in edible crops. In addition, the limitations and future application prospects of the method were also discussed. Multi-source data is not a supplement to a single data source. It can absorb different data information characteristics, obtaining more accurate and reliable results than a single data source. Data fusion is a commonly used strategy for processing multi-source data, which can extract valuable and accurate target information from complementary data. Low- and mid-level data fusion is favored in classification and regression applications, especially mid-level data fusion, which has unique advantages in filtering noisy data and reducing data dimensionality. Moreover, machine learning is a very critical part of the process of edible crop quality evaluation, and selective use based on data attributes and purposes can achieve ideal results. Data pre-processing and feature extraction are also one of the focuses and difficulties of attention. The above four parts (multi-source data, data fusion, machine learning, pre-processing, and feature extraction) all require further research to break through bottlenecks. This review can provide constructive suggestions for the quality evaluation methods of edible crops so as to improve the applicability of market monitoring.

By combining machine learning with the design of experiments, thereby achieving so-called active machine learning, more efficient and cheaper research can be conducted. Machine learning algorithms are more flexible and are better than traditional design of experiment algorithms at investigating processes spanning all length scales of chemical engineering. While active machine learning algorithms are maturing, their applications are falling behind. In this article, three types of challenges presented by active machine learning\u2014namely, convincing the experimental researcher, the flexibility of data creation, and the robustness of active machine learning algorithms\u2014are identified, and ways to overcome them are discussed. A bright future lies ahead for active machine learning in chemical engineering, thanks to increasing automation and more efficient algorithms that can drive novel discoveries. Keywords Active machine learning Active learning Bayesian optimization Chemical engineering Design of experiments 1 Introduction Experiments performed under well-defined conditions and calculations based on first principles constitute the basis of engineering research. In chemical engineering, these activities are aimed at, for example, the development and optimization of catalysts, reaction conditions, and reactor configurations. In the chemical industry, 51 billion USD was spent in 2017 on research and development [1]. This illustrates the importance of high-quality data; however, obtaining accurate data is tedious and error prone. The design of experiments (DoE) can help in extracting the maximal information with a minimum of effort [2,3], making sure that time and resources are spent efficiently. By integrating machine learning with DoE, a more flexible and efficient DoE is achieved. This so-called \u201cactive machine learning\u201d allows a more effective selection of experimental conditions, particularly for high-dimensional and highly nonlinear phenomena [4]. Machine learning can facilitate the automation of the whole experimental cycle, from experimental selection to model building and data analysis [5]. While the most common field of application in machine learning is model building and data analysis, the focus of this article is on the potential of combining DoE with machine learning for active machine learning. Olsson [6] defined active machine learning as a supervised machine learning technique in which the learner\u2014that is, the machine learning model\u2014is in control of the data from which it learns. In active machine learning, machine learning algorithms are used to iteratively determine new experimental data, the so-called training data, based on uncertainty criteria. It should be noted that \u201cexperimental\u201d can also refer to computationally expensive high-level simulations, such as high-level ab initio calculations of molecular properties or large eddy simulations of reactive flow with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes [7]. Active machine learning consists of two branches with two different purposes: active learning and Bayesian optimization. Active learning aims to explore and model a process with a minimum number of \u201cexperiments\u201d to ensure accurate predictions over the entire design space [8]. Bayesian optimization is essentially a machine learning-based optimization strategy, where iteratively new experimental data is selected to find an experiment that optimizes the objective [9]. Either active learning or Bayesian optimization can be employed for experimental selection, depending on whether the goal is to model a process and acquire process knowledge or to optimize an objective. 1.1 Basic principles of active machine learning Fig. 1 [10] illustrates the general workflow of active machine learning algorithms, starting with the initialization followed by an iterative loop consisting of three phases. The critical first step of initialization consists of clearly defining the research problem as either the modeling of an output (active learning) or the optimization of an objective (Bayesian optimization). An example of active learning is the investigation of the effect of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, on the conversion [10,11]. With Bayesian optimization, the goal is to find the optimal reaction conditions to maximize this conversion [12\u201314]. In both cases, a design space is set up that defines the ranges of the studied variables by considering the objectives and the intrinsic limitations of the experimental tools. A machine learning model is then initialized and trained using a small sample of labeled data, which comes from experiments whose outcomes are known, stemming from literature, previous experiments, or newly performed experiments. In general, the amount of preliminary labeled data is very low. After initial training, the machine learning model is able to make rudimentary predictions in the design space. The model can vaguely estimate where an optimum could be situated for Bayesian optimization, or which experiment\u2014the so-called query\u2014is most informative for active learning. While the definition and initialization of both active learning and Bayesian optimization are essentially the same (and are not even too different from a classic experimental campaign), the main differences and advantages are found in the model training. Active learning is purely based on exploration, to enable predictions of the design space that are as accurate as possible. Conversely, Bayesian optimization balances both exploration and exploitation in order to find the optimum in the design space, treating every iteration as the potentially final one. Exploitation investigates areas with a high objective value to find an optimum nearby, whereas exploration discovers areas for which the predictions are unknown and therefore uncertain. Exploration requires a measure of uncertainty in the predictions to identify which areas of the design space remain unexplored [15]. Therefore, popular machine learning models for active machine learning are Gaussian processes [16\u201319] and Bayesian neural networks [20\u201322], as these allow an uncertainty estimation of their predictions. Another advantage of Gaussian processes is that they deal very well with noisy measurements, which are inherent in real-life experiments. By adding a noise term to the Gaussian process kernel, the machine learning model can estimate the experimental uncertainty and allow optimal performance of the active machine learning method [16,23]. Neural networks can also be employed for active machine learning purposes, but approximative methods such as Monte Carlo dropout or model ensembling are required to estimate the model uncertainty [11,24,25]. After initialization, the active machine learning procedure consists of three phases: the training of the machine learning model, the selection of new experiments, and the execution and annotation of these experiments (Fig. 1). The active machine learning query (phase 2) is determined through a so-called acquisition function, which is a measure of potential informativeness or optimality. The model needs the most informative subsequent data point, which is the point where the acquisition function is maximal for the selected query. The query is performed and new data is gathered (phase 3), after which the machine learning model is retrained (phase 1) and can now make improved predictions. This loop is sequentially iterated until an optimum (Bayesian optimization) is found or a sufficiently accurate model (active learning) is obtained. To further illustrate the workflow, we present the example of a researcher examining the performance of a new catalyst for a chemical process. The researcher either aims to investigate (with active learning) or optimize (with Bayesian optimization) the effect of reaction variables (design space), such as the temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations, on the desired product yield (objective). First, initial experiments must be performed at a number of random combinations of temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations. Next, the researcher initiates the active machine learning loop by training the machine learning model on these randomly picked experimental data points, after which the model proposes a new experiment. When using active learning, this experiment is the most informative one; when optimizing with Bayesian optimization, this experiment is the most likely experiment to improve upon the desired product yield. The researcher performs the experiment and retrains the machine learning model, which now makes improved predictions. The experimental selection continues until the desired number of experiments is performed and an optimal machine learning model or process condition is obtained. 1.2 Active machine learning in chemical engineering The applications of active machine learning span all the length scales of chemical engineering, from ab initio calculations [17,18,26] to material, molecule, and catalyst design [27\u201336], reaction design [12\u201314,37\u201342], and reactor design [43\u201345]. For example, the design of catalysts is an important asset in achieving carbon neutrality, as catalysts can enable more sustainable processes and can increase the energy efficiency of chemical processes in general [46]. However, catalyst design is still deemed an art nowadays, as it mainly relies on high-throughput screening and limited theoretical relations, such as the Sabatier principle and linear scaling relations [47\u201350]. This makes catalyst design prone to human bias, as researchers tend to exploit catalyst designs that are known to work, which hampers real breakthroughs [51,52]. With active machine learning, this human bias is removed, and a substantially larger fraction of the catalyst space can be studied. Currently, the applications of active machine learning in catalysis only consider a limited design space, varying only the catalyst composition while maintaining the catalyst structure [53,54]. For example, Zhong et al. [53] performed Bayesian optimization on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and synthesize promising electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2, whereas Nugraha et al. [54] determined the optimal composition of the most active PtPdAu catalyst to electrocatalytically oxidize methanol. In reaction or process design, the goal of Bayesian optimization is to determine the optimal operating conditions in order to maximize the product yields, minimize the emissions per product, achieve the highest energy efficiency, and so forth. Optimization of reaction conditions has been demonstrated multiple times, including multi-objective reaction optimization with both discrete and continuous variables, likely making this the most well-developed field of active machine learning in chemical engineering [12\u201314]. Shields et al. [39] applied Bayesian optimization to optimize the reaction conditions for a Mitsunobu reaction and obtained an optimal yield (> 99%) for several non-intuitive reaction conditions after 40 experiments, thereby overcoming the standard reaction yield of 60%. With active learning, the goal is to acquire reaction knowledge that can be used for reactor and catalyst design, process control, or retrosynthesis. Eyke et al. [11] demonstrated the potential of active learning for DoE in reaction design by predicting reaction yields for combinations of catalysts and solvents with a minimum of available data. Recently, a DoE tool for the study of chemical reactions was developed and validated on the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste by Ureel et al. [10]. CFD has become an important tool for reactors, optimization, and trouble shooting. Bayesian optimization makes it possible to find an optimal reactor configuration with a minimum of computationally intensive CFD simulations. Park et al. [44] demonstrated the power of multi-objective Bayesian optimization by maximizing the gas holdup and minimizing the power consumption of a stirred tank reactor. Clearly integrating active machine learning in CFD allows for a faster and more efficient reactor design. This survey shows that chemical engineering is a broad and diverse research field with a whole spectrum of possible active machine learning applications. Nevertheless, the use of active machine learning is not yet widespread, and there are some hurdles to overcome before it can become a trusted asset in the chemical engineer\u2019s toolkit. In this perspective article, we focus on active machine learning as a DoE technique for an experimentalist and how to popularize it. We identify three types of thresholds: convincing the experimental researcher, the flexibility of data creation, and the robustness of active machine learning algorithms (Fig. 2 ). In the following sections, we discuss each of these challenges and how they can be overcome. 2 Convincing the researcher 2.1 Big data misconception At present, a knowledge gap exists between the experimentalist community and machine learning experts [55]. This knowledge gap is the fundamental reason why active machine learning is not yet being systematically applied by experimentalists. First, there is a misconception that big data is mandatory for active machine learning and that an enormous experimental campaign is required to make it feasible. Nugraha et al. [54] reported on an optimal catalyst composition performing only 47 of a total of 5151 possible experiments, as shown in Fig. 3 . In their work, Bayesian optimization was employed to determine the optimal PtPdAu catalyst composition for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. Similarly, Schweidtmann et al. [12] identified their Pareto front after 68 experiments for a four-dimensional reaction optimization. Moreover, Ureel et al. [10] showed that active learning strategies are already beneficial for experimental campaigns consisting of as few as 18 experiments. These examples illustrate that both active learning and Bayesian optimization are already feasible for smaller datasets. A second issue is related less to the experimental researcher and more to the intrinsic algorithms. Initially, all active machine learning algorithms explore the entire design space, which can result in counterintuitive or trivial queries. Consequently, the experimentalist loses confidence in the machine learning tool. The initial selection of experiments does not rely on any preliminary or physical knowledge within the machine learning models. Therefore, this issue is related both to human bias and the perception of these algorithms by their users, and to the absence of preliminary knowledge within these models. Integrating process knowledge beforehand in the machine learning model is the most powerful methodology to alleviate this problem. Such knowledge can be incorporated via two different approaches: either through the design of the machine learning model, such as a Gaussian process kernel [56], or through training on literature or simulation data [57]. The incorporation of preliminary knowledge into active machine learning models will be discussed in Section 4.1. 2.2 Ease of use In active learning strategies, multiple factors are varied at the same time, whereas regular DoE strategies often vary a single factor at a time. This makes the post-processing of the experiments less trivial, as the effects of the factors are not isolated. As a result, a statistical analysis is required to draw conclusions from an experimental campaign using an active learning strategy [58]. These tools are incorporated in regular DoE software but not in the active machine learning packages that are currently available. This problem is closely related to another issue that limits the applicability of active learning\u2014namely, its ease of use. Many different active machine learning packages exist these days, such as Gryffin [59], Phoenics [60], and BayesianOptimization [61] for Bayesian optimization, and Gaussian N-dimensional active learning framework (GandALF) [10] or general and efficient active learning (GEAL) [62] for active learning. However, most of the current active machine learning packages must be configured with Python, except for GandALF, which uses a csv spreadsheet. The use of these active machine learning tools requires programming skills, as they offer no graphical user interface (GUI), hampering the usage of these methodologies. Thus, at present, researchers that wish to use active machine learning must make a substantial time investment. This \u201cactivation barrier\u201d is too high for many researchers, particularly because of the required ability to code. 3 Improving the flexibility of data creation 3.1 Constrained active machine learning Active machine learning algorithms are often developed on simulated data, where there are no practical limitations on the data creation side [32,36,63]. However, in real life, experimental units or procedures do not allow this flexibility. For example, even a completely automated experimental unit often needs to heat up or cool down, or requires time to stabilize, which slows down the generation of a new data point when different temperatures are selected by the algorithm. In addition, experiments are often performed in parallel (e.g., in high-throughput units), as opposed to the algorithms, which assume a sequential selection of experiments. Therefore, active machine learning strategies should be constrained to the unit on which they are used, to allow for an optimal experimental efficiency that will make them applicable to real-world applications [64]. In the example above, it is often easier to heat an experimental unit than it is to cool it; therefore, an extra constraint should be added to the algorithm to make it preferable to select experiments that increase rather than decrease in temperature. Next to constraints resulting from how the experimental equipment operates, constraints can also be important for simulations [43,45]. Let us consider a case that involves optimizing a reactor in silico using CFD. When defining the reactor geometry for CFD, it is not trivial that every type of geometry is feasible to simulate, nor that the geometry can be properly meshed or the results are mesh independent [65]. When these constraints are non-trivial, a separate machine learning model can be trained to learn the constraints and enforce the viability of the simulations [43]. Another example with constrained experimental units is a high-throughput experimental campaign that is used to screen different catalytic materials. Within these units, several experimental variables, such as temperature and pressure, are often fixed for every type of experiment per batch. This requires another constraint for the batch selection of these experiments, as the variables must be fixed for all selected queries. To tune active machine learning algorithms according to their application, a close collaboration between the machine learning expert and the experimentalist is thus required. In this way, the benefits of applying active machine learning are also available for less flexible experimental units. Symbiosis between the experimentalist and the machine learning scientist will benefit both parties. First of all, it will extend the fields of application for active machine learning as researchers become more aware of the benefits of active machine learning. This close collaboration will help in identifying useful features within these active machine learning algorithms, such as blocking or automatic post-processing. More practical constraints might be added to the experimental selection, such as the time or cost required for a proposed experiment. Lastly, this collaboration between the experimentalist and the machine learning expert assists in informing experimental researchers and removing the currently existing biases against active machine learning. 3.2 Automation In an ideal case, active machine learning is coupled with a flexible automated experimental unit or is even equipped by a robot [12,14,66]. Thus, the control and optimization of the performance of the experiments can become optimal, saving valuable time and effort. Automated experimental units are increasingly being applied in molecular synthesis and chemical engineering, although these units are not yet commonplace [67\u201369]. One requirement of automated robotic units is that they should be reconfigurable [70]. Moreover, they should have a broad application range and should not be limited to the investigation of a single reaction type or a narrow temperature range. Of course, the use of automated units is not self-evident, as they are often expensive and are currently not well-suited for every problem. For example, despite past efforts [71], the automated synthesis and testing of catalysts is a challenging task, especially when studying a broad design space [72]. By coupling these systems with active machine learning techniques, enormous time saving is expected for experimental campaigns, as this will speed up reaction and catalyst optimization, as well as the acquisition of scientific knowledge. A last threshold of these automated units is the question of the safety of these units. By expanding the catalyst or reaction design space, safety concerns increase, as doing so increases the probability that undesired reactions will occur. Therefore, good chemical knowledge is still required when employing these units in order to identify and incorporate safety constraints. Here, the definition of safety constraints again requires close collaboration between experimental experts and machine learning scientists. 4 Algorithm robustness 4.1 Data transfer When performing experiments, it is advantageous for the experiments to be widely applicable and to serve multiple purposes. The information gathered in experiments should be made available according to the FAIR guiding principles (i.e., findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) and can then be of value for other researchers [73]. However, with active machine learning, a single objective is chosen, which determines the experimental selection. This hampers the applicability of the experiments, as only one experimental output is well-studied. For example, when investigating reactions, the conversion is typically selected as the output of interest; however, this limits the information on other properties, such as yields or selectivity. In the worst-case scenario, the yields are not measured and no information is gathered; contrarily even when these yields are measured, it cannot be guaranteed that all trends are considered in the example. As the goal of active machine learning is to model conversions, this method ignores the behavior of interesting reaction yields, which can result in trends remaining hidden. With Bayesian optimization, this does not pose an issue, as the goal is to optimize an objective, which makes the data per definition less generally applicable. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization techniques exist, whereas only single objective strategies are possible for active learning, meaning that all interesting outputs should be incorporated within a single active learning objective [12,40,44]. Therefore, to ensure the reusability of the gathered data, it is important that not only the modeled output but also other potential relevant outputs are measured during experiments. After creating data that is of wide interest, it is important to be able to incorporate that knowledge into active machine learning tools. Fig. 4 summarizes the different data sources and modeling strategies that can be employed to achieve this. When an active machine learning model is pretrained on literature data, an improved initial experimental selection is achieved that resolves the issue of suboptimal initial selection that was mentioned earlier [57]. The incorporation of literature data is trivial when the experimental uncertainty is similar to that of the newly gathered data. However, when the literature data is of better or inferior quality than the gathered data, it is important for the machine learning model to be able to make a distinction between the two. Heteroscedastic machine learning models exist [63], but they do not necessarily permit the incorporation of two separate noise factors, as the variation in noise is dependent on the variable in heteroscedastic models. Conversely, multi-fidelity active machine learning strategies make it possible to employ widely abundant low-quality data for accurate pretraining of the active machine learning model [74\u201376]. These methods have been developed based on simulated \u201cexperimental\u201d data only, but they are very promising for improving the performance of active machine learning tools when applied to real experimental data. Moreover, these multi-fidelity models can also be used for the incorporation of data from a mechanistic model into the machine learning model. When the uncertainty of the mechanistic model predictions is known, an appropriate distinction can be made between experimental data and modeled data, both with their respective uncertainties, in the multi-fidelity model. In this way, additional mechanistic information can be incorporated into a machine learning model, which improves the experimental selection. Data that is closely related\u2014but not similar in nature\u2014can also serve as an initialization for active machine learning models [77]. For example, when modeling reactions with one type of catalyst and literature data on another catalyst are available, this data might still contain valuable information for an active learning model [78]. With active transfer learning, the goal is to leverage this knowledge from nearly similar data to obtain a machine learning model with an improved perception of the examined problem. Active transfer learning is the combination of the two main methods of active machine learning and transfer learning to make machine learning less data intensive. With transfer learning, (abundantly) available low-quality data is used to pretrain a machine learning model, which is then refined with a limited amount of high-quality data. In this way, rudimentary physical knowledge is introduced into the machine learning model, which again improves the initial experimental selection. This methodology has been proven to work on the reaction yield classification of cross-coupling reactions, by pretraining a machine learning model on reactions with different nucleophiles [78]. The reuse of literature data within active machine learning applications will further enhance the performance of these tools. The first active transfer learning approaches are being developed within chemical engineering, but further development of algorithms is crucial to make active transfer learning applicable within all domains of chemical engineering. 4.2 Synthesizability Active machine learning can be used to determine the optimal query for either optimization or modeling purposes. However, for certain problems, it is not evident that these queries are executable. For example, in catalyst or molecule design, novel compounds are proposed to synthesize and test the property of interest. Here, the representation of the catalyst or molecule is crucial for the synthesizability of the queries. Synthesizability, which is defined as the feasibility of the proposed queries, refers to whether the proposed catalysts or molecules can be synthesized, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . Often, a vector containing the catalyst composition is a simple representation of a catalyst [54,79]. This ensures the synthesizability of the catalyst but limits the design space explored by the active machine learning algorithm, as only the composition is varied and no structural or geometrical properties are considered. Ideally, the complete catalyst space is considered for every problem by, for example, considering the complete three-dimensional (3D) geometry as a representation of the catalyst site or molecule. However, not every imaginable catalyst\u2019s or molecule\u2019s 3D geometry can be synthesizable, so there is tradeoff between the magnitude of the design space, so-called creativity, and synthesizability. As illustrated by the previous example, the problem of synthesizability essentially boils down to a problem of the machine learning representation upon which constraints are added to enforce synthesizability. One intuitive approach is to use the synthesis process of the catalyst or molecule as the machine learning representation. A vector containing the catalyst composition, calcination temperature and time, and presence of ion exchange or impregnation can be used to represent a catalyst. In this way, the synthesizability of the queries is ensured, as every proposed recipe is executable. However, this representation does not necessarily ensure an easy mapping to the property of interest, and an increased amount of data might be required to model this relation. Aside from this intuitive approach, learned machine learning representations make it possible to create a continuous representation, which ensures the validity of the proposed queries [80,81]. By training recently developed methodologies such as variational auto-encoders or generative adversarial neural networks on a set of synthesizable molecules or catalysts, a learned machine learning representation\u2014that is, a so-called latent space\u2014can be developed, ensuring the synthesizability of the proposed queries [80,82,83]. Upon this representation, additional constraints on the catalyst or molecule can be enforced, according to the application [31]. Finding an adequate representation is always important in machine learning problems. For active machine learning, this representation is essential in order to harmonize both synthesizability and creativity. 5 Conclusions and perspectives Active machine learning is extremely well suited for use by chemical engineering researchers to speed up experimental campaigns ranging from molecule and catalyst design to reaction and reactor design. However, active machine learning is not well-known among experimental researchers, and many active machine learning applications are not currently user friendly. Better collaboration between machine learning experts and chemical engineers can overcome these barriers. Such interactions will also help to tune active machine learning algorithms, depending on the applied (automated) experimental units and procedures, which will improve the performance of these algorithms. A key barrier here is the suboptimal initial experimental selection, which can be overcome by integrating transfer learning and active learning with the aid of multi-fidelity models. Moreover, the application domain of active machine learning can be significantly extended by adapting general active machine learning algorithms to obtain \u201ctailor-made\u201d algorithms, depending on the setup constraints. While the algorithms should be customized, the data should be generally usable, such that performed experiments can serve multiple purposes. By harmonizing synthesizability and creativity, active machine learning is bound to make significant advances in the fields of molecule and catalyst synthesis. Recent promising breakthroughs will allow active machine learning to become an essential tool for the chemical engineer and will further facilitate autonomous and efficient scientific discoveries, which will contribute to a more sustainable chemical industry in the future.

CAS Key Laboratory of Ocean Circulation and Waves, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences Qingdao China Estimation of the ocean subsurface thermal structure (OSTS) is important for understanding thermodynamic processes and climate variability. In the present study, a novel multi-model ensemble machine learning (Ensemble-ML) model is developed to retrieve subsurface thermal structure in the Pacific Ocean by integrating sea surface data with Argo observations. The Ensemble-ML model integrates four individual machine learning models to enhance estimation accuracy and reliability. Our results exhibit good agreement between the satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) data and Argo observations, providing validation for the utilization of these datasets in the Ensemble-ML model. The Ensemble-ML model exhibits better performance compared to individual machine learning models, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.3273 \u00b0C and an average coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) of 0.9905. Notably, incorporating geographical information as input variables enhance model performance, emphasizing the importance of considering spatial context in OSTS estimation. The Ensemble-ML model accurately captures the spatial distribution of OSTS across depths and seasons in the Pacific Ocean, effectively reproducing critical temperature features while maintaining strong agreement with Argo observations. Nevertheless, its performance shows relative weakness within the thermocline layer and the equatorial Pacific region (spanning from 10\u00b0S to 10\u00b0N latitude), which are characterized by complex circulation systems. Despite these challenges, the Ensemble-ML model effectively reproduces the spatial distribution of OSTS of the Pacific Ocean. This indicates the potential of machine learning models, particularly ensemble models, for enhancing OSTS estimation in the Pacific Ocean and other regions, offering valuable insights for future research and applications in physical oceanography. Keywords Ensemble machine learning model Satellite observations Ocean subsurface thermal structure Pacific ocean Data Availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction Ocean temperature, as an important parameter of seawater, plays important roles in various aspects of the Earth\u2019s climate system (Qu et al., 2000; Levitus et al., 2012; Abraham et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2020; Tsubouchi et al., 2021). Changes in temperature can affect various oceanic phenomena, such as marine heatwaves (Smale et al., 2019), water mass formation (Speer and Tziperman, 1992), thermocline layer formation (Du et al., 2020), and the evolution of El Ni\u00f1o (Planton et al., 2021). Moreover, these changes can exert substantial impacts on marine ecosystems (Toseland et al., 2013). Hence, the accurate estimation of the ocean subsurface thermal structure (OSTS) is important for studying marine ecosystems, ocean dynamic processes, and global climate. As the world\u2019s largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean is characterized by complex circulation patterns, rendering it a critical component of the global climate system ( Fig. 1). A comprehensive understanding of the ocean thermal structure in this region holds utmost significance, which plays a significant role in comprehending the impacts of climate change, monitoring marine ecosystems, and forecasting extreme weather events (Trenberth and Caron, 2001; Toseland et al., 2013). Consequently, it is very important to estimate the OSTS in the Pacific Ocean, which is vital for understanding the intricate physical processes governing oceanic and atmospheric interactions and their influences on climate system, such as the underlying mechanisms of El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (McPhaden et al., 2011; Hoell et al., 2014). Traditionally, the OSTS estimation in the Pacific Ocean has largely depended on numerical modeling and assimilative dynamic model methods (Liu et al., 2005; Kako and Kubota, 2009; Yin et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the computational demands imposed by these methodologies are significant, owing to the intricate nature of thermodynamic processes. Thus, the pursuit of a more accurate and efficient approach for OSTS estimation has emerged as a research hotspot. The rapid advancement of satellite remote sensing technology has provided valuable, high-resolution observational data of the sea surface, such as sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface height (SSH), and more. Early studies have demonstrated the existence of surface manifestations of some oceanic subsurface phenomena, which can be used to retrieve the complex structures within the ocean interior through the utilization of sea surface data (Ali et al., 2004; Klemas and Yan, 2014). For example, SSH can be used as indicators of thermocline depth, and its changes can reflect changes in the depth of the thermocline (Wilson and Coles, 2005). SST is closely linked with the ocean's interior temperature structure. It has been demonstrated that SST can be used to estimate the OSTS (Chu et al., 2000). Moreover, Vernieres et al. (2014) and Lu et al. (2016) have illustrated a strong association between SSS and subsurface salinity structures. All these results indicate that there is a close mapping relationship between sea surface variables and subsurface structures. This concept has inspired many researchers to use different approaches to investigate the potential of sea surface parameters for estimating ocean subsurface temperature and salinity structures, including statistical relationships (Yan et al., 2020), empirical orthogonal functions (Meijers et al., 2011), parametric models (Chu et al., 2000), and linear regression models (Guinehut et al., 2012). These innovative approaches have demonstrated significant potential for advancing our understanding of the complex processes governing the ocean as well as its influence on climate and ecosystems. However, it is vital to acknowledge the distinct strengths and limitations inherent in each method, thereby inspiring researchers to delve into innovative approaches for retrieving the intricate structures of the ocean interior through the utilization of sea surface data. Recently, machine learning has gained popularity in geoscience fields, including ocean and atmosphere research, offering new insights into the dynamics and thermodynamic processes of the ocean (Reichstein et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2020). Additionally, machine learning has exhibited promising potential in the prediction of climate variations, contributing to our understanding of Earth's complex climate system (Ham et al., 2019). Therefore, we can utilize the powerful information extraction capabilities of machine learning models to discover the relationship between sea surface data and subsurface structures. In recent years, estimating OSTS using machine learning methods has become a topic of significant interest. Ali et al. (2004) employed an artificial neural network (ANN) approach, utilizing sea surface data to reconstruct the thermal structure. Their findings showed the efficacy of the ANN approach in accurately estimating OSTS using sea surface data. Moreover, they demonstrated its remarkable capability in predicting cyclone tracks (Ali et al., 2007). Wu et al. (2012) utilized a self-organizing map neural network to reconstruct OSTS using sea surface data. Their study demonstrated the superiority of their model over traditional methods in the North Atlantic. Other studies, such as those by Su et al. (2015, 2018, 2021), have demonstrated successful OSTS estimation using different machine learning methodologies. Lu et al. (2019) introduced a clustering-neural network method for estimating subsurface temperature using remote sensing data. Their study revealed the superior performance of the pre-clustered neural network method compared to the non-clustered approach. Bao et al. (2019) employed the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) in conjunction with a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) to successfully estimate the subsurface salinity structure of the Pacific Ocean. Most recently, Meng et al. (2021) proposed a novel machine learning-based model for reconstructing subsurface temperature and salinity structure using a pre-trained neural network, reporting high accuracy compared to traditional linear methods. Despite the advantages shown by machine learning and deep learning methods in estimating OSTS, they still have limitations due to the requirement of large amounts of high-quality data, which is difficult to obtain in oceanography. Researchers are therefore exploring innovative approaches to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of these models under limited data conditions. One such approach is the multi-model ensemble, which has gained popularity in oceanography due to its ability to combine the strengths of multiple models and mitigate the limitations of individual models (Becker et al., 2022). Compared to traditional machine learning methods, the multi-model ensemble has demonstrated a significant advantage in estimating and predicting oceanographic and climate phenomena, such as SST variability and trends, precipitation patterns, and ocean circulation patterns (Stouffer et al., 2006; Weisheimer et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022). Recently, Ko et al. (2023) explored the application of a consensus machine learning model in tropical cyclone (TC) intensity-change forecasting. The consensus machine learning model was based on six classical machine learning models, namely, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, RandomForests, Support Vector Machines, and ANN. Their results indicated that the consensus machine learning model exhibits notable performance in TC intensity-change forecasting, especially in the forecasting of rapid intensification. Here, we propose a novel ensemble machine learning (Ensemble-ML) model to reconstruct the OSTS in the Pacific Ocean by using sea surface data. Our Ensemble-ML model is based on four individual models, including ExtraTrees, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), RandomForest, and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and we use an ANN to combine the outputs of these models. The study is structured as follows: data and methodology are presented in Section 2, followed by a description of the results in Section 3. In Section 4, we provide a summary of our results and insights. 2 Data and methodology 2.1 Data A variety of multisource satellite observations were utilized to estimate the OSTS of the Pacific Ocean in this study. Based on earlier studies, we have selected SST, SSS, SSH anomaly (SSHA), and SSW as inputs for the deep learning model. The SSW data can be divided into eastward wind speed (USSW) and northward wind speed (VSSW) components. Additionally, geographic information such as longitude (LON) and latitude (LAT) were also included as inputs. The monthly SST data utilized in this study, covering the period from January 2010 to December 2020, were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using a 0.25\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 0.25\u00b0 longitude resolution (Reynolds et al., 2002). The monthly SSS data were obtained from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level-3 SSS product with a horizontal resolution of 0.25\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 0.25\u00b0 longitude (Boutin et al., 2018). The monthly SSHA data were obtained from the Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic (AVISO) data center with a horizontal resolution of 0.25\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 0.25\u00b0 longitude (Hauser et al., 2020). The SSW data were derived from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) product with a horizontal resolution of 0.25\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 0.25\u00b0 longitude (Atlas et al., 2011). It should be noted that the SSW has two temporal resolutions: it is monthly from 2010 to 2015 and 1/4 day from 2016 to 2020. The monthly Roemmich-Gilson Argo Climatology (RG-Argo) gridded data, which has a horizontal resolution of 1\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 1\u00b0 longitude, were utilized to train and test the model's performance (Roemmich and Gilson, 2009). All the data used in this study, including the SSW, were monthly averaged from January 2010 to December 2020. They were interpolated onto a 1\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 1\u00b0 longitude grid, covering the Pacific Ocean from 120\u00b0E to 80\u00b0W and from 50\u00b0S to 50\u00b0N. Missing data points were excluded. The data utilized in this paper is summarized in Table 1. 2.2 Methods As mentioned previously, ensemble learning techniques have been widely recognized for their ability to improve estimation accuracy by incorporating the outputs of multiple machine learning models. Among many ensemble learning methods available, ANN is one of the most popular methods for merging multiple models, owing to its effectiveness and simplicity. Based on results of earlier studies, we chose four machine learning models as our foundational models: XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, and ExtraTrees (Callens et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021). Each of these models has demonstrated robust performance in various oceanography-related work. Here, we propose an ANN-based Ensemble-ML model to estimate the OSTS in the Pacific, which combines outputs of four pre-trained individual models. 2.2.1 Machine learning models The XGBoost and LightGBM are two popular gradient boosting frameworks that have gained increasing attention in recent years. XGBoost incorporates the second derivative of the error function at each data point to optimize the loss function (Chen et al., 2015). During model training, it only uses a subset of samples and features for training, effectively improving model generalization ability and reducing underfitting and overfitting phenomena. LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, has garnered significant attention in recent years for its remarkable efficiency and accuracy surpassing other boosting frameworks. It can divide continuous features into discrete bins using a histogram-based algorithm to handle sparse data and reduce memory usage (Ke et al., 2017). RandomForest and ExtraTrees are two popular ensemble learning methods that enhance model accuracy by integrating multiple decision trees. RandomForest builds each tree by randomly selecting a subset of data points and features, and then consolidates the predictions of all trees through either majority voting or averaging to generate the final prediction (Breiman, 2001). In contrast, ExtraTrees constructs each tree by employing random sub-sampling of both the features and the training data, and applying random thresholds for each feature, leading to the creation of more random and less biased trees (Geurts et al., 2006). Unlike RandomForest, ExtraTrees grows trees to their maximum extent without any pruning, which reduces the model's variance and prevents overfitting. These algorithms are renowned for their efficiency and speed and are often employed in scenarios involving large datasets and high-dimensional data. We also utilize ANN in our study, a popular machine learning technique inspired by the human brain's neural networks (Haykin, 1998). ANN is comprised of multiple interconnected layers of nodes and can learn complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. It has been extensively applied in oceanographic research, with successful applications in the estimation of ocean temperature and salinity structure and prediction of cyclone tracks (Ali et al., 2004, 2007; Meng et al., 2021). The ANN's capacity to model intricate relationships between variables makes it a valuable tool for machine learning tasks, including regression and classification problems. 2.2.2 Ensemble-ML model Fig. 2 illustrates the flowchart of the Ensemble-ML model to estimate the OSTS in the Pacific Ocean. This model comprises two main steps: (1) development of the training, validation, and testing datasets, where sea surface data, including SST, SSS, SSHA, SSW, LON, and LAT, are used as inputs, while Argo data serve as labels; and (2) the model training stage, in which four individual machine learning models (XGBoost, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and LightGBM) are trained to estimate the OSTS of the Pacific Ocean. Then, we combine the four models' outputs using ANN to obtain the final estimation for the Ensemble-ML model. The training dataset is used to train the model, and the validation dataset is used to verify the model's performance during training and to prevent overfitting. The test dataset is used to evaluate the model's finalized performance. Previous studies have shown that an 80\u201320 % split between training and testing in machine learning is a widely accepted convention to learn from data while also preventing model overfitting (Pauthenet et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2022). However, due to data limitations in this study and to facilitate result comparisons, we select monthly averages from January 2010 to December 2019 as the training dataset, with 80 % randomly selected for training and 20 % for validation. The model is evaluated using data from 2020, utilizing metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and determination coefficient (R\u00b2). To prevent overfitting, early stopping and dropout techniques are implemented. We adopt a grid search approach to determine the optimal parameter combinations for each individual machine learning model, as shown in Table 2. The estimated values obtained from each machine learning model are expressed as follows: (1) OSTS XGBoost = F XGBoost SST , SSS , SSHA , SSW , LON , LAT OSTS RandomForest = F RandomForest SST , SSS , SSHA , SSW , LON , LAT OSTS ExtraTrees = F ExtraTrees SST , SSS , SSHA , SSW , LON , LAT OSTS LightGBM = F LightGBM SST , SSS , SSHA , SSW , LON , LAT Where OSTS XGBoost , OSTS RandomForest , OSTS ExtraTrees , OSTS LightGBM are the estimated values obtained from XGBoost, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and LightGBM, respectively, while F XGBoost , F RandomForest , F ExtraTrees , F LightGBM are the model functions for the optimal parameters of XGBoost, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and LightGBM, respectively. The final model results are obtained by calculating the weighted sum of the estimated outputs from four individual machine learning models based on ANN as follows: (2) OSTS estimation = ANN ( OSTS XGBoost , OSTS RandomForest , OSTS ExtraTrees , OSTS LightGBM ) 3 Results 3.1 Comparison between satellite data and argo observations The accuracy and effectiveness of machine learning models depend greatly on the accuracy of input variables. Inaccurate inputs can lead to unreliable model outputs, which hinders progress in the field. Thus, it is crucial to validate input variables to ensure optimal performance. Previous studies have identified SST and SSS as the two most important factors in the estimation of OSTS (Qi et al., 2022; Pauthenet et al., 2022). Therefore, a temporal and spatial comparison was carried out between satellite-derived SST and SSS data and Argo-observed data. Our results reveal a substantial agreement in the seasonal variations of SST between satellite and Argo data. Moreover, the seasonal changes in satellite-derived SSS also exhibit a strong correlation with Argo-derived SSS data, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The correlation coefficients between satellite and Argo data are 0.9951 for SST and 0.9228 for SSS, respectively. These results confirm the accuracy and reliability of satellite-based data, thus validating their suitability for use in machine learning models, such as the Ensemble-ML model we employed. Furthermore, a spatial comparison of long-term averaged (2010\u20132020) SST and SSS derived from satellite and Argo data was conducted ( Fig. 4). The results demonstrate a high consistent spatial distribution of satellite-derived data with Argo-observed data. Both datasets revealed a roughly symmetrical pattern of SST around the equator, with temperature values gradually decreasing from the equatorial Pacific towards both poles. Maximum SST discrepancies were mainly observed in the area near 40\u00b0S and 40\u00b0N, with discrepancies not exceeding 1.2 \u00b0C (Fig. 4c). Similarly, the spatial distribution of SSS derived from satellite and Argo observations exhibited consistent patterns, including the presence of the eastern Pacific salinity front, a high salinity region in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, and a low salinity region in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Overall, these results validate the accuracy and reliability of satellite-derived data, providing crucial support for the estimation of OSTS. 3.2 Comparison of ensemble-ML model with individual models After identifying the optimal combination of parameters, we proceeded to evaluate the performance of the Ensemble-ML model as well as four individual models in the estimation of OSTS in the Pacific in 2020. Fig. 5 shows the vertical distribution of RMSE values, showing an increasing trend from the surface to a maximum around 100\u2013150 m, followed by a subsequent decrease. In contrast, the vertical variation pattern of R2 exhibits distinct differences compared to RMSE. Apart from the XGBoost and ExtraTrees models, the vertical variation of R2 was not significant in other models. Nonetheless, from the surface to a depth of 100\u2013150 m, R2 exhibited a decline trend. Importantly, within the depth range of approximately 100\u2013150 m, the RMSE values were relatively higher, while the R2 values were lower. This trend is likely due to the influence of the thermocline layer, which results in the challenges of accurately estimating the OSTS. Overall, the Ensemble-ML model consistently outperformed the four individual models with lower RMSE values and higher R2 values (Fig. 5). The performance of the Ensemble-ML model and the four individual machine learning models in estimating the OSTS in the Pacific Ocean is summarized in Table 3. The Ensemble-ML model demonstrated superior accuracy, yielding an average RMSE of 0.3273 \u00b0C and an average R\u00b2 of 0.9905, surpassing the performance of the individual models. The LightGBM model exhibited the second-highest overall accuracy, with an average RMSE of 0.3572 \u00b0C and an average R\u00b2 of 0.9894. The RandomForest and ExtraTrees models achieved the third and fourth positions, respectively, with average RMSE and R\u00b2 values of 0.4232 \u00b0C/0.9841 and 0.7408 \u00b0C/0.9508. In contrast, the XGBoost model demonstrated the lowest overall accuracy, with an average RMSE of 0.9046 \u00b0C and an average R\u00b2 of 0.9374. One noteworthy aspect of this study, which distinguishes it from earlier studies, is the incorporation of geographical information as input variables in the Ensemble-ML model. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of including geographical information as an input. To achieve this, two sets of experiments (Cases 1 and 2) were conducted, each using different combination of input parameters ( Table 4). In Case 1, we selected all the input parameters SST, SSS, SSHA, USSW, and VSSW, along with LON and LAT, while in case 2, LON and LAT were not included as input parameters. As shown in Fig. 6, Case 1 yielded significantly lower RMSE and higher R2 values than Case 2 across all depths. For Case 1, the Ensemble-ML model exhibited vertically averaged RMSE and R2 values of 0.3368 \u00b0C and 0.9900, respectively. In contrast, for Case 2, the corresponding values were 0.5012 \u00b0C and 0.9752, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that incorporating geographical information (LAT, LON) as an input greatly improves the precision of OSTS estimation in the Pacific Ocean. This indicates the importance of including geographical information in the estimation of OSTS. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the effectiveness of geographical information could vary depending on the location and spatial resolution of the data. For a detailed explanation of this issue, further research is necessary. 3.3 Evaluation of the ensemble-ML model\u2019s performance Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the Ensemble-ML model's performance in estimating OSTS, examining it from various perspectives. First, we conducted a spatial comparison between the OSTS estimated by the Ensemble-ML model and derived by the Argo at four different depths (50 m, 100 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) in 2020 ( Fig. 7). The results show that the Ensemble-ML model performed well, as the estimated OSTS distribution closely matched the Argo observations at various depths. The Ensemble-ML model successfully captured the key temperature features using sea surface data. At 50 m depth, both the Ensemble-ML model estimated data and Argo-derived data revealed a symmetric distribution around the equator, with temperatures gradually decreasing towards the poles. The western Pacific region exhibited the highest temperatures, exceeding 30 \u00b0C. Relatively large temperature differences between them primarily occurred in the eastern equatorial Pacific region (>1.5 \u00b0C), which can be attributed to the complex circulation structure in this region (Fig. 7a). The complex upwelling system in this region poses challenges in accurately estimating the upper-layer temperature structure using sea surface data. At 100 m depth, there was also a good agreement between the Ensemble-ML model estimated OSTS and Argo observed OSTS. However, we observed slightly larger differences compared to the 50 m depth, ranging primarily from \u2212 0.78 to 0.78 \u00b0C. This difference is mainly related the presence of the thermocline layer at this depth. With increasing depth, the temperature exhibited greater stability. At 500 m depth, the temperature range was confined to 3.92\u201311.16 \u00b0C, indicating relatively small temperature differences, primarily ranging from \u2212 0.33 to 0.36 \u00b0C. At 1000 m depth, the temperature difference was found to be minimal, ranging from \u2212 0.16 to 0.12 \u00b0C. The discrepancies in the estimation process can be ascribed to two sources: errors stemming from data and model. Data errors mainly originate from the limitations associated with observational instruments and the influence of environmental conditions. On the other hand, model errors stem from the intrinsic shortcomings of the Ensemble-ML approach, a statistical method that draws on the interplay between sea surface data and the underlying configuration of ocean structures. The relationship between sea surface data and subsurface temperature structure exhibits considerable variability due to various dynamic processes, including downwelling and upwelling, which results in errors in the estimation model. To further verify the significance of including geographical information in OSTS estimation, we conducted a spatial comparison. This compared the OSTS as estimated by the Ensemble-ML model (which did not use geographical information as input) with the data derived from the Argo observation in 2020, as shown in Fig. 8. While the Ensemble-ML model without considering geographical information can capture most temperature features from sea surface data, it displayed greater errors across various depths compared to the Ensemble-ML that did include geographical data. This further demonstrates the important role of geographical information in OSTS estimation. To provide a more thorough evaluation of the Ensemble-ML model's vertical performance, we selected two representative sections for analysis: a zonal transect (a) along the equator spanning from 150\u00b0E to 80\u00b0W, and a meridional transect (b) along 160\u00b0W from 50\u00b0S to 50\u00b0N, as depicted in Fig. 9. By comparing the OSTS derived from Argo observations with the Ensemble-ML model estimation in these sections ( Fig. 10), we further evaluated the model's accuracy in estimating the vertical structure. The Ensemble-ML model successfully captures the spatial distribution of OSTS and exhibits strong agreement with Argo observations. For the zonal transect (a), both the observed and estimated temperature exhibited a pronounced east-west gradient in the surface layer and thermocline depth, as indicated by the 20 \u00b0C isotherm. Specifically, the thermocline depth is about 50 m in the eastern Equatorial Pacific, compared to over 150 m in the western Equatorial Pacific. The temperature decreased rapidly from the surface down to the thermocline depth, below which it tended to decrease more gradually, reaching a relatively stable range of 3.1\u20137.8 \u00b0C below 500 m. In the upper 150 m, we observed large temperature differences (less than 2 \u00b0C) between 150\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W, with the observed temperature values lower than the estimated temperature values. Similarly, for the meridional transect (b), the Ensemble-ML model accurately reproduces the OSTS and exhibits consistent spatial distribution patterns with the Argo observations. However, relatively large differences (exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C) mainly occurred in the upper layer (50\u2013240 m) of the equatorial region, which can be attributed to the complex circulation system in the equatorial Pacific region. To further assess the vertical performance of the model, we conducted a comparison between temperature profiles estimated by the Ensemble-ML model and Argo profiles in some key regions during 2020 ( Fig. 11). Considering the horizontal distribution features of temperature, we selected four representative regions (Boxes A, B, C, and D) as illustrated in Fig. 9. Box A (150\u2013180\u00b0E and 5\u00b0S\u20135\u00b0N) is located in the western Pacific warm pool, Box B (170\u2013120\u00b0W and 5\u00b0S\u20135\u00b0N) is situated in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region, Box C (135\u2013115\u00b0W and 15\u201325\u00b0S) is in the maximum SSS region of the South Pacific Ocean, and Box D (170\u00b0E\u2013170\u00b0W and 20\u201330\u00b0N) is in the maximum SSS region of the North Pacific Ocean. By selecting these boxes, we were able to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Ensemble-ML model's ability to capture the complex and distinct temperature features in these regions. Our results indicate a good level of agreement between the vertical temperature profiles estimated by the Ensemble-ML model and those observed by Argo in the four selected regions (Fig. 11). The accurate estimation of temperature values in these key regions is also demonstrated by the calculated vertical mean RMSE and R\u00b2 values for each box. The calculated RMSE and R\u00b2 values for Boxes A, B, C, and D were as follows: 0.1867 \u00b0C and 0.9996, 0.1310 \u00b0C and 0.9997, 0.1742 \u00b0C and 0.9995, and 0.2498 \u00b0C and 0.9988, respectively. Correlation density scatterplots were generated to assess the relationship between temperature estimates from the Ensemble-ML model and Argo at various depths ( Fig. 12). The scatterplots demonstrate a good agreement between the temperature estimated by Ensemble-ML model and derived by Argo, with points closely aligned along the line of equal value. The RMSE and R\u00b2 values were computed to assess the agreement between the Argo-observed temperature and the Ensemble-ML model estimated temperature at depths of 50 m, 100 m, 500 m, and 1000 m. At 50 m depth, the RMSE and R\u00b2 values were 0.4540 \u00b0C and 0.9954, respectively. At 100 m depth, the RMSE and R\u00b2 values were 0.5331 \u00b0C and 0.9933, respectively. For 500 m depth, the RMSE and R\u00b2 values were 0.2058 \u00b0C and 0.9835, respectively. At 1000 m depth, the RMSE and R\u00b2 values were 0.0741 \u00b0C and 0.9867, respectively. These results provide additional evidence of the Ensemble-ML model's reliability and accuracy in estimating OSTS in the upper 1000 m of the Pacific Ocean. Although the Ensemble-ML model has demonstrated good performance in estimating OSTS in the Pacific Ocean, its seasonal performance has yet to be evaluated. In the following section, we assessed the model\u2019s performance during four different seasons at different depth levels in 2020. To ensure comparability across depths, we normalized the RMSE values (NRMSE) by dividing them by the range of the monthly temperature range from Argo (defined by the difference between its maximum and minimum values) for each grid and depth. The NRMSE and R\u00b2 values for different seasons at various depths are presented in Fig. 13. We evaluated the model's performance in different seasons, including February (winter), May (spring), August (summer), and November (autumn). The Ensemble-ML model demonstrates good performance across different seasons, as depicted in Fig. 13. The NRMSE values in different seasons exhibited an increasing trend from the surface to about 50\u2013100 m depth, followed by a decreasing trend to about 500\u2013600 m depth, and then an increasing trend to 1000 m depth. The maximum NRMSE value appeared between 50 and 100 m, likely due to the presence of the thermocline layer. Moreover, the accuracy of the Ensemble-ML model generally decreased with increasing depth below 600 m. Estimating phenomena in the deeper layers (below 600 m) becomes more challenging due to their weaker surface manifestations using sea surface data. Moreover, the higher NRMSE values in the upper 100 m may be attributed to the intricate dynamic processes occurring in the upper ocean. As for R\u00b2, its values were generally greater than 0.95 from the surface to 1000 m depth, which also indicates the model's good seasonal performance. Overall, the Ensemble-ML model performs well in OSTS estimation across different seasons, highlighting its reliability and accuracy in the Pacific Ocean. The above discussion evaluates the performance of the Ensemble-ML model for 2020. Naturally, a question arises: How does the Ensemble-ML perform across different years, especially during unique periods like the El Ni\u00f1o phase? To address this, we have conducted a leave-one-out verification experiment. We estimated the OSTS for each year from 2010 to 2020, training the Ensemble-ML model on data from the remaining ten years. For instance, to estimate the 2010 data, we used the dataset spanning 2011\u20132020, whereas the 2011 data estimation obtained from the combined 2010 and 2012\u20132020 datasets, and so on. This methodology provided us with OSTS data for the entire period from 2010 to 2020. Using the estimated data, we calculated the ocean heat content in the upper 200 m of the equatorial Pacific Ocean (between 120\u00b0E to 80\u00b0W and 10\u00b0S to 10\u00b0N), subsequently comparing it with Argo observations. As shown in Fig. 14, the Ensemble-ML's estimation of ocean heat content agrees well with the Argo data, a consistency that persists even during the 2015\u20132016 El Ni\u00f1o event. The correlation coefficient between the Ensemble-ML's estimates and the Argo observations is 0.89 after a 3-month moving average, exceeding the 95 % confidence interval. Such a good agreement between the datasets exhibit the model\u2019s robustness in accurately estimating OSTS and highlights its potential for future research applications. 4 Discussion and conclusions In this study, an Ensemble-ML model was proposed to estimate the OSTS of the Pacific Ocean, utilizing a combination of sea surface data and Argo observations. The Ensemble-ML model combines four machine learning models (ExtraTrees, XGBoost, RandomForest, and LightGBM) to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the OSTS estimation. The model's performance was thoroughly evaluated across various aspects. Satellite-derived SST and SSS data exhibited strong agreement with Argo observations in terms of both spatial and temporal distribution. This validates the suitability of satellite-based data for machine learning models like the Ensemble-ML model. The Ensemble-ML model consistently outperformed the individual machine learning models, achieving the highest level of accuracy in estimating OSTS in the Pacific Ocean with an average RMSE of 0.3273 \u00b0C and an average R\u00b2 of 0.9905. The model's performance further improved when including geographical information as inputs, highlighting the importance of considering spatial context in OSTS estimation. Our evaluation demonstrated that the Ensemble-ML model accurately captured the spatial distribution of OSTS at different depths in the Pacific Ocean, consistently reproducing important temperature features and showing good agreement with Argo observations. Additionally, the model performed well across various seasons and depths, indicating its robustness and potential applicability in a wide range of contexts. One of the major challenges in OSTS estimation is the presence of the thermocline layer, characterized by a rapid change in temperature, which hinders the accurate prediction of subsurface temperature structure. Our results indicated that the Ensemble-ML model's performance was relatively weaker in the thermocline layer, with higher RMSE values and lower R\u00b2 values observed at depths of 100\u2013150 m. Nevertheless, our model still demonstrated a high level of overall accuracy. The complex circulation systems in the equatorial Pacific region, such as upwelling and downwelling processes, pose additional challenges in accurately estimating OSTS. In this study, the Ensemble-ML model exhibited relatively larger discrepancies in this region, especially in the upper layers (50\u2013240 m). However, despite these challenges, the model effectively reproduced the spatial distribution of OSTS and captured the vertical temperature structure in the Pacific Ocean. Errors in the estimation process can be attributed to two main sources: data errors and errors in the estimation model. Data errors primarily stem from observational equipment and environmental conditions, while estimation model errors arise from the inherent limitations of the Ensemble-ML method. Despite the limitations and challenges, the performance of Ensemble-ML model in estimating OSTS in the Pacific Ocean is promising. The Ensemble-ML model could potentially be applied to other ocean basins or regions, although further investigation is required to understand the model's effectiveness in different contexts and regions. In conclusion, this study introduces a novel application of an Ensemble-ML model for accurate estimation of OSTS in the Pacific Ocean using sea surface data. The model demonstrates a high level of accuracy and reliability, effectively capturing the spatial distribution of OSTS and the vertical temperature structure. Our findings indicate the potential of machine learning models, particularly ensemble models, for enhancing OSTS estimation in the Pacific Ocean and other regions, offering valuable insights for future research and applications in physical oceanography. It is worth mentioning that the selection of input variables may not represent the optimal combination, leaving room for further analysis and future research.

It has been well established in the literature that surface contamination can adversely affect the aerodynamic performance of aerofoils and hence the efficiency with which turbines can convert wind to electrical power. Hence it is critical to ensure that turbine blades are kept as free as possible of contaminants. In this manuscript, we discuss LIBS and machine learning techniques on contaminated wind turbine blades with a view to the possibility of integrating these methods into a standoff laser ablation setup in the future. A LIBS signal will be a key step in the decision process, i.e., to determine if a wind turbine blade has been fouled in the first place. Relatedly one must also determine the point at which the laser has adequately removed contaminants from the current Area of Irradiation (AoI) before moving to the adjacent AoI, i.e., interim end-point-detection. For both steps (presence / absence of fouling) we are investigating laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to discriminate clean from fouled wind turbine blade samples. In particular we have performed LIBS in both the Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) and Ultraviolet Visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectral ranges. Analysis of the spectra showed only slight variations in the constituent materials between clean and contaminated blade samples. In order to address this challenge, the efficacy of a number of machine learning and statistical methods for clean versus contaminated blade classification was investigated. Four methods (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Competitive Learning (CL), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)) were evaluated. The spectral regions where machine learning algorithms were applied was determined via a volumetric ellipsoid overlap test based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It was found that SVMs provided the most accurate methodology for binary classification of clean vs contaminated blades whilst also yielding the shortest run time.

Due to the ideal climatology of the island, Ireland is well located to take advantage of the potential that wind energy provides [4,5]. In this respect, maximization of the output energy and extension of the lifespan of wind turbines is critically important from a socio-economic perspective. Previously reported investigations [6\u20139] have highlighted the detrimental effect of contamination on the performance of wind turbines. One inherent complication is the fact that the nature of contaminants present on the blades of a wind turbine depends on the turbine's location. Typical contaminants include organic matter such as insects [10,11], birds, and plant matter, as well as inorganic matter such as soil, sand, ice and dust. In addition, salt contamination [12] plays a key role for turbines installed in maritime environments. The urgent need for a cost-effective, efficient, green and non-hazardous cleaning process, provides the impetus for pursuing alternative solutions to manual cleaning. Currently, we are investigating the possibility of utilising standoff laser ablation as a solution for cleaning wind turbine blades with a view to building a prototype for field deployment. The use of standoff LIBS for material analysis is a well-established application, as shown in e.g., historical architecture [13] and in large scale infrastructure testing such as rust detection on pylons [14]. Laser ablation has been applied extensively, including, but not limited to, investigations regarding archaeological artefacts and paintings [15\u201318], biological materials like tissues [19,20] and other materials (see e.g. review [21]). In a natural extension of this work it is envisaged that the laser ablation process will be used to selectively remove the unknown contaminants that will, in turn, be identified by means of LIBS. The latter is a versatile technique that has found various applications [22], (e.g. in geology [23,24], archaeology [25], pharmaceutical analysis [26,27], environmental analysis [28,29] and materials science [30,31]). Importantly, a closed-loop LIBS configuration [32] has been previously implemented to both monitor and control the process of cleaning the surface of a material. As it offers the significant advantage of online monitoring, this arrangement can be used to track the effectiveness of laser cleaning, via dynamical analysis of the associated plasma plume. In this work, we apply LIBS in both the UV\u2013Vis and the VUV spectral ranges to inspect the surface of wind turbine blade materials. Although VUV LIBS is a purely laboratory based technique, not intended for field deployment, it is utilised in this study as it is particularly advantageous for the detection of light elements [33] (such as carbon and silicon relevant to this study), with excellent limits of detection [34]. In addition, it provides complementary data for input to the machine learning protocols used. On the other hand, working in the UV\u2013Visible part of the spectrum allows for in the field LIBS measurements and the laser itself can be used for in situ cleaning of the wind turbine blades. The latter requires a thorough understanding of the wind turbine blade composition so that the laser parameters for optimal cleaning are established prior to the deployment of the LIBS system. Although a number of LIBS studies on materials mimicking wind turbine blades have been made, especially focused on salt contamination [35,36], to the best of our knowledge LIBS has not yet been applied to explore fouling on decommissioned wind turbine blade surfaces. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the combination of LIBS with machine learning (ML) has not yet been applied to naturally contaminated turbine blades. The main objective of this specific work is simply to show that LIBS combined with ML can be used to distinguish fouled from clean areas on a blade surface. Importantly, this allows for a decision-making loop to be implemented for \u2018end-point-detection\u2019 in any future laser ablation-based blade cleaning system. It also will make any future laser cleaning protocol more efficient by ensuring that cleaning can concentrate only on those blade areas that need attention. To accurately distinguish between clean and contaminated wind turbine blades several statistical and machine-learning techniques have been tested. Machine learning techniques have been widely used in LIBS [37,38]. For example, a combination of artificial neural networks and PCA with LIBS has been used to classify aged epoxy micro\u2013nanocomposites [39]. SVM's have been used with LIBS to analyse coal [40], whereas SVMs in combination with PLS-DA methods have been applied to quantify and classify slag material [41]. Recent studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in combination with LIBS for various applications [26,42\u201345]. However, using machine learning in LIBS applications requires a tailored approach, depending on the specific characteristics of the data and the objective of the analysis. In this work, the development of a scalar metric, provides at-a-glance information on the degree of sample overlapping. This is achieved as follows: Decision boundary surfaces are converted into solid voxelated volumes and the corresponding percentage overlap between the ellipsoids is then computed. The usefulness of a quantitative metric like this, which yields percentage overlap values, is as follows. In spectral regions where a partial ellipsoid overlap results, this metric allows for the preselection of data from those spectral regions where the overlap of ellipsoids is least, thus eliminating qualitative guesswork (e.g., inspection by eye) when evaluating PCA results. The information regarding overlap can then be represented in a concise table, potentially replacing many graphics. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Sample preparation and materials The samples used in this work were obtained from a decommissioned wind turbine blade, shown in Fig. 1 . Specifically, panel (a) shows a photograph of the wind turbine \u2018coupon\u2019. A magnified photograph, focusing on a typical contaminated area of interest is presented in panel (b). Panel (c) illustrates a representative SEM image (obtained using a JEOL JSM-IT100 electron microscope), where the surface details of the contaminated sample can be seen. The final panel (d) shows an example of organic contamination on the micrometre scale (acquired using a Hitachi S5500 Field Emission SEM). Offcuts of the blade coupon were obtained, some of which were cleaned using isopropyl alcohol to yield contaminant free samples. The samples were of dimension 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm with a thickness of 2 mm so that they were essentially flat and hence the inherent curvature of the blades had no discernible effect on the laser focus conditions. This procedure, allowed for a comparison between the clean and contaminated blade samples using LIBS analysis as described below. 2.2 Experimental setups The LIBS experiments were performed using the setups presented in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Blade samples were mounted on a mechanical stage which was moved between laser pulses. This practice ensured that the laser shot irradiated a new area of interest on the sample's surface without overlapping with previous shots. The VUV and UV\u2013Vis spectra were recorded over a period of days from contaminated and cleaned blade samples. The various samples were loaded and aligned at random to avoid bias. For the VUV LIBS experiment, the light source was a plasma formed by focusing the output from a Nd:YAG Continuum Surelite model I-10 laser, delivering pulses of 6 ns duration at a central wavelength of 1064 nm. The maximum pulse energy was 450 mJ at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The energy was controlled by a combination of a half waveplate and a polarizer. The laser beam was focused down to a spot size of approximately 100 \u03bcm by a convex lens of 10 cm focal length. In the VUV experiment the following parameters were used: Pulse energy \u2013 450 mJ, Pulse duration \u2013 8 ns, CCD ungated. Hence the acquisition lasted the entire VUV emitting lifetime of the plasma. we used a high pulse energy in a short duration pulse (8 ns, FWHM) and a focal spot of ca. 100 \u03bcm. Under these experimental conditions, the focused intensity was on the order of 5.6 \u00d7 1012 W.cm\u22122 which will create a hot, and hence a strongly VUV and EUV emitting, plasma. [30,46,47] Spectra were acquired using a 1 m normal incidence spectrometer (Acton Research Corporation VM521\u2122), operated in an off-Rowland circle arrangement and equipped with a 1200 grooves mm\u22121 Al/MgF2 coated grating (Fig. 2(a)). The plasma light passes through a glass capillary array (GCA) and then a through the entrance slit of the spectrometer, operated with a width of 70 \u03bcm, yielding a spectral resolution of 0.065 nm. The registration of the spectra took place via a 2D Andor\u2122 back-illuminated charge-coupled device (CCD). The interaction chamber and the spectrometer were pumped down to a base pressure of ca. 10\u22125 mbar. The laser employed in the UV\u2013Vis experimental setup was a Surelite model SLIII-10 which produces pulses with a duration of 8 ns at the Nd: YAG fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm (Fig. 2(b)). The maximum pulse energy was 800 mJ at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The following parameters were used in the UV\u2013Vis experiment: Pulse energy - 70 mJ, Pulse duration - 10 ns, Time Delay - 600 ns, Gate Width - 1000 ns (600 ns \u22121600 ns after T0). The output pulse train was directed towards the target sample using a series of mirrors and focused onto blade samples using a convex lens of focal length 10 cm down to a spot size of 100 \u03bcm. Radiation from the resulting plasma plume was then imaged onto the spectrometer entrance slit using optics with 2\u00d7 magnification. The setup included a Chromex 500is\u2122, 0.5 m spectrometer with readout provided by an Andor\u2122 DH5H7 intensified CCD (ICCD) camera. The spectrometer was operated with an entrance slit width of 60 \u03bcm providing a spectral resolution of 0.12 nm. The ICCD gate pulse was synchronised with the laser Q-switch trigger pulse so that both the delay to exposure and exposure time (gate delay and width) could be controlled. For both setups, each camera provided a TTL level pulse synchronised to the CCD exposure time (a so-called \u2018Fire\u2019 pulse). This pulse was used to open an \u2018AND\u2019 gate so that the Q-switch could be triggered and the laser output pulse train generated during the CCD exposure time. We note that at high fluences damage by way of pitting can occur on the surface of the blade, although it should be possible to mitigate damage by careful selection of laser parameters. This was the case for VUV spectra where a high temperature plasma was needed. For UV\u2013Vis spectra we could use a much lower fluence and still record usable spectra. However, this particular work aims to identify contaminants and apply machine learning protocols for their classification. Further studies are needed to divine an optimized cleaning regime for turbine blades that mitigates surface damage. The development of an end-point-detection protocol, as envisaged in the work, can help obviate any risk that too high a fluence damages the surface irreparably. 2.3 Machine learning processes For each classification method, 200 clean and 200 contaminated spectra were analysed for both the VUV and UV\u2013Vis LIBS experiments. Preprocessing entailed normalising each spectrum to its own maximum intensity value, prior to training. The maximum in each spectrum (data set) becomes 1 and all other values are scaled relative to it. Normalisation of spectra was employed in pre-processing for machine learning purposes to ensure that all features have the same scale. This is important as the algorthims used for classification, are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Additionally, normalisation helps to reduce the effects of noise and variations in the data, making the model more robust. The 200 spectra were randomly assigned to three sets as follows, 20 for training, 20 for validation, and 160 for testing. Data were randomly sampled, the assumption being that the site chosen experimentally was representative of the surface to be analysed as a whole. Greater sampling of the surface might lead to a more sophisticated model's ability to account for newly presenting non-linear relationships. These relationships could manifest in the form of once-off/infrequently observed features, potentially producing a higher classification accuracy for a CNN which abstracts and learns feature maps encapsulating said nonlinear relationships. On the other hand, it could also result in a lower classification accuracy for the SVM which draws the hyperplane with given parameters. The summary flow diagram for the PLS-DA, SVM and CNN processes is shown in Fig. 3a. The CL algorithm has an alternate process flow illustrated in Fig. 3b. PCA was included in the preprocessing step of the SVM and it was from the principal component space that the hyperplane shown in Fig. 8a was generated. An overarching framework to classify spectra using machine learning was built using Python\u2122 and the following libraries: Numpy, scikitlearn, pandas, matplotlib. Neural networks and deep learning classification frameworks, CL and CNNs respectively, were applied using MATLAB and the Deep Learning Toolbox. 2.3.1 PCA PCA is a statistical technique that aims to preserve significant aspects of the dataset's information, simultaneously reducing its complexity. PCA identifies a set of perpendicular directions known as principal components. The original input data is multiplied by a selection of eigenvectors. Those eigenvectors are sorted by eigenvalue such that the eigenvectors are ordered from most to least variance preserved i.e. the first principal component contains the most variance, the second less and so on. By projecting the original data onto these components, a lower-dimensional representation is obtained, principal component scores were used as x,y,z coordinates for figures. PCA proves valuable in data visualization and feature extraction to its computational efficiency and straightforward implementation. Nonetheless, it is sensitive to data scaling and may only sometimes be the optimal choice for specific data types. [48] 2.3.2 PLS-DA PLS-DA is a supervised machine-learning approach used for classification purposes. It combines Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to derive an effective discriminant function for classification tasks, even when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples. PLS-DA is commonly employed in chemical and biological data analysis and has demonstrated its effectiveness in classification within these domains. In particular PLS-DA involves extracting latent variables that maximize covariance between predictors and response variables. It aims to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that separates different classes. Latent variables are constructed to explain maximum variation in predictors and have a strong association with class labels. The algorithm iteratively identifies latent variables by maximizing covariance, and each variable is a linear combination of predictors weighted by coefficients. PLS-DA captures relevant data structure for discrimination, allowing effective classification of new instances. The model is trained on the training data and used to predict classes for validation and test sets. [49] 2.3.3 SVM SVMs are a set of algorithms that comprise a supervised machine-learning technique used for classification or regression. They are designed to find a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that separates the classes and tries to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the nearest data points [50\u201352]. SVMs typically accept a vector input, in our application this is a PCA dimensionally reduced representation of spectra. However, an SVM's classification is dependent on the kernel and model parameters. If a linear separability is likely then a linear kernel is a good choice due to low run times due to the lower number of parameters. If non-linear behaviour is expected or observed then an RBF (radial basis function) kernel is more suitable [53]. The SVM code implemented here utilizes the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, which, as noted above, is suitable for handling non-linear separability, but at the expense of increased computational complexity. The code also includes optimal parameter values for regularization and the kernel coefficient. The regularization parameter determines the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors. The SVM algorithm solves a convex quadratic optimization problem to find an optimal hyperplane that separates the classes with the maximum margin. This optimization process involves identifying the support vectors, which are the data points closest to the decision boundary. 2.3.4 CL CL is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which can be applied to classification and clustering problems. It involves competition between neurons in a neural network to recognise and classify input patterns. The neuron weights are adjusted to become more sensitive to the features of the recognised patterns and less sensitive to other features. As the process is unsupervised competitive learning can learn to classify patterns without the need fora human to commit time to labelling spectra, thus requiring no labels. However, it can be sensitive to the initialisation of the network and may not always find the optimal solution [54,55]. As applied in this paper the structure of the competitive learning comprises two types of layers, an input layer then a competitive layer. The competitive layer had two neurons, this design was used to configure a binary classifier. 2.3.5 CNN CNNs are deep neural networks that process grid-like data, such as images. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected neurons arranged in a hierarchical fashion, where each layer processes the previous layer's output using learnable filters. CNNs learn local patterns in the data and build up complex features as the data flows through the network, making them effective at image classification and object recognition tasks. They are widely used in various applications but they can require a large amount of data and computational resources to train. CNN's may also be prone to overfitting [56,57]. The structure of the CNN used here consisted of 7 layers which were: an input layer, a 2D convolutional layer, a rectified linear unit layer, a max pooling layer, a fully connected layer, a softmax layer and a classification layer. Differences between all the machine learning techniques can be seen in Table 1 . As seen in Table 1 competitive learning is unsupervised, leaning towards the advantage of not needing labels to train, and thus reducing work needed on the manual preparation side prior to training. CNNs are supervised, requiring labels, they are deep learning and a neural networks application. PLS-DA is a supervised learning method being a direct application of linear mathematics. Support Vector machines are a supervised learning method. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Selection of spectra To identify the most suitable region for machine learning classification, a preliminary PCA was conducted. The spectral range of 25\u2013138 nm in the VUV (Fig. 4 ) was divided into ten sections, which were analysed independently. Similarly, in the UV\u2013Vis range, four regions in the spectral range 238-808 nm (Fig. 5 ) were analysed. Ten clean and ten contaminated spectra were taken for each section. The regions with optimal variance in principal components were identified, and the first three principal components (PC) of each region were plotted in 3-dimensional space. The centre point, represented by the mean of the principal components in a given direction, was determined. Ellipsoids were then generated from the centre point, such that they each contained all points in the clean and contaminated clusters, respectively [58]. The volume of the ellipsoid containing the clean PCA points and the volume of the ellipsoid containing the contaminated PCA points were examined for overlap as a percentage of their volume. In regions where volumetric overlap occurred, this indicated poor separability and was deemed unsuitable for machine learning processing. As a result, only regions with 0% overlap were considered suitable. It was found that all areas of interest, with the exception of the wavelength regions around 40 nm (VUV) and 658 nm (UV\u2013Vis) range, exhibited the highest possible separability. As a result, these regions were excluded from consideration in machine learning operations. Regions with major elemental emission lines were then considered as they provided practical elemental identification as well as suitable input for the application of machine learning protocols. After conducting the initial PCA analysis, the 91\u2013108 nm region was selected for use in machine learning processes as it exhibited the highest degree of separability, but also as it included major atomic emission lines that are favourable for elemental classification of wind turbine contamination and blade composition. Similarly, PCA ellipsoid analysis revealed that, in the UV\u2013visible spectral range, the 238\u2013258 nm region had the highest degree of separability and was a favourable for elemental classification using spectral data from the UV\u2013Vis region. Once the optimal spectral regions were identified, the experimental parameters were optimized and data collection for machine learning was completed. The normalized spectra from the optimal PCA regions are shown in Fig. 6(b), (d). Although a deep dive into the data with a view to determining those aspects of the spectra (e.g., baseline level, individual lines, unresolved transition arrays, etc.) which have the greatest impact on the outcomes of the application of each algorithm, is required, we can state the following. It appears that it is differences in the overall spectral distribution rather than just the baseline levels that the PCA is sensitive to. For example, looking at Fig. 6 one can see that the spectra give rise to good separability in PCA space irrespective of whether baseline differences between clean and contaminated blade sample spectra exist. With cleaned and contaminated data being collected directly from the same system under the same experimental conditions we can deem the results directly comparable. Further meaning the baseline is a feature and not an artifact. As a result, normalisation was the only preprocessing undertaken prior to PCA analysis in order to preserve all spectral features some of which baseline correction techniques may remove. Scree plots (Figs. 7 and 8 ) and Table 2 outlining the variance of each wavlength range displayed in (Figs. 4\u20136). As shown in Fig. 6(a), where a UV\u2013Vis average spectrum of a contaminated wind turbine sample and that of a clean sample are plotted, spectral signatures of atomic carbon and silicon are observed in the wavelength region of interest. In a similar manner, Fig. 6(b) contains spectral signatures of atomic carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, for both the clean and the contaminated sample, in this case for the VUV Spectra. The difference between clean and contaminated spectra can possibly be attributed to the presence of additional material in the contaminated samples, which affects the emission lines and changes the overall shape of the spectra. The corresponding atomic transitions identified in Fig. 6(a) and (b) with the aid of NIST database [59] and are tabulated in Table 3 . 3.2 Machine learning outcomes The results of the analysis using PCA, PLS-DA, and SVM of the UV\u2013Vis spectra are depicted in Fig. 7(a) and (b). These techniques, used here for the analysis of the spectroscopic data, have been shown to be effective in differentiating between groups in a dataset. The plots in Fig. 8 demonstrate the successful application of these techniques in our study, as there is strong separation between the groups in the dataset. This suggests that these techniques are capable of accurately distinguishing between the samples. The algorithms were evaluated based on their accuracy on a labelled sample dataset with a 95% confidence interval definition for classification, the R2 values and the number of misclassified spectra also calculated. The run times for each the algorithms were also calculated and listed in increasing duration. They were as follows: SVM (0.21 s), PLS-DA (0.57 s), CNN (153.9 s) and CL (154.84 s). The run time was defined by the length of time to complete a run through of each algorithm, including the outputs, and the accuracy is defined as the fraction of correct predictions made by a classifier on a dataset. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions made. As displayed in Tables 4 and 5 , it was found that the SVM had the highest accuracy of all the tested algorithms. It also had the fastest run time, taking only 0.21 s to train, test and validate the dataset. In contrast, the CNN had an accuracy of 99.1% (VUV) and 95.9% (UV\u2013Vis) but took significantly longer to train. PLS-DA performed comparably to SVM on both run time and accuracy. Competitive Learning (CL) had the longest run time and the worst accuracy score in the VUV, however it also reached 100% with respect to UV\u2013Vis classification. These results suggest that SVM is the best choice for this classification task due to its high accuracy and fast run time. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we have presented a comparative study of four machine-learning techniques for classifying LIBS spectra of wind turbine blades in both the UV\u2013Vis and VUV. LIBS spectral lines and their corresponding transitions were classified and the optimal spectral regions for machine learning were determined. We found that, in general, the SVM performed best, followed by PLS-DA, the CNN, and then the CL algorithm. The SVM approach showed the highest accuracy and precision, and once projected by PCA with 2 PCs, the LIBS spectra become linearly separable. By applying a SVM with a linear kernel the optimal machine learning technique was selected for the task. The lower run time is explained by this technique being less parametric by comparison to the others. The CNN, PLS-DA, and CL algorithms performed well but were slightly less accurate and took longer to run than the SVM. Overall, our results suggest that the choice of a machine learning algorithm can significantly impact the performance of a LIBS classification task. In particular, the SVM algorithm appears to be a strong choice for characterising binary blade data due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data sets and its excellent performance on various metrics. However, the LIBS data's specific characteristics and the application's requirements should be carefully considered when selecting a machine learning algorithm. Future work will focus on further comparing and evaluating the performance of alternate machine learning algorithms on wind turbine LIBS data, such as self-organising maps or random forests, as well as exploring the use of group methods and other techniques to improve the accuracy and robustness of the models in multivariate analysis. In future addressing the challenges for incorporation of this setup into a portable system for deployment in the field along with comparisons to other laboratory based analytical techniques (e.g. microscopy, SIMS and others) to characterize the blades should be investigated.

An input image is split into patches and embedded with positional information (\u201cpatch tokens\u201d). An extra learnable cls-token is added. All tokens are transformed into a new sequence by a transformer encoder. In a classification setup, an additional simple sub-model (\u201cclassification head\u201d) learns the class based on the transformed cls-token. The illustration is adapted from Dosovitskiy et al. (2020). Fig. 2 High-level comparison between the standard approach for machine learning\u2013based image classification and the method proposed in this work. We use a pre-trained Vision Transformer for the task of feature extraction. The generated CLS token can be seen as the equivalent of CNN embeddings. Since the training of the ViT and the classifier are decoupled, we can use any shallow model for class prediction. Fig. 3 Test accuracies on the CASC IFW data set for different numbers of available training samples. Error bars represent the standard deviation of experimental results w.r.t. random initialization. The ViT approach performs significantly better when training data is scarce. 90% accuracy is reached with three times less training data compared to the best-performing CNNs. Fig. 4 Latent representation of the Fayoum banana ripeness data set in two dimensions (reduced by PCA) for ResNet50 (top-left), VGG-11 (top-right), DINO ViT-S/8 (bottom-left), and DINO ViT-B/8 (bottom-right). All models are pre-trained on ImageNet, and there was no training on the domain data set. The ViT models seem superior in capturing the ordinal property of the four classes. Overlaps between the classes can be traced back to imprecise labeling. Fig. 5 Latent representation of the CASC IFW apple defect data set in one dimension (reduced by PCA) for ResNet50 (top-left), VGG-11 (top-right), DINO ViT-S/8 (bottom-left), and DINO ViT-B/8 (bottom-right). All models are pre-trained on ImageNet, and there was no training on the domain data set. Even though defects are a non-dominant visual feature, there is a notable shift in the distribution of the first PCA component of ViT embeddings, especially for DINO ViT-S/8. Table 1 Test set classification accuracies for both data sets included in this study. We show the results for CNNs ((a) and (b)) and ViTs combined with shallow classifiers ((c) and (d)). All deep models are pretrained on ImageNet. (a) CNN results for the Fayoum banana data set. We report both accuracies when all weights are trained and those when only the dense classification layers are trained. The first and second best scores for each variation are highlighted. (b) CNN results for the CASC IFW apple data set. We report both accuracies when all weights are trained and those when only the dense classification layers are trained.

Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Biomimetic Membranes and Textiles St. Gallen Switzerland Image-based machine learning models can be used to make the sorting and grading of agricultural products more efficient. In many regions, implementing such systems can be difficult due to the lack of centralization and automation of postharvest supply chains. Stakeholders are often too small to specialize in machine learning, and large training data sets are unavailable. We propose a machine learning procedure for images based on pre-trained Vision Transformers. It is easier to implement than the current standard approach of training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as we do not (re-)train deep neural networks. We evaluate our approach based on two data sets for apple defect detection and banana ripeness estimation. Our model achieves a competitive classification accuracy equal to or less than one percent below the best-performing CNN. At the same time, it requires three times fewer training samples to achieve a 90% accuracy. Keywords Machine learning Computer vision Food quality Postharvest Data availability The authors do not have permission to share data. 1 Introduction The automated quality assessment of fruit images by computer vision is commonplace in the postharvest supply chain and is typically used for sorting and grading. Sorting is a selection based on a single attribute, such as size or color. Grading is the classification according to several quality attributes such as color, size, or defects (Abbas et al., 2019). They provide several advantages for packhouse operators and retailers in the food supply chain. First, damaged or off-spec fresh produce is sorted out. Fruits can also be packed better if they are sorted based on size, for example, in trays or boxes. In addition, grading of fruits and vegetables into different categories based on quality at harvest enables producers to sell their produce in different price ranges for the different grades based on consumers\u2019 needs. In case of limited cooling capacity, producers can also choose to store only high-value products in cold storage. Such automated sorting and grading largely replaced manual quality estimation for fresh produce in high-income countries due to its increased efficiency and reduced labor cost. At the same time, algorithm-based solutions establish a common standard for visual inspection and remove human bias (Abbas et al., 2019). Color spectrometers are a direct and precise way to assess color-based fruit properties such as its ripeness level (Alander et al., 2013; Das et al., 2016). However, assessing more complex visual features \u2013 such as surface patterns that correlate with specific defects \u2013 often requires the application of Computer Vision based on RGB images taken with regular cameras. Early approaches rely on image processing and manual feature crafting often combined with shallow machine learning models (e.g. Dubey and Jalal, 2012; Prabha and Kumar, 2015; Piedad et al., 2018; Mazen and Nashat, 2019; Santos Pereira et al., 2018). Khan et al. (2018) combine manual features with deep features from a pre-trained VGG neural network and classify them using a Support Vector Machine. Later approaches directly train neural networks on smaller domain data sets (e.g. Selvaraj et al., 2019; Lopes et al., 2022). Ismail and Malik (2022) achieve excellent classification results for the data sets that are also used in this research by using sophisticated image pre-processing and neural networks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the established approach for machine learning on image data and are used in numerous applications in different fields. Training such a model from scratch is not feasible for most use cases, as it requires a large number of labeled training samples, enhanced computational resources, and extensive experimentation to find the best model setup. Therefore, machine learning practitioners commonly make use of transfer learning: Instead of starting from scratch, one uses a model that is already pre-trained on a large general data set and finetunes it on a smaller domain-specific data set (Ribani and Marengoni, 2019; Saranya et al., 2021). While this procedure reduces the required amount of training data drastically, enhanced computational resources in form of GPUs are still required. Furthermore, the required number of labeled training samples can still be high, especially when the task to learn is difficult. For postharvest sorting and grading applications, retraining can be required for some applications to account for fruit quality differences every harvest season. In summary, CNN-based machine learning for automated sorting and grading requires large labeled image data sets and extensive computational resources in the form of GPUs for (re-)training models. While large centralized fruit sorting lines readily meet these requirements, this does often not apply to regions with decentralized food supply chains where sorting and grading are done manually (Abbas et al., 2019). Supply chains in remote areas or in developing countries can often be characterized by stakeholders that are too small to specialize in high-tech solutions. According to De-Arteaga et al. (2018) this leads to several challenges when implementing machine learning solutions. Three of those directly apply to computer vision for quality assessment in postharvest supply chains: 1. Learning with small data sets: Due to the lack of highly automated sorting lines, images are often sourced by cold-chain operators, for example, with smartphone cameras in a non-standardized way. This naturally limits the sizes of data sets and the quality of the images. 2. Learning from multiple messy data sets: To cover different crops at different ripeness levels, images need to be taken at different times of the season or at different stages in the supply chain. This non-centralized and non-standardized data acquisition creates additional challenges. One must address the risk of introducing unwanted biases when combining data from different sources. 3. Learning with limited computational resources: Farmers, packhouse operators, and retailers are often too small and not specialized enough, so investment into advanced computational resources or cloud services would be worthwhile. By identifying machine learning solutions that can be developed on standard hardware, the barrier to using such technologies can be lowered. This research presents an approach focusing on the issues of \u201csmall data sets\u201d and \u201climited computational resources\u201d. We make use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) that are pre-trained in a self-supervised manner. We use those models as \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d feature generators that translate high-dimensional and unstructured image data into a lower-dimensional domain. Those feature representations (\u201cembeddings\u201d) can then be input to simpler machine learning models, which can be trained with minimal effort on low-cost hardware to perform the desired classification or regression task. In this procedure, there is no need for resource-intensive deep learning on the domain data set, which addresses the issue of limited computational resources. We demonstrate the competitiveness of this approach by benchmarking two different classification tasks for estimating banana ripeness and defective apples, respectively. In addition, we show that our method is superior when only a small amount of labeled training data is available. Therefore, we address the need for learning algorithms that work on limited data. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data sets This study involves data sets that address two types of visual fruit quality attributes. The first is color-based, which often relates to a fruit\u2019s ripeness. Here we target banana fruits. The second is based on local features, such as surface defects or surface spots. These traits indicate, for example, insect damage. Here we target apple fruits. As such, our study includes one representative data set for each of those challenges. The banana ripeness data set from Fayoum University (Mazen and Nashat, 2019) (short: \u201cFayoum Banana\u201d) contains 273 single fruit images of bananas of different ripeness levels with a neutral background. Even though the ripeness degree of a banana is a continuous scale, in reality, farmers and cold store managers grade the fruit using a scale from 1 to 7. The researchers who provided this data set labeled it into four ordinal classes: \u201cgreen\u201d (104 samples), \u201cyellowish-green\u201d (48 samples), \u201cmidripen\u201d (88 samples), and \u201coverripen\u201d (33 samples). However, using ordinal classes naturally leads to edge cases where samples can hardly be objectively associated with one class. Consequently, this leads to a human-induced annotation error. Our own visual examination of the images disclosed possibly inaccurate labels, especially between the yellowish-green and midripen classes. From a machine learning perspective, this classification problem can be considered an easy task since the classification is mainly dependent on the average color values. For apple fruits, the Internal Feeding Worm data set of the Comprehensive Automation for Specialty Crops research project (Li et al., 2009) (short: \u201cCASC IFW\u201d) was used. It contains 5858 images of apples with and without worm defects at the apple surface. Images were taken from four apple cultivars on trees from June to September and, therefore, at different ripeness levels ranging from green to red apples. We use it for binary classification and distinguish between \u201chealthy\u201d (2058 samples) and \u201cdamaged\u201d (3800 samples) fruits. The images have varying lighting conditions and backgrounds. The size and location of the feature of interest \u2013 the damaged spots \u2013 varies. It can be unremarkable and hard to differentiate from the apple\u2019s calyx. For those reasons, this classification problem can be considered an advanced machine learning task. Since we are using pre-trained models, our data sets require preprocessing to match the resolution that was used for pre-training. The CASC IFW images were upsampled from originally 120 \u00d7 120 pixels to 224 \u00d7 224 using bilinear interpolation. The Fayoum Banana images were downsampled to 224 \u00d7 224 pixels keeping the images\u2019 original ratio by applying zero-padding to the height dimension (top and bottom side). Example images for both data sets can be found in the supplementary materials. 2.2 Machine learning with image data Images are a high-dimensional and highly unstructured type of data representation. Traditional (shallow) machine learning models fail to automatically capture the spatial relations of neighboring pixels in an image. Therefore, early approaches rely on extracting hand-crafted features (e.g., color histograms) to make shallow models work with images. However, these approaches are unsuitable for complex tasks and require a lot of manual work by domain experts. In recent years, Deep Learning models, i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been established as the standard approach for image-based machine learning. These models can learn complex patterns in images in a self-reliant way. In simplified terms, a CNN for image classification consists of two high-level building blocks (see Fig. 2, top): 1. A feature extractor \u2013 usually a combination of Convolutional and Pooling layers \u2013 that translates an image into a lower-dimensional representation that is easier to work with for subsequent tasks. This part contains a large number of trainable parameters and requires large data sets to be trained on. In this study, we will use a pre-trained feature extractor. 2. A classifier that uses the latent features to solve the desired downstream task (e.g., finding the most probable affiliation in a given set of classes). It usually consists of one to only a few simple feed-forward layers and is, therefore, fast to train. It is common practice to combine pre-trained feature extractors with untrained classifiers for faster convergence on new machine learning tasks. This concept, called \u201ctransfer learning\u201d accelerates the development of new models significantly. However, the latent features can be hyper-optimized on the task and/or data set the model was pre-trained on. Therefore, to get satisfying results with a new smaller domain data set, one often needs to at least fine-tune the feature extractor\u2019s parameters. In that case, the required training time is still significantly lower compared to training a model from scratch, but advanced computational resources can still be required in the form of GPUs. As detailed below, we can also use pre-trained feature extractors without re-training or fine-tuning, which we target in this work (Ribani and Marengoni, 2019). 2.2.1 Vision transformers In this research, we propose an alternative method for image classification with small data sets. It is built upon a pre-trained Vision Transformer. The Transformer architecture as shown in Fig. 1 was originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) and has been established as the standard method for Natural Language Processing tasks, such as machine translation or text classification. Later variants use attention in a self-supervised way, which enables the use of large unlabeled text corpora as training data (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). Recent advances in computer vision have successfully adapted these models for image data with only small adaptions to the original approach (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2021). Unlike CNNs, transformers can model long-range dependencies and are not limited to local features. Also, they scale well to large network capacities and data sets. Khan et al. (2021) In the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, an input image is split into patches, while each patch is encoded into an embedding representation using a trainable linear projection. These patch embeddings are called \u201ctokens\u201d, and they are the equivalent of words in a natural language context. The sequence of flattened one-dimensional tokens is extended by positional encoding to retain positional information. The key component of the architecture \u2013 the Transformer Encoder \u2013 acts as a sequence-to-sequence translator and, therefore, generates a new output sequence of identical length and shape. The standard approach is to extend the patch tokens by an additional learnable class (\u201ccls\u201d) token. In a supervised classification setup, this token comprises the learned class-related features. This condensed vector is translated to a class label by a simple Multilayer Perceptron 1 1 A feed-forward neural network with a small number of hidden layers. (\u201cclassification head\u201d), equivalent to the classifier in a CNN. The key component in the transformer encoder is the self-attention mechanism. Attention in machine learning describes a method of dynamically weighting inputs based on their actual value instead of weighting them equally. This is realized by adapting the key-query-value concept from retrieval systems. All three components are implemented as vectors and mapped to an output which is the weighted sum of the values. Self-attention in transformers is usually a \u201cscaled dot-product attention\u201d as originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017). It can be calculated as follows, while d k describes the number of key dimensions: (1) Attention ( Q , K , V ) = softmax Q K \u22a4 d k V In practice, it has been shown to be beneficial to apply self-attention multiple times with different query-key\u2013value triplets, which is called \u201cMulti-Head Attention\u201d (Vaswani et al., 2017). 2.2.2 Self-supervised learning of images Self-supervised learning describes a methodology where no external labels are required to train a model, but the training objective is generated from the data itself in the form of a proxy task. In general, this enables training based on large unlabeled data sets. Chen et al. (2021) present an overview study of self-supervised vision transformers. In this work, we use one specific self-supervised learning approach called \u201cDINO\u201d (self distillation with no labels) (Caron et al., 2021). It adapts the concept of knowledge distillation, where a student model is learning from a teacher model. Both models share the same architecture, while the teacher is dynamically created from the exponential moving average of the student\u2019s parameters. During a training step, the two models receive different augmentations of the same input image, while the learning objective is to minimize the divergence of the two outputted probability distributions. As a result, the student model learns the relevant information in an image in a self-supervised way. The DINO framework works particularly well with ViTs but can, in principle, also be applied to other model architectures, such as CNNs. The authors have shown that DINO ViTs explicitly capture the scene layout in the form of object boundaries, which does neither apply to CNNs nor supervised ViTs. Further experiments have shown that their model can achieve competitive classification results on benchmark data sets when combined with simple linear classification models. These properties let us hypothesize that ViTs trained with the DINO method are particularly suitable as feature extractors. While supervised methods might be prone to being hyper-optimized on the task they are trained on, we will evaluate if DINO features are superior in capturing the general task-independent information of an image. In this study, we use pre-trained DINO ViTs as \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d feature generators, which means we use them on domain data sets without retraining or fine-tuning. 2.3 Experimental setup The classification experiments described in this study were implemented using PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) version 1.9.1 and scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) version 0.24.2. To address the robustness of the reported results, all training runs were executed at least five times with different random initialization. For all experiments, we use the same training (64%), validation (16%), and test (20%) splits. To evaluate how different models perform on different data set sizes, we artificially reduced the available training data for some runs by sampling class-balanced subsets from the original data set using weighted random sampling. The validation and the test split stay at their original size in those cases. 2.3.1 Baseline: Convolutional neural networks As a baseline, we evaluate several state-of-research CNNs; all pre-trained on the ImageNet data set (Deng et al., 2009). The models included in this study are VGG-11 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), AlexNet (Krizhevsky, 2014), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), SqueezeNet (Iandola et al., 2016), and four variations of ResNet (He et al., 2016) with different numbers of residual blocks. We use pre-trained weights for the feature extractor block in the CNN, and the classifier is initialized with random weights. Two different types of transfer learning with CNNs were examined: (a) train the whole model on the domain data set, and (b) only train the classifier on the domain data set (see Fig. 2 for reference). We trained with a batch size of 100 samples using Stochastic Gradient Descent as an optimization method. Further, we follow well-established practices when training neural networks: The initial learning rate and momentum are 0.0001 and 0.9, respectively. The learning rate is decreased once the model converges towards its best state: we reduce it by a factor of 10 every time the validation loss does not decrease for 15 subsequent epochs. To avoid overfitting on the training data, training is stopped once the validation loss does not decrease for 30 epochs in a row, while the final model weights are loaded from the checkpoint where convergence started. 2.3.2 Dino ViTs + shallow classifiers Fig. 2 (bottom) shows a high-level overview of our approach compared to the baseline procedure. We use DINO ViTs that are pre-trained on ImageNet as provided by the original authors 2 2 https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino. to generate the CLS token from an image. Different ViT configurations are tested: We test the small (\u201cViT-S\u201d, 21 million parameters, 384 token dimensions) and the base architecture (\u201cViT-B\u201d, 85 million parameters, 768 token dimensions). Both are combined either with an 8 \u00d7 8 or 16 \u00d7 16 pixel patch size. Based on the generated CLS token, we fit a set of the most popular shallow machine learning models for classification tasks. The models included in this study are K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is a small neural network. All of those are classical and well-established techniques in the machine learning community and have been shown to work well on tabular data. 2.4 Visualizing feature embeddings Even though feature embeddings generated by deep learning models have significantly fewer dimensions than the original images, their dimensions are still in the hundreds. To visualize the distribution of samples, we use unsupervised machine learning methods for dimensionality reduction. Those methods aim to decrease the number of dimensions while maintaining the most important information. In this study, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a linear method and UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) from the family of non-linear methods. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Classification results on the full data sets We evaluate the predictive performance of CNNs and our proposed method in classifying the banana fruit images. Table 1a comprises the test set classification accuracies for banana ripeness classification using CNNs. The classification works similarly well, independent of whether the entire model or only the classification layers are trained. This is plausible since the task is comparably simple and mainly color-based. The best classification accuracy for CNNS (0.941) is the same as for the best ViT-based approach (see Table 1c). We hypothesize that even higher accuracies for this data set for both CNN and DINO ViT are prevented by the annotation blur and possibly wrongly labeled data points we described in Section 2.1. It can be assumed that all evaluated approaches can solve the task almost perfectly if labels are accurate. However, having a certain degree of noise and inaccuracy in labels comes with most real-world data sets. Table 1b shows the CNN results for the apple fruit data set. The classification accuracy is significantly higher when training the full model compared to when only training the classification layers. This increased accuracy is likely the case because we are looking for specific and local features in the image which are not captured by the pre-trained model. As shown in Table 1d, the best ViT-based model (a Support Vector Classifier based on DINO ViT-B/8 embeddings) performs less than one percent worse than the best CNN (0.950 vs. 0.958). At the same time, it significantly outperforms CNNs in terms of accuracy, where only the classification layers are trained. These are remarkable results since we did not train the ViT on the domain data set. It shows that the pre-trained DINO ViT can capture domain-specific and local features without having seen comparable images before. Consequently, for advanced classification tasks, DINO ViTs could either achieve similar results with less training effort (compared to fully trained CNNs) or better results with comparable training effort (compared to CNNs where only the classifier is trained). These results evoke the impression that DINO ViT embeddings are generally more accurate than supervised CNN embeddings in capturing the essential features of images when models are pre-trained on general-purpose data sets. To confirm this claim, we ran another set of experiments where we combined the best models from previous results with various pre-trained ViTs and CNNs, including a DINO-trained ResNet-50 for comparison. The results are shown in Table 2. Again, the best accuracies are achieved by DINO ViT-based configurations. This implies that the improved accuracy stems from the feature quality rather than from a possibly superior classifier. It is worth mentioning that previous machine learning research using the same two data sets achieves higher overall accuracies (Ismail and Malik, 2022). The main difference in their approach is sophisticated and highly optimized image pre-processing. We are not benchmarking our results with theirs, as this research focuses on implementation simplicity rather than maxing out predictive performance for the given data sets. 3.2 Classification results with reduced training data The fact that we need to train any deep neural network on our domain data sets to achieve good results naturally leads to the hypothesis that our approach works better on small data sets than CNNs. To test this hypothesis, we chose the best-performing models from previous experiments to examine their performance when training data is scarce. We trained the models on randomly sampled subsets of the training split while the validation and test set stayed constant and were the same as in previous runs. Fig. 3 shows the models\u2019 performances as a function of the available training data using the CASC IFW apple data set. We can observe that DINO ViT-based classifiers perform significantly better on small data sets. A test accuracy higher than 0.9 can be achieved with only 500 samples, while the two CNNs need at least 1500 samples to reach that benchmark. The same experiment for the Fayoum Banana data set can be found in the supplementary materials. However, the results are harder to interpret since downsampling an already very small data set leads to sample sizes where all models perform equally poorly. 3.3 Embedding visualization This section examines the differences between CNN and DINO ViT embeddings by visualizing them in one or two dimensions using dimensionality reduction methods. Subsequently, we only show the results based on PCA. The reader is encouraged to explore visualizations of further principal components and visualizations based on the UMAP algorithm in supplementary materials. It is important to note that dimensionality reduction is done unsupervised, which means that the information on class labels is added a posteriori to the visualizations. As representatives for CNNs, we chose a pre-trained VGG network since it is one of the strongest models for our data sets from previous experiments and ResNet-50 since it is a popular and widely used model. These models are compared to a ViT-S/8 and a ViT-B/8 model. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of banana samples in two dimensions. Although low-dimensional CNN embeddings cluster the classes to a certain degree, there is a substantial overlap between them. A closer look at VGG embeddings shows that the model captures the orientation of bananas in the first PCA dimension and divides them into two classes (negative and positive x). On the other hand, DINO ViT embeddings show a clearer separation of clusters and, at the same time, capture the ordinal character of ripeness classes. The largest overlap exists between the \u201cyellowish green\u201d and the \u201cmidripen\u201d class, which can be traced back to the aforementioned imprecise labeling. One reason for this clear class separation is that there are not many signals in the image apart from the fruit\u2019s color and shape since lighting conditions and background are constant. For reasons of clarity, we only show the distribution of the first principal component of apple image embeddings in Fig. 5. The first principal component of CNN embeddings generates similar distributions for healthy and damaged apples. We hypothesize that more dominant features, such as the fruit\u2019s color, changes in spectra, or background signals, are more salient in low dimensions. Further analysis of the second and third components (see supplementary materials) indicates that local defects are captured there. However, the separation of the classes is rather marginal. In comparison, one can observe a clear distribution shift of the healthy/damaged classes using the first PC of DINO ViT embeddings. This observation allows two possible interpretations: First, DINO ViT embeddings seem more robust against noise, such as lighting and background. Second, these embeddings lead to a higher degree of linearization in the embedding space. In any case, these visualizations support the findings of the classification experiments: DINO ViT features are a superior low-dimensional representation of images compared to CNNs when pre-trained models are being used as off-the-shelf feature generators. 4 Conclusion and outlook We presented a simplified development procedure for image-based machine learning for visual fruit quality assessment. It is particularly suitable for domains with low availability of both data and computational resources. Our main contribution is the facilitation of the development process of the ML model compared to current state-of-research approaches. We show how effective machine learning models can be established with minimal development effort on a standard computer without GPU access. In addition, our approach maintains a high classification accuracy with small training data sets. This can democratize the use of machine learning in decentralized food supply chains. Potential users are cold store operators or companies serving farmer-producer organizations, who often rely on smartphone images for fruit quality assessment. This research contributes towards \u201cGreen AI\u201d which aims to make AI systems more efficient from a computational standpoint and more inclusive for researchers and engineers worldwide by not being dependent on the availability of enhanced computational resources (Schwartz et al., 2020). Future research could focus on validating our findings on more difficult classification tasks. We do not address whether and how far fine-tuning pre-trained Vision Transformers could outperform current state-of-research methods in achieving the highest possible predictive performance. Many food quality applications do not rely on image labels but require the localization and/or quantification of defects. Future studies could address this by adapting the presented approach to object detection or image segmentation tasks. Our visualizations of feature embeddings using PCA underline the high expressiveness of DINO ViT embeddings. This is likely a result of the relevant features of images being largely linearized in the embedding space. This property indicates that DINO ViT embeddings may be particularly suitable for integration with other data sources. One could combine these embeddings (or some principal components) with other data types in a common tabular form. This could be, for instance, sensor or meta data from food supply chains to predict the end quality at arrival.

In doing so, we use a large dataset from 1993 to 2021 with 6550 observations and 138 features and adopt recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence models such as tree-based, boosting and artificial neural network techniques. We find that apart from traditional indicators such as debt and macroeconomic factors; agricultural, energy, health and social factors are strong predictors of an IMF bailout. These factors have hitherto not received much attention in the literature.

Countries that experienced balance of payments (BoP) problems could borrow from the IMF to help stabilize their economies. The IMF functions as the international lender of last resort. Over the years, the Fund has provided financial support to countries experiencing macro fundamental problems through bailout mechanisms. According to Iseringhausen et al. (2019), any member country or government that faces financial trouble, whether low-income, middle-income or rich, can go to the IMF for a bailout. Without a bailout from the IMF in recent times, many of these countries would have struggled to keep their economies afloat due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukraine war. To help overcome BoP challenges and debt crisis, the IMF offers different forms of support such as concessional and non-concessional instruments, surveillance (i.e. policy monitoring and advice), capacity building (in the form of managing public finance and regulatory reforms), and the provision of interest-free loans and other forms of lending facilities. Several studies situated in the context of emerging markets and developing countries, support a positive picture of the likelihood for a country to seek IMF support (Dicks-Mireaux et al., 2000; Dreher and Walter, 2010; Iseringhausen et al., 2019). However, some countries hesitate seeking an IMF bailout because of IMF conditionalities and the negative effects that some countries have suffered after entering into an IMF program (Bird and Rowlands, 2017; Dreher, 2006). For instance, African countries generally had a bitter experience with the IMF due to the painful structural adjustment programs that were implemented in the 1980s and 1990s. Some of these conditionalities included a freeze on public sector employment and wage increases which led to unrest in the labor front, and a freeze or withdrawal in subsidies on food, water, electricity and agriculture. In addition, the IMF has faced massive criticism based on its institutional structure, its level of transparency, and its impact on maintaining the stability of countries that have utilized an IMF program (Dreher, 2006). There is extensive literature that examined the determinants of the likelihood of a country seeking an IMF lending program. For instance, studies have focused on weak economic indicators 2 2 Namely, high debt service ratio, the BoP deficits, low GDP and declining growth rates. (Bird et al., 2004; Ifrah et al., 2021; Iseringhausen et al., 2019); distorted current account balance (Bird and Rowlands, 2017; Joyce, 1992; Knight and Santaella, 1997); and the mismanagement of fiscal and monetary policy instruments (Bird, 2007) \u2013 as the main reasons that force a country to seek an IMF bailout program. In particular, Joyce (1992) use a logit model and find that countries that seek IMF program normally have higher shares of government expenditure, severe current account deficits and smaller reserves. Similarly, Bird et al. (2004) using a Poisson regression model find that repeated users of IMF support have more capital outflows and larger current account deficits. In addition, they also find that these countries normally have lower reserve holdings, investment rates and income per capita. On the other hand, some studies have argued that the credibility of the IMF support program amidst unresolved adjustment policy problems, structural and BoP problems of most participating countries, as well as non-compliance with the conditionality measures are factors that restrain a country from going to the IMF for support (Goldstein and Montiel, 2017; Przeworski and Vreeland, 2000). For instance, Przeworski and Vreeland (2000) use the Heckman selection model and find that most countries seek the IMF program because of foreign reserves crisis. The study also find that countries that stay in the program experience low economic growth. Earlier studies also find no evidence that the IMF program improved balance of payments (Connors, 1979; Reichmann and Stillson, 1978), even though some studies find some improvements (Bird, 1996). Despite these conflicting evidence, countries repeatedly seek for an IMF bailout. The question therefore remains as to: why do countries seek an IMF bailout? The world has seen some of the worst global conditions in recent decades. The COVID-19 pandemic, rising global interest rates, record high inflation rates, the strengthening of the US dollar has posed challenges for many economies. Especially for low-income countries in Africa, there has been an intense debate as to whether countries should seek support from the IMF to secure their ailing economies as a result of these global conditions. Due to their poor economic performance, most of these economies have had credit downgrades and are unable to access international capital markets. Despite these challenges, the political will to seek help from the Fund is a major consideration given the perceived negative political capital for incumbent governments; this usually affects the timing with which these countries seek for help. However, forces beyond a country\u2019s control may force it to seek an IMF bailout. Therefore, this study seeks to understand the factors that lead countries to seek support from the IMF. This is important especially for policy makers because knowledge of these existing factors can help them decide the appropriate timing to seek for assistance. Going too late for assistance may worsen the existing economic conditions of the country. This may prolong the time to have an agreement with the Fund or not have the desired agreement or in a worse-case scenario not get an agreement. Indeed, when the economic conditions are worse, the IMF may impose some strict conditions in a bid to have some stability in the Fund\u2019s financial resources. Our study is, therefore, important to help identify the key factors that leads countries to seek for IMF support. Our main contribution lies in the use of new techniques that are better at predicting outcome variables. Specifically, we use machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models such as tree-based, boosting and neural network techniques. The advantages of these models compared to traditional estimation techniques are that: (i) whether a country seeks an IMF bailout is probabilistic in nature and is a prediction problem which machine learning and artificial intelligence models are better at compared to traditional econometric methods (see Amini et al. (2021)); (ii) ML and AI models can detect non-linearities in the dataset without being explicitly programmed to do so (see Amini et al. (2021) and Gu et al. (2020)). Indeed, many of the variables such as a country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio, foreign currency reserve, BoP, inflation, interest rate and oil price may change in a non-linear fashion in relation to the probability of seeking IMF support and may also interact in unpredictable ways when a country is in financial distress. Thus, our approach allows us to identify and untangle the complex, high-dimensional, and interactive effects that exist between the features that predict a country seeking IMF support. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset and presents the methodology used in this study. Section 3 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Section 4 concludes. 2 Data and methodology 2.1 Data The data for the different types of programs accessed by IMF member countries was obtained from the IMF. The sample period is from 1993 to 2021. We obtained the other features (variables) from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and Bertelsmann Stiftung over the same time period. 3 3 The detailed sources of the data and the list of countries are reported in Tables A.1 and A.2 in the Appendix, respectively. Given that the number of years that a country seeks an IMF bailout represents a small proportion of the sample, we use sample overweighting and underweighting approaches in an attempt to improve the predictability of our algorithms. Specifically, we used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) which allows us to overweight the minority class (IMF bailouts). We also explore underweighting techniques such as the RandomUnderSampler from imblearn. 2.1.1 Train/validation/test data split We split the data into train, validation and test sets to enable us judge the performance of our machine learning models on unseen or test data. We employ a Train/Validation/Test ratio split of 60/20/20. In addition, we perform Cross Validation using the K -Folds method and a K of 10 on the training data. Consequently, the training data is split into 10. The artificial intelligence/machine learning models trained or learnt on 9( K \u22121) folds of the data and evaluated performance on 1. Thus, instead of 1 performance metric, we had K or 10 metrics. High cross validation scores are an indication that our models will perform well on unseen data, are stable and have low variance. 2.1.2 Data pre-processing We perform outlier treatment for all the variables in our data set. We first of all compute the inter-quartile range (IQR). The first quartile is represented by the 25th percentile and the third quartile is represented by the 75th percentile. We remove values that are 1.5 times outside this range. We also treated for missing values in the data set using the median filler. 2.2 Machine learning algorithms We adopt various machine learning algorithms to predict the factors that explain why countries seek an IMF Bailout. The algorithms include Logistic Regressions, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks. Our model selection is based on the models that have the highest Recall score, the models that are consistent based on the other evaluation metrics (mainly Precision and the F1 scores), and finally based on models that have the least over-fitting. Machine learning models are known to quickly overfit the data. The consequence of overfitting are that the machine learning models perform extremely well on the training data but have lower performance on unseen data or test data. 2.2.1 Hyper-parameter tuning We select the final models for our prediction after tuning the models. Tuning is important to boost the predictability of our models. Hyper-parameter tuning represents the process of trying to improve the performance of our machine learning models by searching for the best parameters. These parameters cannot be learned from the data and are specified by the programmer. We tune parameters such as the learning rate, the number of estimators, the tree depth, max features, maximum sample size, gamma, scale pos weight, the number of neurons and dropout rates. 2.2.2 Model performance evaluation We use the confusion matrix to help us evaluate the performance of our algorithms. The confusion matrix gives us the number of True Positives, 4 4 This represents our prediction of those who would take an IMF bailout and actually did. True Negatives, 5 5 This represents our prediction of countries who would not take an IMF bailout and indeed they did not seek a bailout. False Positives 6 6 This represents our prediction of countries those who would seek a bailout but they did not. and False Negatives. 7 7 This represents our prediction of those who would not seek a bailout but actually did. Based on the metrics from the confusion matrix, we compute the Accuracy ratio, the Recall Score, the Precision Score and the F1 Score. We measure the performance of our models using the Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1 Score. We do not rely on the Accuracy Score because the data set is imbalanced. The Recall score tells us the percentage of actual IMF bailouts that we are able to predict. Recall is defined as: (1) Recall = True Positive True Positive + False Negative The Precision Score on the other hand tells us what percentage of our predictions of countries going to the IMF are actually correct. Precision is defined as: (2) Precision = True Positive True Positive + False Positive Finally, we examine the F1 Score which is a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. The F1 score is defined as: (3) F1 = 2 \u00d7 Precision \u00d7 Recall Precision + Recall The F1 score ranges between zero and one. A value of one represents perfect recall and prediction. 2.2.3 Feature importances Finally, we examine the feature importances that the machine learning algorithms suggest are important for predicting a country seeking an IMF bailout. The feature importances are a ranking of the features (independent variables) that the machine learning algorithms identify as explaining an IMF bailout. Due to the fact that the algorithms provide a ranking of the features, we are able to determine most important factors that explain why countries seek an IMF bailout. 3 Results and discussion In this section, we present the results from our empirical experiments. We first present information on the characteristics of the data at our disposal. This is followed by results from our model building. We then present results from our hyperparameter tuning which is aimed at improving model by searching for the best parameters. Finally, we present and discuss the results from the feature importances. 3.1 Data characteristics Fig. 1 shows that for the entire data (6550 observations and 138 features), 25% of country years represented years in which countries were in an IMF programme. On the other hand, 75% of country years (4880 observations) represented years in which countries were not in an IMF programme. Consequently, we have a clear class imbalance in our dataset. This provides strong support for our use of class imbalance techniques. Table 1 shows the data we have in the training, validation and training data set. The class distribution on the training, validation and test data are also quite similar and similar to the overall distribution of 75%/25% in the overall data. 3.2 Model building Fig. 2 presents results from using the original data. The original data does not include a treatment for class imbalance. We see that Random Forest produces the highest cross validation (CV) score whilst Ada Boost produces the lowest CV score. The performance across the models are similar but mostly below a CV of 80%. Using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data by increasing the size of the minority class (IMF programme years), in Fig. 3 we see an improved performance (higher CV scores) compared to the original data. Here as well, Random Forest has the highest CV score whilst Adaboost has the lowest CV score. Most of the CV scores are above 90%. Using the Random UnderSampler from imblearn to balance the data by decreasing the size of the majority class (non-IMF programme years), in Fig. 4 we see an improved performance (higher CV scores) compared to the original data. Logistic Regression has the highest CV score whilst Adaboost has the lowest CV score. However, we observe that the performance using over-sampling is better than using under-sampling. Consequently, we performing hyper-parameter tuning using the over-sampled data. 3.3 Hyper-parameter tuning: best parameters Table 2 shows the best parameters for our machine learning algorithms. These parameters are the ones we used in estimating our algorithms. Fig. 5 shows the evaluation metrics after running these models. We settle on the Random Forest because it has some of the highest evaluation metrics and is stable and consistent across both the validation and test data. The feature importances are therefore based on the Random Forest. 3.4 Features importances Fig. 6 shows the feature importances based on the Random Forest classifier. Fig. 6 displays the top 25 factors that predict an IMF bailout. Taking an IMF non concessionary loans is the biggest factor predicting an IMF bailout. This is followed by exchange rate movements, broad money, contributing family workers, and long-term external debt to GDP. To help us explain the feature importances, we group the top features into various categories and examine whether the feature is high or low in a programme and non-programme year. From Tables 3 and 4 we see that IMF bailouts are associated with low financial development. In addition, financial market volatility, represented by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), is a strong predictor of an IMF bailout or programme. In terms of macro factors, as expected, high debts and low reserves predict an IMF bailout. Interestingly, accessing IMF loans (both concessional and non-concessional) are strong predictors of a bailout. This suggests that some countries become regular \u201ccustomers\u201d of the IMF. Furthermore, high inflation and interest rates are associated with a higher likelihood of a bailout. High unemployment is also associated with IMF bailouts. In addition, countries that rely heavily on grants and remittances are more likely to need an IMF bailout. Corruption, low government expenditures and high income inequality are also associated with a higher likelihood of an IMF bailout. From Table 5, we find that agricultural, energy and trade factors are associated with an IMF Bailout. In particular, high levels of agriculture and low information and communications technology (ICT) exports are predictive of a bailout. Low energy consumption and high natural resource rents are also found to be predictive of a bailout. Energy consumption is an indicator of economic activities and thus we observe low energy consumption in bailout years. In addition, the association between high natural resources and a bailout is suggestive of a natural resource curse. In terms of trade factors, high levels of international trade taxes and import duties are shown to be predictive factors of a bailout or IMF programme. From Table 6, we observe that the quality of healthcare is a strong predictor of a bailout. For instance, the levels of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria are all associated with a bailout. Furthermore, the life expectancy is found to be a strong predictor of a bailout. In addition, sanitation, the quality of drinking water, the number of women in parliament and high age dependency are found to be associated with a bailout. 4 Conclusion Using a large data set (6550 observations and 138 features) and employing recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we contribute to the debate as to the factors that predict the likelihood of a country needing an IMF bailout. Our study uncovers many factors that can predict why a country seeks an IMF Bailout. These factors include traditional factors such as high levels of external debt, unemployment, financial market volatility, foreign exchange reserves, tax policy and so on. We also uncover new factors such as the structure of the economy (agrarian), energy factors, trade factors, health related factors, and social factors. Though these factors have not been employed in the extant literature, we find that they are useful at least in a predictive sense in identifying countries that are likely to need an IMF bailout. Overall, our findings suggest that low financial development, high financial market volatility, high levels of debt, poor government quality (e.g. corruption, unemployment, income inequality), high levels of agriculture, services such as ICT imports, poor health services quality, and social factors such as poor sanitation, access to clean water, and gender diversity are strong predictors of a bailout. In addition, accessing previous funds from the IMF (whether concessionary or not) is found to be a strong predictor of a bailout. This suggests that countries become \u201cregular\u201d customers of the IMF. Our work contributes to the financial fragility literature as it provides a way of identifying countries that are vulnerable and may need an IMF bailout. It also provides development financial institutions (DFIs) and countries with a framework to monitor the financial health of countries and pointers or levers to improve their financial resilience and reduce the probability of financial distress or needing an IMF bailout.

Dept.of Computer Applications BSAR Crescent Institute of Science and Technology Chennai India Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a big problem for cyber security because they can cause a lot of damage to both people and companies. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have been seen to do a lot of damage to the networks and devices they are aimed at. These hacks slow down networks and use up buffer space, which makes resources unavailable. To solve this problem, \u201cSupervised Machine Learning Models\u201d have been used. Several machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression, were used to figure out what was normal and what was an attack. This study used a sample of the CSE-CICIDS2018, CSE-CICIDS2017, and CICDoS datasets. The dataset was divided into two parts in which three fourth of the data was used for training and one fourth of the data for testing purpose. The proposed research attempt to classify the DDoS attack by using supervised machine learning classifiers. This approach employs three machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, KNN and Logistic regression. Then we perform Feature Scaling by using Standard Scaler. Finally, the system was evaluated. Random forest classifier outperformed other classifiers with an accuracy of 97.6 % whereas KNN and Logistic regression achieved 97 % and 91.1 %. The study employed several Supervised Machine Learning techniques, including Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression to identify the most effective algorithm for the test. Results demonstrate that Random Forest outperformed the other models.

These attacks pose a significant threat to the Internet. Cybercriminals employ DDoS attacks as powerful weapons, bombarding the victim's network with an immense number of packets. This depletes resources, slows down the service, and prevents legitimate users from accessing it. With the growing number of internet users, these attacks have increased in frequency. They not only block access to services for legitimate users but also result in substantial financial losses. DDoS attacks, which use IP spoofing to complicate request handling and hinder proper operation for genuine users, are the most common form of distributed network attacks. Web applications and commercial websites often become targets of these attacks, which can serve various malicious purposes [1]. DDoS attacks are caused by traditional networking devices' limitations. The ever-growing array of tools and techniques has elevated DDoS attacks to become one of the most significant challenges when it comes to identification and detection. Effectively mitigating DDoS attacks involves the implementation of a comprehensive security policy, deployment of intrusion detection systems, and utilization of firewalls (see Tables 1\u20134 , Figs. 3, 4, 8\u201314). DDoS attacks are malevolent attempts aimed at overload a network or website. These assaults present a substantial peril to the stability of the Internet. They involve inundating a network with traffic from numerous origins, thereby exposing users to vulnerabilities. The increased popularity and simplicity of One of the biggest Internet security threats is DDoS attacks. Various machine learning methods have been devised to reduce such threats. In Fig. 1 , the depicted scenario showcases a DDOS attack where an assailant bombards the victim server with botnet attacks, resulting in network disruption. The rapid digitalization of transactions, such as online purchases, testing, e-commerce, online banking, and data transmission, has shifted the majority of activities from the physical realm to online platforms, thanks to technological advancements [2\u20135]. The widespread usage of mobile phones enables individuals to participate in this global network, conducting transactions at any time and from any location. However, this digitization also attracts malicious intruders who exploit the Internet's veil of anonymity to pilfer data, money, and disrupt network services. The three primary types of DDoS attacks include application-level attacks, protocol-level attacks, and volumetric attacks [6,7] (see Fig. 2). Among these algorithms, A-Means and C4.5 hold prominence, each serving distinct purposes [8]. A-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm employed to group network traffic data, thereby discerning patterns of normal behaviour and segregating them from anomalous behaviour that may indicate a DDoS attack. Conversely, C4.5 can be utilized to construct a decision tree model that classifies data traffic as either normal or indicative of a DDoS attack [9\u201311]. While K-Means is commonly utilized for exploratory data analysis, C4.5 is more suitable when the target variable is categorical. C4.5 can be integrated into a comprehensive DDoS attack detection system; however, it may possess limitations and should be combined with other techniques and algorithms for effective detection and in our research, we have employed various supervised machine learning algorithms to identify DDoS attacks, evaluating their performance based on accuracy and the Confusion Matrix, considering the severity and increasing frequency of these attacks. To determine the optimal characteristics for DDoS detection, our approach combines supervised learning methodologies with feature selection techniques. Recognizing the serious threat posed by DDoS attacks, we propose a supervised machine learning strategy that integrates different algorithms to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of DDoS detection. 1.1 Motivation The motivation for research on DDoS attacks using supervised learning is to augment the efficiency of detecting these attacks in real time. Additionally, with the increasing sophistication of DDoS attacks, traditional methods of detecting them may not be effective and consequently, the use of machine learning provides a promising alternative result. This method is tested using real-world data. The below table depicts the various DDoS attack techniques and its defence approaches. The various DDoS defence approaches are classified in the table below. 1.2 Current state of art in DDoS defense Present state of the art in DDoS defense involves several key approaches, including Machine learning in DDoS attacks. Machine learning is a rapidly growing area of investigation and development in the ground of DDoS attack defense. Machine learning algorithms can be benefit able in several ways to improve DDoS defense including: 1.3 Objective of research The primary aim of this study is to investigate the substantial risk presented by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assaults within the domain of cybersecurity, which can have profound consequences for both individuals and entities. DDoS attacks have the capacity to damage target networks and devices through the implementation of overwhelming traffic, resulting in network slowdowns and buffer overflows. Consequently, these assaults render vital resources inaccessible. In order to address this potential risk, the study suggests the adoption of a Supervised Machine Learning framework. 2 Literature survey Here in this section, we analyze a range of research works done in this field to detect and classify DDoS attacks. To lessen the effects of DDoS attacks [1], created an algorithmic system built on C.4.5 for detecting them. This approach, when used in conjunction with signature detection methods, produces a decision tree that can be used to automatically and effectively detect signatures assaults used in DDoS floods. The authors have chosen an additional machine learning method and compared the results to verify the accuracy of this system. To detect and track network attacks, the authors trained a recurrent deep neural network on sequences of network traffic. The experimental outcomes show that this model outperforms the modern models for machine learning. In the larger dataset, they have lowered Compared to the conventional machine learning technique, the error rate decreased from 7.517 % to 2.103 % [12]. This study offers ArOMA, an autonomic DDoS defence system that uses SDN's programmability and centralization. ArOMA can automate allowing humans from difficult interventions through traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and mitigation. By logically spreading security functions, it allows ISPs to manage DDoS traffic in accordance with client demands. The experiments show that ArOMA can maintain video stream performance during DDoS flooding attacks [6]. In this research, the authors have analysed Mirai's seven-month expansion to 600k infections and its DDoS victims. They have also analysed a variety of measuring vantage points were used to examine how the botnet came into existence, what devices were impacted, and how Mirai versions changed and vied for vulnerable hosts. The measurements show how vulnerable the IoT ecosystem is. The authors suggested technological and nontechnical actions and future research to mitigate this danger [13]. DGA-based botnets are hard to detect and survive because to their stealth. This work presents DBod, a DNS query behavior-based DGA-based botnet detection system. The suggested approach leverages the fact all hosts with the same DGA-based malware infection do the same domain list queries, most of which are unsuccessful. The proposed method is tested using 26-month DNS data from an educational network. In actual networks, DBod successfully recognises both recognised and unrecognised DGA-based botnet patterns [14]. This article introduces Zombie Coin, a Bitcoin-based botnet C&C method. Zombie Coin has several advantages over current C&C systems, including its resistance to takedown efforts and regulatory processes. The authors outlined how the Bitcoin network's cutting-edge C&C tools, such as flexible rendezvous scheduling, effective botnet segmentation, and fine-grained bot control, significantly increase this risk. Zombie Coin bots deployed and controlled through the Bitcoin network prove our claims. We predict botmasters will soon seek Bitcoin-based C&C solutions. The authors aims that this research would help develop effective countermeasures for this menace [15]. This work introduces a unique flow-table sharing strategy to protect SDN-based clouds from flow table overloading DDoS attacks. The switch's flow-table is protected from overloading by using other OpenFlow switches' idle flow-tables. This solution boosts cloud system DDoS resilience with minimal SDN controller participation. Thus, communication overhead is low. Extensive simulations support the authors claims [16]. This research provides a Fuzzy self-organising the ideal solution for enhancing SDN capabilities in cloud computing is maps based DDOS mitigation (FSOMDM). FSOMDM substitutes Kohonen neurons with fuzzy rules. This approach uses software-oriented traffic analysis and the fuzzy rule to explore input space and create a single-valued output for DDoS mitigation. FSOMDM's attack-response process drops attack flows in SDN's control plane. FSOMDM improves true positive rate (TPR) classifier accuracy by about 94 % [17]. This work introduces a structure analysis-based system to categorize botnets and benign applications utilizing traits and patterns linked to the characteristics of botnets. In real-world benchmark datasets, the chosen patterns exhibit strong detection accuracy. The SVM classifier outperforms other classification algorithms in experimental and statistical tests [18]. This work proposes a mathematical a DDoS attack model. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms recognise assaults and typical scenarios. Experiments use CAIDA 2007 dataset. This dataset trains and validates machine learning methods. This study implements Weka data mining platform and compares findings. Comparing denial of service attack machine learning techniques with the existing work [19]. Current intrusion detection technologies are unlikely to stop advanced botnet techniques. A botnet traffic analyzer built on deep learning is called Botnet Traffic Shark (BoTShark). BoTShark employs It can handle encrypted payloads since it just handles network transactions and is not dependent on deep packet inspection. This enables us to extract new features from each layer of an autoencoder or cascading convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and uncover connections between the original properties. The authors forecast fraudulent traffic using a Softmax classifier [20]. 3 Proposed model The aim of this research work is to build a framework which can classify and predict DDoS attacks using ML techniques. This framework consists of six steps which include Selecting a suitable dataset, choosing appropriate tools and programming languages, pre-processing the data to eradicate useless information and scale the features, and to visualize the data to gain insights, splitting the data into training and testing sets, building the model, and evaluating it. Machine Learning algorithms named KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regrssion have been used for detecting ddos attack and benign scenarios. 3.1 Data set The dataset used in this study, is a subsample of the CSE\u2013CIC\u2013IDS2018, CICIDS2017, and CICDoS databases (2017). The CSE\u2013CIC\u2013IDS2018, CICID2017, and CICIDS2017 datasets are commonly applied in the thrust of network security to perform intrusion detection and network traffic analysis. Seven columns and 500,000 rows make up this dataset. It has 80 % benign traffic and 20 % DDoS traffic. This dataset contains various features that describe DDoS attacks, including the Timestamp, Forward Pkt Len Mean, Forward Seg Size Avg, Init Fwd Win Bytes, Init backward Win Bytes, Forward Seg Size Min, and the label indicating the type of attack. 3.2 Data pre-processing In this step, raw network-traffic data is processed and transformed into a pattern that is suitable for analysis by machine learning algorithms. Initially, we checked whether the obtained datasets contain any missing values or not. From the below chart, we can conclude that there are no missing values. X-axis depicts the name of the columns of the data set whereas the y-axis depicts the count of the variables. The sum of rows in the dataset is 5,00000 and seven columns. Statistical techniques is applied to identify and replace irrelevant values in the data. Using the python library \u201cmissingno\u201d, we visualized the presence and distribution of missing data in the dataframe. The barplot from missingno showed the extent of missing values and their correlation. 3.2.1 Checking for null values The dataset was checked to know whether the data contain any null values or not. We used isnull() function for this and the results showed that the dataset is free from null values. 3.2.2 Checking for Missing values Missing values were checked using missingno library and the result can be seen in figure which shows that there are no missing values in the dataset. Using the python library \u201cmissingno\u201d, we visualized the presence and distribution of missing data in the dataframe. The barplot from missingno showed the extent of missing values and their correlation. 3.2.3 Sorting the dataset After this we sorted the data using the Timestamp attribute, then the Timestamp column was dropped as it is just a digital record of the time of occurrence of the event and it does not have any impact on the independent variable. 3.2.4 Normalization In machine learning, feature scaling is used to normalize the distribution of independent variables in a dataset. To prevent some features from overwhelming others due to their scale, feature scaling aims to put all features on an equal scale. As a result, some machine learning algorithms perform better. We have used the Min-Max normalization technique to perform Feature Scaling where the values are transformed so that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the standard deviation is 1. The result is a normalized distribution which makes it simpler to interpret the relationships among variables. The KNN algorithm, which uses the Euclidean distance as a metric to calculate similarities, can be sensitive to the scale of the features. If some features have a much larger scale than others, the Euclidean distance can be dominated by those larger-scaled features, leading to the suboptimal performance of the algorithm. To address this issue, we have performed feature scaling. 3.3 Data visualization The representation of data in the form of images or diagrams makes it easier to comprehend and understand the information. To understand and explore the relationships between attributes in the dataset, we employed data visualization using the Seaborn library. We started by creating a heatmap as shown in Figure which presents the data in 2-dimensional color maps utilizing variations in hue, saturation, and luminance. Instead of numbers, heatmaps depict the relationship between variables through colors, with the variables plotted on both axes. The change in color intensity in a particular block represents the relationship between two values. Fig. 6 represents the heat map which is used for data visualization to show the relationship between two or more variables in a matrix format (see Fig. 5). The color of each cell of the matrix exhibits the level of accordance among the attributes, with warm colors indicating a higher relationship with each other and cool colors indicating a low relationship. The correlation matrix is converted into color labeling via the heat map. In this specific case, the corr_matrix represents the pairwise correlations between numerical columns in the DataFrame \u2018df\u2019. The code sets the size of the figure for the heatmap and customizes its appearance. The heatmap itself is created using Seaborn's sns.heatmap() function. To enhance visibility, the annot_kws parameter is used to increase the font size of these annotations to 14. The color palette for the heatmap is set to \u2018coolwarm\u2019, which provides a spectrum of colors ranging from cool (blue) to warm (red), making it easier to interpret positive and negative correlations (see Fig. 7). Count plot shows the distribution of the classes present in the label column. The figure shows that the ddos contains 100,000 values whereas Benign contains 400,000 values. We have used a pie chart which represents the percentage of Bening & DDoS attacks which shows 80 % of benign attacks and 20 % of DDoS attacks. 3.4 Handling class imbalance Ensuring a balanced distribution of classes within a dataset is crucial, particularly in situations when there is a substantial class imbalance. For instance, in the case where there are only 100,000 DDOS records compared to 400,000 innocuous records, achieving class balance is necessary to promote equitable and efficient training and performance of machine learning models. The presence of class imbalance might potentially introduce bias, distort outcomes, and adversely impact the generalizability of the model. These concerns can be mitigated by implementing techniques such as under sampling the dominant class. Under sampling is a technique employed to mitigate the issue of models excessively prioritizing the majority class, thereby enhancing the performance pertaining to the minority class. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where the minority class holds significant importance. Moreover, the presence of balanced classes contributes to enhanced model interpretability and equitable evaluation, hence yielding outcomes that are more dependable and significant. 3.5 Data splitting and applying different models We have categorized the dataset into two groups: independent and dependent. The target class is another name for the dependent class. Classes that are independent of other classes are referred to as independent classes. For our proposed model, we have partitioned the dataset. To train and test the dataset for evaluation, we have utilized the sklearn model selection library for data splitting. In this research, we have split the data set into two parts the first part which is of 80 % is used for training and the remaining 20 % is used for testing the data. Three different models have been used those are Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Logistic Regression. 3.5.1 Random forest Many different trees make up the forest. In the random forest, it has been found that there is no correlation among the decision trees. When a fresh sample input enters the forest after it has been created, the decision trees in the forest will make judgments and decide the sample category based on the decision. A decision tree is used as the classifier in RF, which combines the positive aspects of the random subspace technique and the bagging algorithm. Only a portion of the samples is chosen for inclusion in training sets when the Bagging algorithm is employed for sampling without replacement during training. Decision tree voting is used to determine the outcome. 3.5.2 K- nearest neighbor A Machine Learning method named K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is used to classify depending on the mass of their nearest neighbors when the nearest neighbor coverage is set to k. k value of 5 was selected. This choice was made with several considerations in mind. First, setting k to 5 aims to balance the trade-off between bias and variance. Smaller k values increase sensitivity to noise and may lead to overfitting, while larger k values introduce more smoothing and potential bias. Additionally, an odd k value was chosen to avoid ties in the decision-making process. The selection of k = 5 is a common starting point for many datasets, providing a reasonable balance between capturing local patterns and generalizing well. An odd k parameter in the KNN algorithm has various benefits. First and importantly, it prevents vote ties, ensuring a clear majority among nearest neighbors when classifying. This streamlines decision-making, resulting in clearer results. In imbalanced classes, odd k numbers prevent the majority class from dominating the choice, resulting in a more equal assessment of both classes. Odd k values also smooth feature space decision boundaries, making them ideal for noisy data or outlier reduction. 3.5.3 Logistic regression The objective of this algorithm is to determine the probability of the outcome being either 1 or 0. In contrast to linear regression, which is used to predict continuous outcomes, logistic regression is employed to model the chance of an observation being assigned to one of two distinct groups. The sigmoid function is utilized to convert a linear combination of input data into a probability value ranging from 0 to 1. Logistic regression is subject to certain assumptions, such as the requirement of a linear relationship between the input and output variables, as well as the assumption of independent errors. Regularization methods like L1 and L2 can reduce overfitting. 4 Results and discussion Machine learning model performance has been assessed using several factors. (1) A c c u r a c y = ( T P + T N ) ( T P + F P + F N + T N ) Accuracy for Random Forest = 29061 + 29,521 / (29061 + 790 + 628 + 29521) = 0.976 The Accuracy of Random Forest = 97.6% Accuracy for KNN = 28903 + 29573 / (28903 + 948 + 576 + 29573) = 0.974 Accuracy of KNN = 97.4% Accuracy for Logistic Regression = 27292 + 27,414 / (27292 + 2559 + 2735 + 27414) = 0.911 The Accuracy of LR = 91.1% (See Table 5) 5 Conclusion and future scope In this study, we looked at the important problem of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which are a big problem for both people and businesses. We used supervised machine learning to make a System that can tell the difference between normal network traffic and DDoS attacks. We used examples from the CSE-CICIDS2018, CSE-CICIDS2017, and CICDoS datasets and split them into training and testing sets. Three machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression have been used. The dataset was carefully checked for null and missing values. This made sure that the study would be based on good data. Scaling the features with Min-Max normalization was an important part of the cleaning step that brought all the features to the same level. This step is especially important for algorithms like KNN that use distance measures and can be sensitive to how big or small the features are. Additionally, we addressed class imbalance issues to ensure that our model learned effectively from both minority and majority classes, enhancing the model's performance and interpretability. Results demonstrated that Random Forest outperformed other classifiers, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 97.6 %, followed closely by KNN at 97 %, and Logistic Regression at 91.1 %. These results highlight the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in identifying DDoS attacks in network traffic. In future we will improve this model by using large and more real time traffic and also aims to improve the accuracy of this models.

stop words removed. Fig 1 Fig. 2 Note the missing values (including NaNs; highlighted in yellow) and the non-numerical data (highlighted in orange) within this dataset that is uploaded into this Automated Preprocessing Tool. Once uploaded, step 1 shows certain details about the dataset (e.g., the number of rows and columns along with the percentage of missing values). Fig 2 Fig. 3 In step 2, the non-numerical target column (i.e., \u201cCancer\u201d) is changed to 0 s (negatives) and 1 s (positives) through a simple binarization process. In step 3, each of the individual features and their contributions to the missing values are noted. In this case the feature with the most missing values was marked for removal (\u201cbare Nucleoli\u201d column which was contributing 45% of the missing values) to minimize the number of values that we will later impute. In step 4, the \u201cRisk\u201d column which contains text values (Low, intermediate, and high) are converted to the appropriate numerical values in separate columns through the one-hot-encoding process. In step 5, the single dataset uploaded is split into two separate datasets (one for training/initial validation testing and the second one for secondary/generalization testing) to prepare it for the later machine learning model building and testing phases that will follow. Additionally, the missing values are also automatically imputed in this case rather than removed (orange bar) through the embedded multiple-iteration imputation tool. In step 6, multicollinearity is assessed and the following two features with high multicollinearity (\u201csize uniformity\u201d & \u201chigh risk\u201d) are marked for removal in the final datasets created (shown in the summary in step 7).

Fig 5 Table 1 Glossary of terms. Table 1 Term Definition Example from medicine Accuracy A statistical metric used to evaluate the performance of an ML model. It represents the number of correct predictions (true positives and true negative cases) over all predictions (true positives TP, true negatives TN, false positives FP and false negative FN cases).Accuracy = True predictions / All predictions = (TP+TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN)Note: Sometimes the terms \u201cAccuracy\u201d and \u201cPrecision\u201d are confused. Accuracy shows how close a measurement is to the true value while Precision signifies how close measurements of the same item are to each other (see the term \u201cprecision\u201d below for more details). In the following example, this cancer prediction model has resulted in 88 True positive cases and 112 True Negative cases. These are positive cases in real life that the model is predicting correctly as positive and negative.Accuracy = (112 + 88) / (112 + 88 + 8 + 14) = 90% Image, table 1 Activation Functions A mathematical function used in an artificial neural network that defines the output state of a node based on the input(s) In a medical imaging application, a sigmoid activation function could be used to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on its image characteristics Algorithm A method (i.e., set of instructions) that a computer follows to accomplish a task. Some common algorithms in supervised machine learning include Logistic regression, neural networks, K-NN, random forest, support vector machine, and gradient boosting machine. A logistic regression algorithm that has been trained to distinguish sepsis from no sepsis cases. Anomaly Detection AKA outlier detection, is a method that can identify data points that are unusual or unexpected (i.e., deviate significantly from the data majority). May be used to identify outlier vital sign measurements compared to normal reference ranges (e.g., very high heart rates or temp). Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) AI that is on par with humans and capable of general intelligence (i.e., can think like humans). It is mainly in the research realm and considered to be in the \u201cstrong AI\u201d domain (like Artificial Super Intelligence or ASI which theoretically surpasses humans and currently does not exist) Although ChatGPT is technically an Artificial Narrow Intelligence, it is starting to scratch the surface of AGI Artificial Intelligence Paraphrasing Arthur Samuel and others, it is the capability of machines to imitate intelligent human behavior. This umbrella term contains other specific disciplines such as Artificial Narrow Intelligence which includes machine learning (ML) and Artificial General Intelligence ML is an example of Artificial Narrow Intelligence (generally placed in the Weak AI category) while Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a Strong AI category Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) These are collectively considered to be in the \u201cweak AI\u201d domain and include our traditional ML methods along with the more advanced ones such as deep learning. These are designed to perform specific tasks (generally better than humans) and automate many processes. However, they are not capable of general intelligence and can only perform their specific designed task Examples include many of the ML-based models such as Siri, Alexa, Image classification models (that distinguish cancer from non-cancerous tissue) and various tabular data classifier models (e.g., random forest sepsis predictor), etc. Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) A process that can automatically select and optimize the best ML model for a given data with no or little human intervention. MILO Auto-ML is used to automatically find the best performing model for a sepsis study (i.e., best model that can distinguish sepsis from non-septic patients) Batch Size In deep learning, these are the batched number of samples used within the dataset in one iteration of training. This specified hyperparameter allows users to control the number of training examples that are processed at once by the model (notably higher batch sizes will inevitably require more memory usage, therefore the optimal batch size is memory dependent) When using TensorFlow to build a deep learning model to classify normal from abnormal histology images (e.g., colon cancer versus normal colon histology), we can set batch size to 64 which signifies using 64 images at a time to train the model Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) Through this approach we create multiple versions of the same model (each trained on a different subsample of the original dataset) who's averaged predictions yield the model's final prediction. This method is commonly combined with other ensemble ML algorithms (e.g., random forest) to improve their performance. A random forest algorithm that employs bagging is used to find an optimized ML model that distinguishes caved from non-covid cases. Bayes Theorem The formula that describes the relationship between the conditional probabilities of events, and provides a method for calculating the posterior probability of an event given certain evidence The probability (P) of pneumonia (A) given the presence of \u201cfever\u201d (B)P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) Bias-Variance Tradeoff The tradeoff between the error introduced by the bias of a model and the error introduced by the variance in the model's predictions. A model with low bias and high variance may overfit the data and perform poorly on new data, while a model with high bias and low variance may underfit the data and perform poorly. Finding the right balance between these two is critical for optimizing the model's performance. A covid prediction ML model was deployed which showed a great performance on the initial training and validation data, but this ML model performed poorly on the follow up external data. The investigators concluded that this was due to overfitting which explained the model's lack of generalizability. Bit Represents the two possible states (either 0 or 1) of a digital signal In medical digital imaging each pixel may be represented by 8 or more bits (i.e., bytes) Boosting An ML technique that is typically used in some ensemble methods (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machine; GBM) to combine the performance of multiple weak models into a single strong model. A GBM algorithm is used to make a tuberculosis prediction model by combining multiple weak learners (i.e., trees) to create a more accurate ensemble classifier Bootstrapping This is a statistical method that makes estimates of the distribution of a sample statistic by resampling the data with replacement. These samples are drawn with replacement from the original dataset to form a new set of samples (e.g., used to estimate the population's distribution) Bootstrapping was used as part of the bagging method in the random forest model to make a sepsis versus no sepsis ML model Brier Score Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating perfect accuracy and 1 indicating total inaccuracy. It is calculated as the mean square error between predicated probabilities and the actual outcome. The Brier score is evaluated when comparing similar COVID prediction models to find the model with the most reliable probability score (lowest Brier score). ChatGPT This pre-trained language model is a type of AI called \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer\u201d (GPT). GPT models are trained on large text data and capable of generating coherent, contextually appropriate responses to text-based prompts. Specifically, it is a Transformer-based neural network model which uses an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when generating the output. This attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input when generating text, which helps to create more coherent and contextually appropriate output. Almost like a real person. Although this is still technically considered a \u201cnarrow\u201d AI (ANI), it is starting to scratch the surface of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Here's an example of ChatGPT in action: Image, table 1 Classification The process of assigning or categorizing a given set of data into specific categories or classes A classification algorithm was used to identify tumor types based on their characteristics on a medical image Clustering The process of grouping data points into \u201cclusters\u201d based on their shared similarities (i.e., the similarity between the data in a cluster is greater than its similarities to other clusters). This is typically an unsupervised method within machine learning realm k-means method (a popular clustering algorithm) was used in a gene expression study, which identified different subtypes of a disease Convolutional neural network A type of artificial neural network that is particularly effective at analyzing image data In pathology, convolutional neural networks can be used to analyze medical images for tasks such as tumor detection (cancer vs normal), object detection (identifying neutrophils and lymphocytes within the same image) or segmentation. Confidence interval (CI) A range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain level of confidence. In short, A range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a parameter Two acute kidney injury prediction models trained and validated on two different sized datasets showed similar accuracies (e.g., 91%) but different 95% confidence intervals (Model A had a 95% CI of 89%\u221292% while Model B's 95% CI was 82%\u221294%). Hence, the narrower 95% CI (89%\u221292%) is the more reliable model (model A) and most likely included the larger dataset size as well. Confusion matrix A table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model, comparing the model's predictions to the actual targets. These can be binary or multiclass. The simplest confusion matrix is based on a binary classifier and is a 2 \u00d7 2 table (to display the true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative results) while those for multi classification tasks have more elaborate tables to display these results This binary confusion matrix was used to evaluate the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and many other performance measures of this sepsis prediction model (yielding the following results) Image, table 1 Correlation A measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables For example, the hemoglobin and hematocrit values in a dataset may be 98% correlated while hemoglobin and the temperature values in the dataset may be 51% correlated. This displays how hemoglobin and hematocrit are closer related than hemoglobin and temperature are (at least within this hypothetical dataset) Cropping The process of removing unwanted parts of an image or data set to focus on a specific region of interest In medical imaging, cropping can be used to remove non-essential parts of an image, such as the background, to improve the accuracy of image analysis Cross Validation (CV) A method that uses different data subsets to evaluate the performance of the ML model (this can help minimize overfitted models) The classic example is k-fold cv in which the data is divided into k subsets (e.g., 5) which means that there will be 5 variations of the training and testing data as the data is split into these groups (hence, in this case tested on 5 different test subsets). Decision tree These ML algorithms use a tree-like model to make predictions based on the characteristics of the data and can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Simple decision trees are not commonly employed for our ML studies. However, the ensemble tree methods (e.g., random forest and Gradient boosting machine) are found to be very capable in providing high performing ML models (e.g., sepsis versus no sepsis prediction) Dependent variable These are also referred to as the \u201ctarget\u201d (sometimes also called outcomes column). In a supervised method (Y = f(X) + e), these represent the Y in which the features (independent variables X) are mapped to them through a function f. In summary, this is the variable that is predicted by a machine learning model based on the input data. A simple binary dependent variable (i.e., target) could be the presence or absence of cancer. For example, the ML model ultimately will be able to make a distinction between cancer cases and non-cancer cases based on histologic features that are present within the images. Ensemble method A machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to produce a more accurate or stable prediction Random forest and Gradient boosting machine are some classic ensemble tree methods capable in providing high performing ML models (e.g., sepsis versus no sepsis prediction) Epoch This refers to a single pass through the entire training data. In other words, a single iteration in a machine learning model's training process, during which the model is presented with all the training data. This is typically one of several hyperparameters that can be set within a neural network model. It is important to understand the relationship between epoch, batch size and iteration parameters in a ML model training process. Number of iterations = (total number of epochs * (total number of examples / batch size))For example, if we had 4000 samples in our training step, then these 4000 samples can be divided into batches of 500, which means that 1 epoch will take 8 iterations to complete F1 In classification models, the F1 score represents the harmonic mean of precision (i.e., positive predictive value) and recall (i.e., sensitivity) of the model and defined as:F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) In real-world breast cancer diagnosis scenario, a balance between precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity) of the ML model need to be achieved. These two measures typically move in opposite directions (i.e., when sensitivity goes up precision usually goes down and vice versa). This allows us to find the balance between our false positive and false negative cases since false negatives can sometimes severely impact patient's life (e.g., in a cancer prediction ML model), while a false positive can lead to unnecessary tests and/or treatments. False Negative In a classification model, these represent the positive cases in real life that the model incorrectly predicts as negative In the following example, this cancer prediction model has resulted in 8 false negative cases. These are positive cases in real life that the model is predicting incorrectly as negative cases. Image, table 1 False Positive In a classification model, these represent the negative cases in real life that the model incorrectly predicts as positive. False positive rate (FPR) and specificity are inversely proportional. Hence, in an ROC curve, the X axis of the curve represents the FPR as 1-specificity. (See ROC for more details) In the following example, this cancer prediction model has resulted in 14 false positive cases. These are negative cases in real life that the model is predicting incorrectly as positive cases. Image, table 1 Features These are also referred to as the \u201cindependent variables\u201d (sometimes also called predictors or attributes). In a supervised method (Y = f(X) + e), these represent the X in the formula above that map to the target Y through a function f. For example, in our ML model, the following \u201cfeatures\u201d (heart rate, temperature, hemoglobin and ECG findings) are mapped to the heart disease presence or absence target column. Therefore, values for the above features from future patients can be inserted into the ML model to tell us if they are positive or negative for heart disease. GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) A type of machine learning algorithm that involves two competing neural networks (hence the term \u201cAdversarial\u201d), known as the generator and the discriminator. The generator attempts to produce data that is like a training dataset, while the discriminator tries to distinguish real data from the generated data. A GAN could be used in medical imaging to generate synthetic CT scans or MRI images that can be used for training other machine learning algorithms. It can also be used to build synthetic tabular/numerical data to create synthetic heart disease data from the real data counterpart Generalizability The ability of a machine learning model to make accurate predictions not only on its initial training/validation test but also on new, unseen data (secondary or tertiary datasets). Our prostate cancer model was generalizable since it had very similar performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1, etc.) on both the initial validation test and the follow up secondary and tertiary test sets.In contrast, our colon cancer model was shown to be overfitted, which meant that it performed well on the initial validation test but poorly on the follow up secondary and tertiary test sets (i.e., not generalizable). Gradient Descent This is an optimization method used to minimize a function (typically the cost function of a machine learning model). It is an iterative process that starts with an initial guess for the parameters of the model and updates the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function with respect to the parameters, until it reaches a local or global minimum. Gradient Descent is often used in deep learning such as in building an ML model that can differentiate prostate cancer cases from their non-cancerous counterparts.It's also worth mentioning that deep learning models have multiple hyperparameters, and the optimization can be computationally expensive, which is why variations of the gradient descent approach may be employed (e.g., Adam) to optimize these. Hyperparameters These model parameters are set before training a machine learning model, as opposed to parameters that are learned during training. They help control the learning process and the capacity of the model to learn. \u201cHyper\" in hyperparameter refers to the fact that they are \"higher-level\" (not learned from the data during training) as opposed to the regular parameters of the model which are learned from the data during training. The following are some common examples of hyperparameters in various ML algorithms:-Number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer in a neural network-Number of trees and the maximum depth of each tree in a random forest-Regularization strength: The degree to which the model is regularized to prevent overfitting.-Number of neighbors measured in K-NN Imputation The process of replacing missing values in a dataset with some value based on inference Examples include:Mean imputation: replace the missing values with the mean of the valuesRegression imputation: uses a predictive model, such as linear regression, to predict the missing values based on the observed values of other variablesMultiple Imputation, etc. Independent variable These are also referred to as the \u201cfeatures\u201d (sometimes also called predictors or attributes). In a supervised method (Y = f(X) + e), these represent the X in the formula above that map to the target Y through a function f. For example, in our ML model, the following \u201cindependent variables/features\u201d (heart rate, temperature, hemoglobin and ECG findings) are mapped to the heart disease presence or absence target column. Therefore, values for the above features from future patients can be inserted into the ML model to tell us if they are positive or negative for heart disease. Irreducible error In a supervised method (Y = f(X) + e), X represents the features that are mapped to the target Y through a function f. \u201ce\u201d represents the Irreducible error.This is the error that cannot be reduced or eliminated by any machine learning algorithm, due to the inherent noise or variability in the data In medicine, irreducible error could arise from factors such as measurement error or inter-observer variability Iterations Number of times a machine learning algorithm is applied to the data during training. During each iteration, the model processes a batch of training examples, which are a subset of the entire training datasetNumber of iterations = (total number of epochs * (total number of examples / batch size)) For example, if the training dataset contains 1000 examples, and the batch size is set to 100, then each iteration would process 100 examples, and the training process would require 10 iterations to process the entire training dataset. k-fold A method of cross-validation in which the data is divided into k equal-sized subsets, and the algorithm is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the test set For example, a k-fold of 10 means that an 80%\u221220% train-test split data will have 10 versions of this train and test sets (i.e., different 20% test sets that will better represent the model's true performance on the entire data evaluated). This helps minimize overfitting (especially true on big data studies). K-Means A type of clustering algorithm (unsupervised ML approach) that groups data points into k clusters based on their similarities In medicine, K-Means can be used to identify subgroups of patients with similar symptoms or treatment responses K-NN A type of non-parametric machine learning algorithm (for data classification and regression tasks) that uses the k number of training examples that are closest to a new input, and then uses the most common class among these k nearest neighbors as the prediction for the new input K-NN model was used to build an acute kidney injury prediction model within the burn's population. Kernel Function a function used to transform the data into a higher dimensional space to become easier to separate and to find a decision boundary A kernel function is commonly used in support vector machine (SVM) and typical kernels include linear, RBF, sigmoid, and polynomial Keyword Extraction A natural language processing (NLP) technique for identifying the most important words or phrases in a document Using keyword extraction to identify the most important symptoms in a patient's medical records. Leave-one-out A method of cross-validation where a model is trained on all but one data point and then tested on the single left out point Using leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model for predicting heart disease Lemmatization The process of reducing a word to its base form. Lemmatizing patient notes to reduce each word to its base form (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"run\") for easier analysis. Machine learning A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms on data to enable them to make predictions or take actions without being explicitly programmed. Using a random forest machine learning model to predict which patients are at risk for developing heart disease MLP Multi-Layer Perceptron. The unit of an artificial neural network is the perceptron which represent the single artificial neuron. MLP is comprised of multiple layers of fully interconnected perceptrons (with typically non-linear activation function) which also utilize the concept of backpropagation, collectively distinguishing them from a simple linear perceptron. The MLP also includes 3 layers: Input, hidden and output layers. An MLP was used in a clinical medicine study to build a model that predicts the presence or absence of early sepsis in a burn's population. Model Refers to the result product created by an ML algorithm from its fed training data. This model maintains the mathematical relationships of the training data and can now make predictions on future unforeseen data A sepsis model was generated that was able to predict the presence or absence of early sepsis in a burn's population with a high degree of accuracy and precision Multicollinearity A phenomenon in which multiple features (i.e., Independent /predictor variables) in a supervised model are highly correlated to each other, which can affect the model's accuracy and interpretability by overemphasizing certain features that represent the same or nearly the same thing The model included two very closely related features (i.e., hemoglobin and hematocrit) with very high correlation (99%). Given that the model only had 3 feature inputs (hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood pressure) for predicting heart disease, the extra emphasis on the two highly correlated variables (hemoglobin and hematocrit) may dilute the true contribution of the blood pressure variable and ultimately deteriorate the model's final performance Multi-Layer Perceptron See MLP See MLP Na\u00efve Bayes A machine learning classifier algorithm that makes predictions based on simple na\u00efve assumption that the features are independent of each other (which is not likely the case in many studies). A Na\u00efve Bayes classifier may sometimes yield good results (depending on what data is involved). Additionally, it is important to note that as opposed to many of the other supervised algorithms (random forest, neural network, logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.) which have hyperparameters to tune, the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms are devoid of hyperparameters which further highlights their true simplistic approach Natural Language Processing (NLP) A subfield of artificial intelligence that involves using algorithms and other computational techniques to process and analyze natural language data, such as text and speech. ChatGPT is a very powerful NLP-based chat platform that is scratching the surface of Artificial General Intelligence. Other NLP-based platforms include Siri, Alexa, etc. Negative Predictive Value (NPV) In essence describes the likelihood of no disease given a negative test. NPV along with PPV, F1 and Accuracy are prevalence-dependent statistical metricsNPV = (True negatives) / (True negatives + False negatives) A negative D-dimer test was found to have a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 8.8% and NPV of 100% for exclusion of pulmonary embolism in the proper setting. Hence, a negative result in such settings in essence rules out the disease. Neural Network Collectively these machine learning algorithms attempt to simulate the structure and function of the human brain. They are typically comprised of various artificial neuronal layers which include an input layer, intervening hidden layer(s), and output layer(s) A convolutional neural network trained on colon cancer and normal colon cases is now able to identify new colon cancer cases (based on histological image features) Normalization A type of scaling used in ML. The typical normalization scaling approach (e.g. Min-Max Scaler) changes the range of values of the variable which may or may not change the shape of the distribution of the variable through (x \u2013 min) / (max \u2013 min) approach (e.g., changing the minimum value of the variable to 0 and its maximum to 1). In medical research, normalization might be used to scale the units of measurements for different predictor/feature variables (that may have different scales) and scale them all to values between 0 and 1.e.g., some features may have values in the 100 s and some with values below 10, such as blood pressure values and creatinine values, respectively) Object Detection A type of computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing specific objects in images or videos. In laboratory medicine, object detection could be used to automatically identify and locate different white blood cells in medical images, such as in a peripheral blood smear. These objects are many times seen as boxed entities within the single image. Optimizers An ML method that is used to adjust the parameters of a model to minimize a loss function. In essence it is used to improve its performance. Examples of optimizers in ML include but are not limited to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam Overfitting A phenomenon in which a machine learning model performs well on the training data but poorly on new or unseen data. This can occur when the model is too complex or when it has been trained on a limited dataset. Note: overfitting typically means not generalizable An example is a model that performed well on the initial validation test (e.g., 97% accuracy and F1 of 91) while doing poorly on the follow-up secondary and tertiary generalization test sets (e.g., 80% accuracy and F1 of 73). Parametric algorithm An algorithm that makes assumptions about the underlying data distribution to make predictions or classify items. Parametric algorithms are often faster and more interpretable than non-parametric algorithms, but they may be less accurate if the data does not conform to the assumptions. In medical diagnosis, a parametric algorithm (e.g., logistic regression) might be used to predict a patient's likelihood of developing a certain condition based on their age and other variables, if the data follows a normal distribution. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique (an unsupervised learning method) that is used to transform and/or reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the original information as possible In an imaging study, PCA could be used to reduce the number of pixels in a large medical image, making it easier to process and analyze Pixel This is short for \u201cPicture Element\u201d and is the smallest unit of a digital image that can be independently assigned a color or intensity value. In other words, it is the smallest unit of information that can be displayed on a screen In digital pathology space, the histologic image of a tissue sample taken from a patient with cancer could show individual cancer cells that are represented by pixels that are a different color or intensity than the surrounding healthy cells Pooling Layer In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a pooling layer is a type of hidden layer that is used to down-sample the spatial dimensions of the input data, reducing the number of parameters and improving the network's computational efficiency while preserving important information For example, in VGG (a deep convolutional neural network), the pooling layers are used after every two or three convolutional layers to reduce the size of the feature maps and the number of parameters in the model Positive Predictive Value (PPV) This is also known as precision. In medicine, this can be seen as basically the likelihood of disease given a positive test. PPV along with NPV, F1 and Accuracy are classic prevalence-dependent statistical metrics.PPV = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives) For example, let's say we have a trained cancer prediction model that is now tested on another dataset of 500 images (mix of positive and negative cases). Out of those 500 images, the model predicted 150 images as positive for cancer. From those, 120 images were shown to be truly positive (cancer was present) and 30 images were false positives (no cancer was present). Therefore, the PPV of this algorithm is 120 / (120 + 30) = 120/150 = 0.8 or 80% Precision Another name for Positive Predictive Value (PPV) See Positive Predictive Value (PPV) above R 2 In the context of regression analysis, the R2 metric is a measure of the goodness of fit for a linear regression model, indicating how well the model fits the data. An R2 value of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while an R2 value of 0 indicates no relationship between the predictor and response variables. For example, the R2 can be calculated within a regression model to see how much of the weight variation is explained by height. This was shown to be 0.8 which shows that these two variables (height and weight) are relatively highly correlated in this example. Random Forest An ensemble tree-based machine learning algorithm that combines the predictions of multiple randomly generated decision trees, which can potentially improve the model's accuracy and reduce overfitting. A random forest model was found to be one of the best models for predicting early sepsis in our burn's population. Regression In the context of statistics, regression is a type of analysis that is used to model the relationship between one or more predictor variables and a response variable. However, in machine learning this refers to a model that is used to predict a continuous numerical outcome/target (rather than discrete classes). The classic regression model example that peoples use is prediction of a home price based on the house's zip code, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and square footage. In lab medicine, this same concept can be used to build a random forest regression model that can predict the cost of a laboratory test (given certain other variables). Regularization A technique used in machine learning to minimize overfitting. Ultimately, this can be thought of to address the bias-variance tradeoff issue by adding a penalty to the loss function of a model to reduce its variance at a sacrifice of a small amount of bias. For example, this is accomplished by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function which ultimately leads to a more generalizable model (less likely to overfit). Common examples of this includes LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net. 1 ROC/AUC A ROC curve is plotted by assigning the model's various sensitivities and 1 minus specificities (i.e., False Positive Rates) at different thresholds (i.e., cut-off values). After which the area under this ROC curve (ROC-AUC) is calculated and used as a metric to evaluate the classification model's global performance potential (reflecting on how the overall model can separate the output classes). Two delayed graft function ML models were compared based on their ROC-AUC and one was shown to be 0.56 while the other showed an ROC-AUC of 0.72. The 0.56 is close to predicting by random chance (i.e., 0.5) so the 0.72 model is found to be a better performing model in this case. Note: the closer the ROC-AUC to 1, the better. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) A metric that measures the average difference between the predicted values and the true values in a dataset when using a regression model. The lower the RMSE value, the better (which signifies a better fit) In a regression model that predicts the systolic blood pressure of a patient, the root mean square error could be used to measure the model's performance. Note: they are generally not used for comparison of models with different targets (in those cases R2 comparison is generally preferred) Sample A representative portion of a population, selected for analysis to draw conclusions about the population as a whole A sample population of all septic patients were taken to be used for building a sepsis prediction ML model. Scaling See the terms Normalization and Standardization for more details e.g., Normalization and Standardization Secondary/Tertiary Test Sets In machine learning, a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of a trained model. The secondary or tertiary testing sets (i.e., generalization test set) are separate from the initial training/validation test set. These are used to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data. Sample of blood from a cohort of patients was used to build an ML model whose subset of initial validation test was shown to identify positive cases. This ML model was then subjected to additional tests (secondary and tertiary tests) from other sample populations of patients. Sensitivity The ability of a test to accurately identify individuals who have a specific condition or disease. In other words, \u201clikelihood of positive test given disease\u201d. This is also known as positive recall or True Positive Rate (TPR) in the ML world.Sensitivity = = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negative) In the following example, this cancer prediction model has resulted in 88 True positive cases. These are positive cases in real life that the model is predicting correctly as positive.Sensitivity = 88 / (88 + 8) = 92% Image, table 1 Sentiment Analysis A natural language processing (NLP) approach that helps identify and extract subjective information from text, such as the emotional state or the overall attitude towards a topic. This could be an expression, that is, the opinions, appraisals, emotions, or attitudes towards something. A sentiment analysis approach was used to acquire patient feedbacks on a new drug which is helping us determine the overall patient satisfaction with this drug and to also identify potential side effects Specificity The ability of a test to accurately identify individuals who do not have a specific condition or disease. In other words, \u201clikelihood of negative test given no disease\u201d. This is also sometimes known as True Negative Rate (TPR) in the ML world.Specificity = (True negatives) / (True negatives + False positives) In the following example, this cancer prediction model has resulted in 112 True negative cases. These are negative cases in real life that the model is predicting correctly as negative.Specificity = 112 / (112 + 14) = 89% Image, table 1 Standardization A scaling preprocessing approach. Standard Scaler is a commonly used standardization approach that transforms the variables through the (x \u2013 mean) / standard deviation approach yielding a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 without distorting differences in their ranges In medical research, standardization might be used to scale the units of measurements for different predictor/feature variables (that may have different scales) and scale them all to a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1e.g., some features may have values in the 100 s and some features have values below 10, such as blood pressure values and creatinine values, respectively). These values are all scaled into a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1 before feeding them into machine learning Stemming A preprocessing natural language processing (NLP) technique for text data that removes common prefixes and suffixes from words (reducing words to their base form; \u201cstem\u201d). An example in the pathology world would be reducing words such as \"cancer,\" \"cancerous,\" \"carcinoma\" to \"cancer\" as the root word Stop Words Common, uninformative words that may be excluded from natural language processing (NLP) tasks to improve the efficiency and the accuracy of the end model. Words such as \"a,\" \"an,\" \"the,\" \"in,\" \"on,\" are of little value (do not contribute significant meaning or context to the text) and often removed in the preprocessing step. In a pathology search tool, removing words such as \"study\", \"research\", or \"report,\" may not carry much meaning in terms of the specific case for a pathology report (e.g., looking for \u201csarcoma cases\u201d) Supervised Learning Supervised learning as the name implies uses data that makes use of \u201clabeled\u201d targets (human designated). Examples include Classification and Regression ML Tasks Support-Vector Machine (SVM) By defining an optimized hyperplane this supervised approach enables us to ultimately differentiate the classes of interest (i.e., a classification task) by optimizing the margin that separates these classes. An SVM model using an RBF kernel was found to be one of our best performing sepsis prediction models. Synthetic Data New data that is generated by a machine, rather than being collected from the real world. The machine first learns the collective mathematical relationships of the real data which is then used as a function (i.e., model) to create new data that maintains the real data's collective characteristics. Synthetic data can be used to supplement or replace real-world data in certain machine learning tasks. The use of such validated data may be very useful for drastically expediting pilot studies and can revolutionize our current approach in certain research domains (since such data can be more readily accessible to all, considering its nature of not representing any individual patient info) Target In ML studies, this refers to the dependent variable (AKA \u201coutcome\u201d measure) within a supervised model In a dataset that is building an ML model to predict \u201csepsis\u201d based on patient's hemoglobin, temp and blood pressure, the \u201csepsis\u201d variable (i.e., positive, or negative cases) is the Target variable Tensor A mathematical object that represents a multidimensional array of numbers. Tensors are often used in neural network ML algorithms to represent high-dimensional complex data such as images or texts (e.g., through word embedding) In pathology whole slide imaging studies, tensors can be used to represent the histopathology images (represented as multi-dimensional arrays, with the dimensions representing the height, width, depth, and other characteristics of the image) Testing Set See the term \u201cSecondary/Tertiary Test Sets\u201d above See the term \u201cSecondary/Tertiary Test Sets\u201d above Threshold This is the value (e.g., probability) that is used by the ML model to make predictions. For example, in most binary classifiers, the model outputs a probability for each class as being called positive (1) or negative (0). By default, most ML model probability thresholds are set to 0.5 which means that if the probability of a class is found to be >0.5, that input is then classified as the positive (i.e., 1) class while those below that threshold will be categorized as negative (i.e., 0) classes. Investigators who initially had created a hypothetical Ebola prediction model (0.5 threshold) found it to be 98% sensitive and 94% specific. Since they did not want the model to miss any real positive cases, the new goal was to improve its sensitivity to 100%. To do this, they adjusted the model's threshold from 0.5 to 0.4 which made the model 100% sensitive (decreased the false negative cases) and 93% specific. Tokenization This is a routine preprocessing task that is applied to NLP tasks to breaks down the input texts into individual words or symbols. Tokenization can also be applied to images. In a pathology search tool, tokenization could be used to extract specific information from the pathology reports (e.g., diagnostic codes, or descriptions of specific histologic findings).The term tokenization can also refer to replacing patient's sensitive data with unique identifiers (goal being to retain the essential information while protecting patient privacy) For example, a pathologist is using a search tool that incorporates NLP. Their goal is to search for all cases of \"basal cell carcinoma\" within their hospital system. The tool would then tokenize the keywords above which will then enable it to search through the database for any images or reports that contain those specific words Training set A subset of the data used to train a machine learning model. See \u201cTrain-Test Split\u201d for more details In colon cancer image study, 500 images of colon cancer and 500 cases of normal colon were used in an 80\u201320 train-test approach (i.e., 80% used for training and 20% used for initial validation test) to train a deep neural network that will create the model that is able to distinguish these two classes (cancer and normal). Train-Test Split Supervised ML studies follow the process of train-test split which means that a subset of the data is used to train the model and then the remaining is used to do the initial validation testing on the model For example, the 80\u201320 split, in which 80% of the Cancer images and normal tissue images are used to train the model and the left over 20% is used to do the initial validation test to assess the model's performance Transfer Learning An ML method (commonly used in many deep learning image studies) in which a pretrained ML model (trained and optimized on one task) is used as the starting point to retrain it for a different task The ResNet-50 neural network model (which was trained on the ImageNet data to distinguish various images of animals, vehicles, buildings, etc.) is now retrained through transfer learning from histological images of colon cancer and normal colon cases to make a new colon cancer predictor ML model Unsupervised learning Machine learning algorithms/methods which are used to identify patterns on \u201cUnlabeled\u201d data output variables (i.e., no human input) Using the k-means clustering method the computer can identify different subtypes (i.e., clusters) of a particular disease Validation test This refers to the initial testing of a trained ML model to determine how well the model initially performs on unseen dataSee \u201cTrain-Test Split\u201d for more details For example, the 80\u201320 split, in which 80% of the Cancer images and normal tissue images are used to train the model and the left over 20% is used to do the initial validation test to assess the model's performance.Note: especially for small to intermediate sized data the initial validation test set is not generally enough and additional test sets (e.g., secondary & tertiary test sets) are required to truly assess the model's generalizability. Variance In statistics, this refers to a measure of spread of a data's distribution by quantifying how much the individual values in a dataset deviate or vary from the mean or average valueIn ML terminologies, this refers to the degree to which the model's predictions vary based on changes in the input data or the model's parameters and it is associated with model complexity as the model is trained (i.e., increased training typically leads to a more complex model which translates to increased variance).See Bias-Variance Tradeoff for more details A cancer prediction ML model was found to be not generalizable (i.e., overfitted) which is likely due to overtraining of the model and becoming markedly complex (i.e., increased variance led to the overfitting in this case).See Bias-Variance Tradeoff for more details Table 2 Common preprocessing tasks for tabular/numerical datasets. Table 2 Type of problem Solution / Potential preprocessing tasks to address this Special points Missing values Remove the missing values 20 Generally preferred if the data size is not drastically compromised (when data is removed). If the data size is compromised, may consider other approaches such as imputation Missing values Impute the missing values (assign a value by inference) 21 Typically, should not be done on secondary / generalization dataset since it may skew or exaggerate the performance of the ML model Different variables having different ranges of their numerical data Standardization scaling through Standard Scaler approach or Normalization scaling through the Min-Max Scaler approach for the data values There is difference between Standardization and Normalization. Standardization scaling (e.g. Standard Scaler) transforms the variables through the (x \u2013 mean) / standard deviation approach yielding a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 without distorting differences in their ranges. In contrast, the typical normalization scaling approach (e.g. Min-Max Scaler) changes the range of values of the variable which may or may not change the shape of the distribution of the variable through (x \u2013 min) / (max \u2013 min) approach (e.g., changing the minimum value of the variable to 0 and its maximum to 1). Text that needs to convert to a numerical value Binarization This is a great option for binary target columns (e.g., Cancer vs No Cancer) or certain binary feature columns (Shortness of Breath being present or absent, etc.).For example, a single column of Cancer cases which contains \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cNegative\u201d cases can be converted to a binary column of 0 s (Negatives) and 1 s (Positives), as such: Image, table 1 Text that needs to convert to a numerical value Encoding This could sometimes become problematic since the true representation of each value may not be presented in the most accurate way (especially since some of these may be seen as having higher significance in their measured values for the algorithms that could ultimately deteriorate the final ML model).For example, a single column of Colors which contains \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cbrown\u201d values is converted to 3 separate numerical values of 1, 2 and 3 (ultimately incorrectly signifying that encoded values listed below for brown (3) is 3 times as significant as blue (1), etc., for certain algorithms (e.g., k-NN). Image, table 1 Text that needs to convert to a numerical value One-Hot Encoding: Creates a new binary column for each unique category in the data 22 One-Hot encoding can address the simple encoding issue (shown above) by separating the individual characteristics within the column into their own unique binary individual columns.For example, a single column of Colors which contains \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cbrown\u201d values is converted to 3 separate binary columns titled \u201cColors_blue\u201d, \u201cColors_green\u201d, and \u201cColors_brown\u201d as such: This now maintains the true intrinsic values of the assigned colors which ultimately translates to a higher likelihood of better representation of these values within the ML model. This approach is not without its own issues as it can add many additional (sometimes unnecessary) columns to the dataset and become computationally very demanding. Image, table 1 Multicollinearity Multicollinearity assessment tool Multicollinearity in short, refers to redundant independent variables /features within a dataset. 19 High correlations between certain features may also sometimes deteriorate an ML model's performance as certain feature's contributions may overpower others (especially when the number of features/independent variables are low). For example, in a hypothetical kidney disease dataset the following 3 features (Hemoglobin, Hematocrit and creatinine) are present and hemoglobin and hematocrit (not surprisingly) show a 99% correlation. If both Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are kept in the final model, their summative feature contribution to the target (i.e., kidney disease) may dilute the true contribution of creatinine to the target. By removing either the Hemoglobin or Hematocrit value from the final dataset, the multicollinearity issue noticed here will be addressed and the final model may potentially become more predictive. Features that are not contributing much to the overall data (i.e., noise) Feature selection tools By employing certain feature assessment tools (e.g., ANOVA F-value-based Select Percentile or the Random Forest Feature Importance's feature selection processes), we can identify which set of features are most contributing to a given target which will help to potentially minimize the noise (the unnecessary features) in the dataset.

Yet, most pathologists and laboratory professionals remain unfamiliar with such tools and are unprepared for their inevitable integration. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present an overview of key elements within this emerging data science discipline. First, we will cover general, well-established concepts within ML, such as data type concepts, data preprocessing methods, and ML study design. We will describe common supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and their associated common machine learning terms (provided within a comprehensive glossary of terms that are discussed within this review). Overall, this review will offer a broad overview of the key concepts and algorithms in machine learning, with a focus on pathology and laboratory medicine. The objective is to provide an updated useful reference for those new to this field or those who require a refresher. Keywords Artificial intelligence Machine learning Pathology Laboratory medicine Supervised Learning Predictive modeling Introduction The practice of medicine generates large volumes of complex data requiring the need for advanced analytical tools. More and more, these tools are becoming centered about machine learning. Machine learning is within the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) and incorporates numerous key elements from both statistics and computer science disciplines. The goal within most machine learning tasks is to find patterns within the data that can then generate models capable of making predictions on new unforeseen data. Pathology and laboratory medicine play central roles in many medical decisions whose complex and ever-growing data are increasingly in need of machine learning integration. Additionally, the role of the pathologists and laboratory professionals as gatekeepers of such data further supports the need for them to become increasingly familiar with the capabilities and known limitations within this space. As professionals who are well versed in best practices of test development, it is logical for us to also help guide the development of ML tools since they share many similarities with laboratory-developed tests (LDTs). Even though there are key similarities between LDTs and ML testing platforms, there are also unique differences within each that further add to the challenges that we face as we deploy such tools. One major difference revolves around the changing data that is inevitable within the ML studies with time (especially for the tabular data tasks). In essence, this is referring to the concept of data drift which is definitional for most tabular data ML studies but not a major point of discussion for most LDTs. Regardless of the differences and challenges, the need for standardization of key aspects of these advanced analytics platforms (i.e., study design and machine learning operations) should remain a high priority that will not only ensure their reproducibility but also highlight their true value within the medical arena. The absence of such integral processes and standards can potentially compromise our patient care efforts as we embrace these tools in our settings. Additionally, by carefully monitoring the ML models after deployment, these measures will ultimately ensure the quality of the data and the model's predictive outcomes. A general understanding of these essential domains is critical for their integration and best use. Therefore, bridging the knowledge gap in this space for all involved will not only be instrumental for their enhanced success rates but more importantly will serve as a critical step for continuously improving the quality of these studies and their associated implemented ML models. To that end, the main purpose of this article is to build on the foundation of prior excellent AI/ML review articles and to provide the readers with updated information on specific aspects of the machine learning arena. Specifically, the article will focus on data types, data pre-processing tasks, and how each of these feeds into the various machine learning algorithms employed along with their common ML-associated terminologies (provided within a relatively comprehensive glossary of terms; Table 1 ). Data types Everything in machine learning starts with the data and the various data types drive the respective machine-learning approaches that are employed within this process. The main four data types involved include image, text, audio, and tabular/numerical data. 1a. Image data: This data type consists of visual information, which is typically organized as arrays of pixel values. An example of this in pathology could be microscopic images (from a whole slide image: WSI) from various tissue samples (e.g., colon cancer versus normal colon). These could then be used to train certain ML models that can ultimately help differentiate various images (e.g., to distinguish cancer versus normal tissue). For these to become ingestible within machine learning libraries, the image data will typically need to be organized into multidimensional arrays or tensors, each consisting of various image characteristics (e.g., height and width of the image, along with a variety of other intrinsic features within the image). There could also be metadata attached to these files which could represent a variety of other associated specific image features (e.g., video frame number, specific location data, etc.). 1b. Text data: These consists of individual words or sentences that can be employed within the various natural language processing (NLP) platforms. NLP ultimately enables computers to read, understand, and generate human language. After the tragedies of World War II, globalization became a priority, and NLP was born in the hopes of automating translation from one spoken language to another 2 . Like any other non-numerical data type, text data will also need to be transformed into a numerical representation for them to become machine compatible. Examples within diagnostic surgical pathology could include NLP integration for transcription or search tasks. With studies dating back to the 1950s and 60s, NLP has always contained its own set of unique challenges 3 . Classic challenges within NLP include the need for addressing ambiguities (such as homophones), syntax and semantics (i.e., context) issues, dealing with anaphora, and pragmatics awareness to list a few. Homophones, for instance, are difficult for machines to understand, especially if we consider each word without context 4 . If I am looking at a sentence that contains the word \u201cbark\u201d without any knowledge of the discussion that is happening around the said word, I wouldn't know if we were talking about dogs or trees, or misspellings of 18th century sailing vessels 5 . Another important challenge in NLP is understanding context 6 . Whether we realize it or not, our minds have developed a deep knowledge of how we use language in numerous scenarios and how these culminate across different spoken languages 7 . Machines do not have this advantage, so they have to take into account corpora 8 . These refer to a large collection of text data that can be used to train and evaluate the NLP algorithms which will be discussed in more detail in the pre-processing section. Many complex subtleties in language are hard to translate into code, which makes context crucial and further complicates the use of NLP models. However, newer NLP-based platforms and approaches (such as OpenAI's ChatGPT) are starting to address many of these key issues and scratching the surface of Artificial General Intelligence (see Table 1 for more details). 1c. Audio data: This form of data is comprised of sound waves. The classic example in medicine involves heart sounds, which the ML model can be trained on to discover certain underlying medical conditions. This type of data is not routinely used within pathology and laboratory medicine since most information within our field involves image, text, and tabular data formats. 1d. Tabular/Numerical data: Numerical data consist of measurements and counts for various clinical, laboratory, or historical values and are the most abundant data present within the healthcare space. The correct representation of numerical data will ensure that the findings are systematic and reproducible. These are typically categorized as qualitative or categorical (i.e., nominal, and ordinal data types) versus quantitative values (interval or ratio data types). Qualitative data (categorical data) answers the questions revolving around \u201cWhat/Which category?\u201d (e.g., abnormality levels of a test result: normal versus high versus low and cancer versus normal tissue, to name a few). As noted, these can also be further grouped into nominal and ordinal data types 9 , 10 . Nominal data does not follow any order between the categories (e.g., eye color category of brown, blue, or green) while ordinal data can be ranked or ordered (e.g., high-grade, intermediate-grade, and low-grade tumors). Within these categorical/qualitative data types, if the number of options is confined to just two values (e.g., cancer versus normal), then these are better known as binary categories. In contrast to qualitative data, quantitative data answers the question \u201cHow much/many?\u201d (e.g., number of pregnancies, patient hemoglobin values, BMI, etc.). These can be further classified into either discrete classes or continuous numerical data or as interval data (no zero point present as in BMI) versus ratio (has a true zero point as in the number of pregnancies) data types 9 , 10 . In summary, continuous data represents any value within a certain range and can include decimals (e.g. body temp 98.1F) as opposed to discrete data that can only take on a limited set of values (e.g. the number of medications a patient is taking is 3) 11 . Many of these data subtypes are more commonly seen within laboratory medicine and clinical disciplines rather than surgical pathology since these values from a patient's electronic medical record (EMR) are typically extracted in tabular formats. Regardless of which data is present, many tabular data files contain a combination of the aforementioned data subtypes which are used to train their respective machine learning algorithms for various tasks (e.g., prediction of cancer or sepsis) 12 . These values are typically presented within organized rows and columns within the given table. The values within each row generally represent an individual (i.e., patient instance) and each column represents the various variables (i.e., features/independent variables or target/dependent variable) for a given patient. The features (independent variables) within the tabular dataset are ultimately mapped (through some function) to the target of interest (dependent variables/target or outcome) to acquire the ML model that can be used for making future predictions on unforeseen new data. For a supervised ML model these can also be represented as follows: Y = f (X) + e where Y represents the target of interest, X represents the features, f represents the function (the acquired mathematical relationship between the X and Y) and e representing the irreducible error since no ML model is ever perfect. However, before proceeding to the machine learning algorithms and training steps to map the features to the target, the data of interest will likely require various cleaning and standardization tasks which are collectively known as data pre-processing. Data preprocessing Data pre-processing is a crucial step in the machine learning life cycle. One of the great challenges within the field of healthcare is access to a clean and complete dataset. The quality of the data is extremely important as this can influence the ability of the model to learn and ultimately become generalizable. The type of preprocessing is also dependent on the data type and their respective employed ML algorithm. Common pre-processing tasks within image classification may include image resizing, cropping, normalization, image augmentation (e.g., image rotation, etc.), noise reduction (e.g., blur), and color space conversions while those for text data NLP classification tasks may need tokenization, lowercasing, stop words removal, lemmatization, stemming, and encoding (i.e., converting to numbers through one-hot encoding or word embeddings). On other hand, the common pre-processing tasks in tabular data include tasks that may concentrate on minimizing noise within the data by finding the optimized number of features (i.e., by employing certain feature selectors or feature transformation tools), finding ways to best deal with missing values (i.e., removal versus imputation) and outlier data, along with important scaling tasks (e.g., normalizing the data values through a scaling transformation). Below we will dive deeper into some of these preprocessing approaches (see Table 2 ). 2a. Image Data Preprocessing: Image preprocessing techniques such as resizing and cropping play a crucial role in the development of an optimized machine learning model. Resizing images to a uniform dimension ensures that the neural network receives consistent inputs. Cropping, on the other hand, allows for a more focused analysis, zeroing in on a specific region of interest within an image. These techniques can help to reduce noise and irrelevant information in the data, therefore improving the accuracy of the model. Additionally, other data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, and normalizing can also be applied to increase the diversity of the training data, leading to a more robust model that can better generalize to unseen data. The implementation of these preprocessing techniques is vital for the successful deployment of an image-based machine learning model. 13 Besides the aforementioned tasks, it is also very important to address any bias within the image selection process or any image quality issues that may need to be addressed as noted by Wright et al. and others. 14 2b. Text Data Preprocessing: For NLP tasks (i.e. text data) some of these preprocessing tasks can be grouped into low and high-level tasks 4 and it is the combination and interplay between these two essential groups of tasks that ultimately will best optimize the NLP model. Low-level tasks are those that involve the manipulation of individual words or smaller units of language which often involve the processing of raw text data and include tasks such as tokenization. Tokenization refers to splitting text into individual words or smaller units that enable the machine to then treat each instance as a separate value, analogous to how a machine may use an array of numbers in tabular or image classification tasks. Another important low-level task is the removal of stop words which are words that generally do not add a great deal of value 15 (Fig. 1 ). Stop words are words that are commonly used in a language but do not carry much meaning on their own (such as \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"on\", \"in\", \"at\", \"and\", \"or\", \"but\", etc.). Other low-level NLP tasks include stemming (reducing words to their base form), and part-of-speech tagging (assigning a grammatical role to each word in a sentence) while the high-level tasks involve the interpretation of the overall meaning of a piece of text or the relationship between words and concepts which employ tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. 2c. Audio data preprocessing: Several steps are typically employed to ensure that audio data is suitable for use. Most will start by removing any background noise from the audio recordings, which can be achieved using techniques such as noise reduction or filtering. Another important step is to segment the audio into meaningful chunks, such as individual words or phrases. Feature extraction on the audio data is also performed, such as calculating the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), to extract relevant information and represent the audio data in a format that is suitable for machine learning. 16 2d. Tabular/numerical data preprocessing: The cleaning tasks (i.e., preprocessing) of the numerical data include but are not limited to data noise reduction (e.g., through feature selector tools, etc.), missing data replacement (i.e., imputation) or removal, scaling tasks, text to number conversions, and statistical assessment of the features (e.g., multicollinearity minimization). Collectively these approaches can help optimize the ML training process for tabular studies and ultimately lead to a more generalizable model (Table 2). Many of these have traditionally been confined to various manual (non-automated) approaches but now with the advent of certain powerful data science applications 17 , we are finally able to expedite many of these tedious processes through automated standardized validated approaches (Figs. 2 and 3 ). These applications can provide us with a very user-friendly and scientifically sound tool kit that can readily address the preprocessing tasks noted above. These tools ultimately enable the user to expedite their data cleaning phase within their respective study which not only translates to a faster deployment process but more importantly to a higher likelihood of achieving a more generalizable machine learning model. As noted earlier, these preprocessing tools are very data-type specific which also translates to their corresponding compatible ML algorithms. A better understanding of the inner workings of these ML algorithms and their capabilities and limitations is a key step in the better use of these tools. However, before diving deep into these algorithms, it is also essential to understand the different ML categories that they belong to since that will give us a better big-picture view of how these powerful tools operate. Machine learning categories Machine learning is typically categorized into the following three groups: 1. Supervised Learning, 2. Unsupervised Learning and 3. Reinforcement learning. Supervised learning as the name implies uses data that makes use of labeled targets (human-designated). These can further be subcategorized into classification (i.e. output is a discrete class such as cancer versus no cancer) and regression 21 (i.e. a continuous numerical output such as the predicted cost of a given lab test) 22 . In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not involve any labeled output data (i.e., unlabeled with no or less human input) and is usually used to identify potentially unrecognized clusters, patterns, outliers, or feature subsets. The most common unsupervised methods employed within ML include clustering (e.g., K-means; Fig. 4 ), dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis; PCA), and outlier detection which can sometimes also help identify optimized feature sets. These unsupervised ML tasks along with others can be employed to optimize the data as it feeds into the supervised algorithms which can help enhance their final performance measures. The third category is reinforcement learning 23 which utilizes a trial-and-error process and employs a \u201creward\u201d parameter to continuously evaluate the relationship between its input and output values and decide the best way to optimize itself 24 . Given that reinforcement learning is not currently much used within medicine, we will mainly focus on the supervised methods within this article. For more details on unsupervised and reinforcement learning, please refer to the glossary of terms (Table 1) along with some excellent other cited review articles that further focus on those approaches 31 . It is also important to reemphasize that the choice of the supervised algorithm used for a given study will depend on multiple factors which include but are not limited to the datatype (text, numerical, or image), the data quantity, and ultimately its intended use. Supervised machine learning The concept of a train-test split is fundamental to supervised machine learning studies. Train-test split (e.g., 80\u201320 = 80% training and 20% testing) refers to how a portion of the data is assigned to the training arm of the algorithm (to help map the features to the target of interest) while the leftover test data is then used to validate the performance of the trained model (known as validation testing in the ML world). For more detail on how this works along with other key concepts such as cross-validation and bias-variance tradeoff please refer to the glossary of terms (Table 1) and other excellent review articles (cited below) on this topic. As was noted, supervised learning can be divided into two subcategories, classification, and regression 1 . It is important to note that some ML algorithms are only capable of performing classification tasks (e.g., Logistic Regression), some are regression task-specific (e.g., Linear Regression) and some can do both (e.g., k-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, or Neural Networks). It is also important to note that there are key differences between the statistical performance measures employed in a classification task versus those used in regression modeling. The statistical performance of a model in a classification study is usually confined to a confusion matrix-based approach. This means that the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative measures from the confusion matrix acquired from the ML model are then used to calculate various known statistical metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1, sensitivity, specificity, Matthew's correlation coefficient, etc.). In contrast, regression models are assessed through other performance metrics such as R2, Mean Squared Error, etc. It is also of critical importance that AI/ML applications include accurate, precise, complete, and generalizable information 25 , 26 . Following the concept of \u201cgarbage in, garbage out,\u201d if incorrect or poor-quality data is used the output will likely be a suboptimal ML model that will not likely address our study need. Hence, as was noted earlier, the use of data preprocessing tasks is also essential to minimize such issues 27 . Another key concept around supervised learning is how to minimize the overfitting phenomena (i.e., maximize the generalizability of the ML model) 25 , 26 . This can be achieved through various tasks which include cross-validation along with the use of additional testing datasets (e.g., secondary and tertiary test data 28 to assess generalizability, especially critical for smaller-intermediate sized datasets) 25 . Another important future approach to enhance and maintain generalizability would include the concept of pooling multiple sites in the training process with continued assessments of the models (i.e., a federated ML process) as highlighted by Yang et al. 29 Lastly, once a generalizable model is deployed, it is critical to also constantly assess its performance since data may change over time (especially for certain tabular data) and lead to a deteriorating ML model (a concept known as data drift) 30 . This concept is also not uniform throughout the ML models and very much can be data-type dependent (i.e., tabular data will likely have a higher tendency of drifting while this phenomenon may be less common in certain relatively standardized data such as images). Since in many instances, the data type governs the ML approach (e.g., the gold standard approach for most image studies is convolutional neural network), a better understanding of the various supervised ML algorithms is also key as we embark into this space. Supervised machine learning algorithms Common supervised machine learning algorithms (specifically linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, K-NN, support vector machine, gradient boosting machine, and random forest some of which are depicted in Fig. 5 ) are further described below: Neural networks Collectively these machine-learning algorithms attempt to simulate the structure and function of the human brain. They are typically comprised of various artificial neuronal layers which include an input layer, intervening hidden layer(s), and output layer(s). These can be used for a variety of tasks and can be applied to all data types (i.e., image/video, text, audio, and tabular data). Most common neural networks employed within the ML arena include the Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional neural network (CNN) A convolutional neural network (CNN) is specially optimized for recognizing data motifs and smaller patterns 31 . These include patterns in images, videos, time-series data, genomic data, or other types of data with grid-like characteristics 32 . Generally, CNNs are like other feed-forward neural networks but have an extra layer called a convolutional layer that aids in pattern recognition. A convolution is simply a mathematical operation performed on data fed into that specific detection layer and a kernel 33 . The kernel is a small matrix or window that is initialized to have certain numerical weights in each subframe of the window. This kernel acts as a feature detection filter as it moves over the input and processes that data to produce a resulting feature map through its activation functions. Next, a method called pooling is used to summarize data from the feature detection layer as well as to provide invariance to minute transformations in the input 34 . This method is typically performed in multiple stages interspaced with feature detection layers where the final stage reduces the dimensionality of the input down to a single feature vector. This vector is then used as the input for a dense neural network for various classification purposes 35 , 36 . However, these neural networks are not typically built from scratch for many of our pathology image classification tasks since preexisting optimized neural networks (such as ResNet-50, etc.) can be retrained through the transfer learning approach to expedite this process while providing very capable predictive tools within this space (for more details on transfer learning, see Table 1). Neural networks have revolutionized our machine-learning capabilities within images, video, text (i.e., Natural Language Processing), time series, and certain other complex tasks but they are not always the best solution for all data types. This is especially true within the traditional tabular data space which is one of the most common data types in laboratory and clinical medicine. Although some neural network approaches (e.g., multilayer perceptron) are very promising within the tabular data space, several of the non-neural network algorithms have also been shown to be just as good and sometimes better. These include some of the more traditional methods such as K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, linear regression, polynomial regression, na\u00efve Bayes, and support vector machine along with some more advanced ensemble methods such as random forest and gradient boosting machine. K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is a simple, yet powerful, clustering technique for classification and regression problems. k-NN finds uses in areas such as content retrieval, data mining, and binary or multiclass prediction 37 . In utilizing the k-NN algorithm, the k-parameter is a user-specified constant, which represents the number of nearest neighboring data points. Overall, the k-NN algorithm is highly flexible and can be used for a variety of tasks, including classification and regression tasks. Another benefit to k-NN is that the algorithm is non-parametric, meaning that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution 38 . It is also able to find non-linear relationships since the algorithm itself is non-linear in nature 39 . Unfortunately, k-NN is not without its disadvantages. The algorithm can be computationally expensive, particularly with large data sets. It is also sensitive to poorly selected k values, which may reduce their performance and decrease their accuracy. Finally, k-NN lacks recall, which requires the algorithm to reevaluate data it has seen before. Linear regression This technique is one of the oldest and simplest statistical approaches used in regression studies within supervised machine learning 25 , 40 . In its simplest form, the relationship between a single independent variable (the feature, e.g., height) and the dependent variable (the target, e.g., weight) is evaluated by finding the best-fitted straight line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values (lowest error sum). Multiple linear regression is a variation of this that displays the relationship of a single outcome variable (i.e., target) to two or more independent variables. Certain regression metrics such as root mean square error and coefficient of determination (R2) can then be used to evaluate the performance of these models 41 . R2 describes the amount of variability in the outcome variable that can be explained by the independent variables. In short, how well the regression model fits the data. These regression techniques are relatively simple and efficient in finding linear relationships but have their own shortcomings 40 . Mainly, it is not generally useful when relationships are nonlinear between features and targets 42 . Polynomial regression methods can help in such nonlinear data situations using their input variable exponentials (i.e., the independent variables are mapped to the target variable as nth degree polynomial). Logistic regression In contrast to linear regression which is used for continuous dependent variables (i.e. targets), logistic regression is confined to classification tasks (i.e. targets that are discrete classes) 43 . For a binary classification task, this method produces a probability score that can then be translated to a given binary output (e.g., 0 for negative for cancer and 1 for positive for cancer) through some default threshold (e.g., a 50% or more scores will be assigned to the 1 or positive cancer class while <50% will be placed into the 0 or negative class). The main objective is to find the best-fitting curve that can optimize the separation of the binary class of interest. This approach is not just confined to binary tasks and can also be applied to multiclass problems. However, to apply this approach to multiclass studies one needs to either employ the \u201cOne-vs-all\u201d (also known as One-vs-Rest or OvR) approach or the \u201cSoftMax regression\u201d method (also known as multinomial logistic regression) 25 , 44 . Support vector machines (SVM) By defining an optimized hyperplane this approach enables us to ultimately differentiate the classes of interest (i.e., a classification task) by optimizing the margin that separates these classes. However, a variation of which (Support Vector Regression) can be applied to regression studies 45 . In nonlinear settings, this method can also employ kernels when the data is not easily separable by allowing the data to be transformed into another dimension which can enhance the dividing margins between these classes. Random forest This supervised ensemble tree-based approach can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. Multiple decision trees (hence the forest) are generated at random using features from a data set. Each decision tree makes its prediction or vote. When used for classification, the category with the most votes is chosen as the predicted outcome 46 . In the case of regression, numerical values are averaged together to make a prediction. Theoretically, the more trees there are in the forest, the more accurate the prediction. However, this could also lead to overfitted models that will deteriorate the generalizability 15 . Gradient boosting machine (GBM) This is another ensemble tree-based supervised approach that can be used to solve both regression and classification problems 25 , 47\u201350 . GBM sequentially creates new trees from an ensemble of weaker trees. Every time the ensemble adds a new tree, its model complexity increases, and its overall bias decreases. Theoretically, each new model fits more accurately with new observations which ultimately leads to enhanced overall accuracy. Algorithms based on this boosting principle are effective in reducing bias and variance that occur when applied to small or unbalanced datasets 51 . However, the limited number of tuning parameters may make them more prone to overfitting as compared to other approaches such as the random forest 52 . Summary and future direction In summary, machine learning has the potential of revolutionizing the field of healthcare by enabling the analysis of large and complex datasets. Using different data types, preprocessing techniques, and machine learning algorithms, it is possible to gain valuable insights and make more accurate predictions. With the use of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, a wide range of tasks can be performed, including classification, clustering, and regression. However, in addition to embracing well-established tools, it is also important to continuously embrace new tools and concepts within these arenas which include but are not limited to reinforcement learning, Automated machine learning (Auto-ML), and the synthetic data realm. These exciting new areas (Auto-ML, reinforcement learning, and synthetic data creation and usage) of data science are starting to complement the traditional approaches and will help in expediting the adoption process of the various machine learning tasks within our healthcare space. However, healthcare poses unique challenges. One of which is data drift, which is when input data changes over time, eventually becoming significantly different from the model's original training and validation data. This happens for a variety of reasons but regardless of the cause, it is crucial for us to be aware of this phenomenon and to employ techniques to identify data drift and mitigate its effects. Such techniques include active or continuous learning approaches which allow the model to continue to adapt and improve over time. Within the clinical ML arena, the ML Operations (ML-Ops) arm can help address some of these needs as more and more of these advanced analytic tools are being deployed. The ML-Ops platforms not only address automation and deployment streamlining needs, but also the monitoring and maintenance of the deployed machine learning models. Overall, the combined use of these new tools along with our traditional machine learning approaches has the potential of addressing many of these challenges and greatly improving patient care, paving the way for a more data-driven approach to healthcare.

Department of Environmental Sciences University of Virginia VA 22904 USA Graphical abstract Crowdsourced geotagged social media data and machine learning approaches have emerged as promising tools for mapping ecosystem services, especially cultural ecosystem services that are difficult to assess. Here, we use recreation to show how social media data, machine learning, and spatial analysis techniques can improve our understanding of human-nature interactions and the mapping of recreational ecosystem services. We extracted 80,500 photographs taken in non-urban areas of the Tahoe Central Sierra Initiative project area in California between 2005 and 2019 that were posted to the photo sharing application Flickr and used these as a proxy for recreational visits to the area. Automated image content analysis was used to identify the objects and concepts in the photographs and uncover the types of nature experiences that are important to visitors. Additionally, variable importance, a Random Forest machine learning technique, was used to examine the environmental and landscape variables that drive recreation in the area and to create a classification model that predicts the recreation potential of the entire area based on important variables. The automated image content analysis identified 1,239 unique labels linked to recreation, with mountains, hills, and rocks being the most prominent features (22%). Our Random Forest model indicates that vegetation cover, land cover, elevation, smoke days, and landscape features are major drivers of recreation in the area and are of interest to visitors in the area. The model predicted that 25.9% of the area has the potential to support recreational visits. Most of these recreation potential areas are in protected areas (77.8%), predominantly in conifer forests (66%) and within national forest boundaries, especially the Tahoe National Forest area (37.6%). These results show that recreational ecosystem services vary across landscapes and illustrate the need for improved mapping approaches to determine the provision of ecosystem services in different places. The analysis provides novel insights into the various ways social media data and machine learning techniques can be powerful components of ecosystem service research and how they hold great potential for monitoring and informing management interventions on ecosystem service provision, especially in places with limited traditional onsite visitation data. Keywords Ecosystem service Flickr Machine learning Restoration Image content analysis Google Cloud Vision Data availability We used publicly available data 1 Introduction Human well-being depends on natural capital for important services including fertile soil, fresh water, pollination, flood protection, and climate regulation (Maes et al., 2016; Remme et al., 2021; Daily, 2021; Bratman et al., 2019; Wolsko et al., 2019; Estoque et al., 2021). Mapping is essential to understanding how ecosystems contribute to human well-being and to support policies as well as adaptation strategies to pressures such as land use and climate change (Guo et al., 2023; Burkhard and Maes, 2017; Zhao et al., 2015; Daily and Ruckelshaus, 2022; Dasgupta, 2021). Although quantitative studies of ecosystem services have rapidly grown in recent years, cultural ecosystem services including, nature-based recreation, i.e., recreation that occurs in and depends on the natural environment, are underrepresented in the literature compared to provisioning and regulatory services. In addition to contributing to the well-being of residents and tourists alike, nature-based recreation plays a significant role in national, statewide, and surrounding local economies. However, recreation managers frequently lack basic information on the amount and extent of recreation use, especially at large spatial scales (McDaniel et al., 2021; Manley and Egoh, 2022; Karasov et al., 2020; Tew et al., 2019; Mayer and Woltering., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Sinclair et al., 2018; Sinclair et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Hermes et al., 2018; Yoshimura and Hiura, 2017; Cheng et al 2019; Kosanic and Petzold, 2020; Morse et al., 2022). This is a key gap that can be filled in by studies that expand ecosystem service modeling capabilities to rapidly assess the inherent properties of landscapes, how people interact with their environment, and their preferred nature-based experiences (Rossi et al., 2020; Ghermandi et al., 2020). Due to the subjectivity and intangibility of these cultural services, most studies rely on human interpretation and perception of ecosystems, societal context, individual values, and often the presence of beneficiaries in the physical environment (Guerrero et al., 2016; Tenerelli et al., 2016). As a result, visitation rates, prominent touristic sites, and other proxies are commonly regarded as comprehensive indicators of these cultural ecosystem services (Gosal et al., 2021; Nigussie et al., 2021; Havinga et al., 2020; Tiemann and Ring, 2022; Karasov et al., 2022; Hausmann et al., 2019). For nature-based recreation, most mapping and assessment tools rely on traditional administrative data and direct observations on the number and character of visitors, as well as the spatial and temporal extent of recreational activities (McDaniel et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2020; Oteros-Rozas et al., 2018; Hegetschweiler et al., 2022; Wilkins et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Wartmann et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Llanos-Paez and Acu\u00f1a, 2022). However, such conventional methods are limited in that they can be costly and have not always led to a deeper understanding of important cultural ecosystem services and the contribution of the natural environment to those services, as they are usually site specific, time consuming, and limited in both spatial coverage and content richness. Although a myriad of indicators can be used in research, depending on the objective of the study, most of these indicators do not necessarily capture both the biophysical and social aspects of the service (Manley and Egoh, 2022). This leads to greater uncertainty due to oversimplifications and generalizations of the nonlinear dynamics of ecosystem services. There is therefore an urgent need for studies that improve and spatially refine existing mapping approaches to fill in key data and methodological gaps associated with mapping socio-ecological systems, refine indicators for mapping ecosystem services, and improve our understanding, estimation, and reporting of model uncertainties. Recently, technological advancements in social media, mobile networks, and smartphone technologies have created many streams of data and possibilities to address the data and research gaps in mapping cultural ecosystem services. Billions of posts, including text, videos, and geotagged photographs, with a wealth of spatial and temporal metadata of previously unavailable valuable beneficiary information on human-nature interactions, attitudes, and perceptions of nature based experiences from millions of users are uploaded to social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram every year, revolutionizing ecosystem service research and ecological assessments (Toivonen et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2019; Cardoso et al., 2021; Ruiz-Frau et al., 2020; Mouttaki et al., 2021; Manley and Egoh, 2022; Wilkins et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Havinga et al., 2020; Wood et al., 2020; McDaniel et al., 2021). Although data mining on social media platforms is a fast, large scale, and highly resource efficient source of data with the potential to inform estimates of visitation and improve our ability to assess rapid changes in ecosystems and their use at fine spatial and temporal resolutions compared to traditional monitoring systems, particularly in areas considered too costly or difficult for traditional monitoring, few studies have utilized this valuable resource. For example, several studies on recreation (Hamstead et al., 2018; Mouttaki et al., 2021; Manley and Egoh, 2022; Ciesielski and Stere\u0144czak, 2021; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2020; Long et al., 2021; Karasov et al., 2022; Ghermandi, 2022; Richards and Lavorel, 2022) have used geotagged photographs from Flickr, a platform popular among nature photographers with over 90 million monthly active users (Ruiz-Frau et al., 2020) as a proxy for visitation. Some studies quantify the value of natural environments by predicting the spread of person-days of recreation measured from geotagged photographs posted to Flickr based on the locations of natural habitats and other features that factor into people\u2019s decisions about where to recreate (Sinclair et al., 2018; Lingua et al., 2022). For example, some indicators are focused on speculations that people love to go to mountains and water bodies such as lakes and rivers (and these have been used to map recreational services), but no evidence exists on which elements are most important for recreational activities. However, research in this area is still in its infancy, calling for more studies exploring the utility of big data and crowdsourced social media data for ecosystem service research. While photo content analysis can be conducted manually, this is extremely time consuming (Cardoso et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2019). New methodologies based on artificial intelligence and deep-learning approaches such as machine learning have emerged to potentially fill this gap, maximize the utility of crowdsourced data, and expand ecosystem service modeling capabilities. Machine learning, for example, reduces data processing time and allows for the rapid processing of data, and one of its key strengths is that it can support the analysis of larger datasets than many conventional methods (Reichstein et al., 2019; Scowen et al., 2021; Ochoa and Urbina-Cardona, 2017; Lautenbach et al., 2019; Scowen et al., 2021; Manley and Egoh, 2022). Such advancements allow us to rapidly assess the inherent properties of landscapes, how people interact with their environment, and their preferred nature-based experiences (Rossi et al., 2020; Ghermandi et al., 2020). For example, machine learning algorithms for image analysis such as Google Cloud Vision facilitate the automatic description and classification of photo content (Willcock, et al., 2018; Richards and Tun\u00e7er, 2018; Pal et al., 2020), but are rarely used in the ecosystem service literature. Additionally, algorithms such as Random Forest (a classification and regression tree) allow for the assessment of variable importance (i.e., predictive power) and the selection of relevant indicators for mapping ecosystem service provision (Scowen et al., 2021). Studies utilizing such information are still in their infancy, although they can help determine the factors that influence, for example, recreational visits, which is essential to understanding people\u2019s recreational values and crucial for planners and managers. The main objective of this study is to use newly available techniques and data sources to improve ecosystem service modeling methods and reduce uncertainty in the mapping of cultural services. We specifically use recreational ecosystem services as an example to illustrate how crowdsourced social media data and machine learning can fill in key data and methodological gaps and help improve how we measure, map, and manage ecosystem services on public lands. Secondly, we aim to identify the key pointers and indicators influencing recreational activities that are useful for mapping the recreational potential of landscapes. Lastly, we seek to understand the extent to which California ecosystems, particularly protected areas, provide recreational services. We present a case study in California using visitation data from the photo sharing application Flickr, a Random Forest machine learning technique, automated image content analysis via Google Cloud Vision, environmental variables, and model-based analysis to assess the recreational ecosystem services in areas outside cities in the Tahoe Central Sierra Initiative (TCSI) project area. We use the locations of recreation users\u2019 social media posts to describe how their visits are distributed across the public lands in the TCSI and to evaluate nature-human interactions to uncover the types of nature experiences and unique qualities of landscapes that are important to recreational visitors. The novel approaches developed in this analysis will help land managers and decision makers answer critical questions related to factors influencing recreational visits, indicators for mapping the recreational potential of landscapes, and the impact of management and disturbance on nature-based recreation. Results of this study are crucial for informing the valuation of ecosystem services, improving mapping tools, and reducing uncertainty in the mapping of important areas for recreation. Although we focus on recreational ecosystem services, the methods developed in this study can also be used for identifying other ecosystem services, including provisioning and regulating services across various scales and management contexts. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area Within the Sierran Steppe-Mixed Forest-Coniferous Forest-Alp ecoregion of the Sierra Nevada lies the TCSI (Fig. 1 ), a pioneering 9,700 km2 landscape-level forest restoration effort under the Sierra Nevada Watershed Improvement Program (California Tahoe Conservancy, 2019). The initiative brings together innovative planning, investment, and management tools for multiple restoration initiatives and collaboratives to improve the health and resilience of the Sierra Nevada (Sierra Nevada Conservancy, 2021). A healthy forest is expected to decrease the risk of severe, high-intensity wildfires, and lead to other desirable environmental outcomes, and improve, among other benefits, the recreational potential of the natural areas. Based on the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE) Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) (2015) land cover dataset (Fig. 1), the TCSI is predominantly conifer forest (68.2%). Hardwood forests, shrublands, and water make up 8.8%, 8.5%, and 6.6% of the area, respectively. A smaller proportion of the area is categorized as barren (4.1%), herbaceous (2.1%), urban (1.1%), wetland (0.4%), and agricultural land (0.2%). Six watersheds fall within the TCSI area, namely Yuba, Truckee, Lake Tahoe Basin, Upper Bear, North Fork American, and South Fork American. These forested watersheds contain large amounts of carbon, produce substantial amounts of wood products and clean energy, provide significant fish and wildlife habitat, and are a recreational playground for millions of visitors all year-round (Sierra Nevada Conservancy, 2021). For example, recreation is the foundation of Lake Tahoe Basin\u2019s $5 billion economy (Sierra Nevada Alliance, 2021). Lake Tahoe\u2019s crystal blue waters and snow-capped mountains draw an estimated 8 to 14 million annual visitors each year (Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 2021; The Sierra Nevada Ally, 2021; California Tahoe Conservancy, 2021). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service estimates that over 10.8 million people visit national forests located in the TCSI area (Tahoe National Forest, Eldorado National Forest, Plumas National Forest, and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit) to recreate annually. These visitors spend about $1.18 billion during their trips and contribute more than $828 million towards the wages and income of local businesses (USDA Forest Service, 2020a; USDA Forest Service, 2020b; USDA Forest Service, 2020c; USDA Forest Service, 2020d). Thus, our case study is a relevant baseline to characterize the current provision of ecosystem services such as nature-based recreation in the area that is home to approximately 200,000 people located in and around the ten cities within the TCSI boundary (Tahoe Truckee Community Foundation, 2020). 2.2 Data collection 2.2.1 Obtaining visitation data from Flickr Flickr photographs taken between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2019 in the TCSI were retrieved by querying the Flickr Application Programming Interface (API) using Python scripts. An API is an interface that developers can access to perform various tasks, which also enables different applications to communicate with each other (Robillard, 2009). We ended our photograph search in 2019 to avoid the effects of COVID-19-related travel restrictions (i.e., stay at home orders, lockdown orders) on recreational visits. We specifically used the dates the photographs were taken and a bounding box of coordinates defining the boundary of the TCSI to search for all geolocated posts (based on the latitude and longitude associated with each photograph). We chose Flickr because of easy access to public content through its API. Additionally, Wood et al. (2013) observed that the number of recreators who visit a location annually is related to the number of photographs taken in the same area and uploaded to the Flickr database at 836 visitor attractions worldwide. We excluded urban areas from the analysis to estimate recreational visits in natural landscapes outside cities. To do this, we filtered the resulting Flickr records using a United States Census Bureau (2021) urban area shapefile to discard any photographs taken within an urban area. This retained a unique dataset of photographs taken in the non-urban areas of the TCSI area, which were then downloaded along with their metadata. The data downloaded included the location, date, and time the photograph was taken, as well as the web address of the web page containing the photograph and details about the photographer, including their unique identifier and origin based on the location listed on their online profiles. Fig. 2 shows the spatial distribution of the photographs considered in the study and their locations across the USDA Forest Service national forest boundaries (USDA Forest Service, 2021) in the TCSI. 2.2.2 Selection of environmental variables Understanding how different landscape features contribute to ecosystem service provision is essential for management and planning. It is assumed that the potential of a landscape to provide recreational opportunities is a function of its attractiveness to people (Schirpke et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2021). To understand the environmental features that might contribute to this aesthetic appeal and to assess the importance of different variables in influencing recreational activities in the TCSI focal area, potential explanatory variables considered to factor into people\u2019s decisions about where to recreate were identified from the literature. This includes studies by Scholte et al. (2018), Oteros-Rozas et al. (2018), Paracchini et al. (2014), Gr\u00eat-Regamey et al. (2015), Egoh et al. (2012), Casado-Arzuaga et al. (2014), and Zulian et al. (2013). These variables include characteristics of both the biophysical environment, such as vegetation cover, and infrastructure, such as roads, that promote the recreational opportunity of landscapes, as well as a series of site and context-specific variables. Our variables of interest included: land cover types; habitat diversity; vegetation and forest cover; number of smoke days; elevation; presence and distance to access routes (roads, rail, and trails); presence of flowers, recreational sites, protected areas, and parks; population density; and presence and proportion of water (lakes and other water bodies). Appendix Table 1 lists all datasets used in the analysis along with their sources. After downloading the necessary datasets for the study area, spatial analysis techniques, including the zonal tool in Geographic Information System software ArcMap\u00ae (version 10.3), were used to summarize the data layers and the Flickr visitation data across one-kilometer grids of the study area created using the ArcGIS geoprocessing tool (https://pro.arcgis.com/). 2.3 Data analysis 2.3.1 Automated image content analysis using Google Cloud Vision API To uncover the types of nature experiences and unique ecosystems, wildlife, and scenic qualities of landscapes that are important to recreational visitors in the TCSI, we used the automated content analysis tool, Google Cloud Vision (https://cloud.google.com/vision). Google Cloud Vision is a machine learning algorithm with the ability to detect broad sets of categories within an image, including labels, text, faces, landmarks, logos, and image properties, but it is rarely used in ecosystem service research. In our analysis, this was useful for identifying the types of nature most photographed by visitors to the TCSI and useful for mapping hotspots of different categories of human-nature interactions across different landscapes. For each Flickr photograph downloaded for the TCSI, we extracted the web address of the photograph from the metadata and then passed this web address to the Google Cloud Vision API label detection function using the R package \u2018googleCloudVisionR\u2019 (Pal et al., 2020). The API returned a list of labels for each photograph and a confidence score, which ranges from 0 (no confidence) to 1 (very high confidence) associated with each label. Following Runge et al. (2020), we limited our analysis to any labels with a score of 0.6 or higher up to a maximum of 20 labels for each photograph (the median number of labels per photograph in our dataset is 20). Our analysis focuses on nature-based recreation, i.e., recreational activities involving physical and experiential interactions with the natural environment (Cortinovis et al., 2018). As such, we excluded labels associated with the built environment or agricultural activities, including those depicting agricultural crops, food, plantations, and livestock. We manually categorized all labels and classified them into ten categories that depict: 1) trees; 2) other vegetation types; 3) accessibility; 4) wildlife; 5) rocks, hills, and mountains; 6) water; 7) recreational activities; 8) accommodation; 9) general landscape features; and 10) attractions (Appendix Table 2). To assess the performance and consistency of the classification criteria of Google Cloud Vision as well as to reduce the subjectivity associated with content analysis, we performed manual content analysis on a random sample of 385 photographs determined using the Cochran formula (Cochran, 1963; Israel, 1992) to evaluate Google Cloud Vision\u2019s performance in identifying labels from photographs. Cohen\u2019s Kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) via the R package \u2018irr\u2019 (Gamer et al., 2012) was used to assess the level of agreement between the manual coding and Google Cloud Vision derived labels. 2.3.2 Environmental variable analysis using machine learning The resolution of the geotagged photographs can be leveraged to assess the importance of different variables in influencing recreational activities in the area. Here, we used the non-urban Flickr records for 2012, one of the years with the highest visitation (n = 8,350), in combination with the potential explanatory environmental and landscape variables considered to factor into people\u2019s decisions about where to recreate and those that might contribute to the potential of a landscape to provide opportunities for recreation identified from the literature (see list in Appendix Table 1). First, we examined these candidate variables for correlation and ran collinearity diagnostics to detect and filter highly correlated variables. Collinearity, a situation where two variables have near perfect linear combinations of one another, and multicollinearity, which involves more than two variables, make it difficult to come up with reliable estimates of the individual coefficients and potentially result in incorrect conclusions about the relationship between outcome and predictor variables (Hebbali, 2020). We used the \u2018olsrr\u2019 package in R (Hebbali, 2020) to measure the presence of collinearity and multicollinearity. We specifically examined the correlation matrix for predictor variables that correlate highly and computed the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), a measure of how much the variance of the estimated regression coefficient is inflated by the existence of correlation among the predictor variables in the model. We also estimated the tolerance statistic, which quantifies the percentage of variance in the predictor that cannot be accounted for by other predictors, and computed Eigenvalues, which show the variance of each linear combination. Variables that were found to be highly correlated were removed from the analysis. Based on the 2012 presence and absence of visitation data from Flickr for each 1 km grid (Fig. 3 ) and the spatial layers of the explanatory variables, the Forest-based Classification and Regression toolset in ArcGIS Pro was used to train and construct a classification model for predicting the presence or absence of recreational visits in different areas based on the associated explanatory variables. We specifically left out the area covered by Lake Tahoe and focused on 875 grids that had visitation and an equal number of randomly selected grids that had no visitation. The Forest-based Classification and Regression tool utilizes Random Forest, a supervised machine learning method that uses predefined input-output pairs to train a model and derive outputs based on the known values provided as part of a training dataset (ESRI, 2021). Unlike in unsupervised learning processes where there is no specific feedback supplied for input data and the machine learning algorithm detects patterns, in supervised learning, the user specifies which variables (i.e., outputs) are considered dependent on others (i.e., inputs) (Hastie et al., 2009; Mjolsness and DeCoste, 2001). Random Forest has been shown to perform comparatively as well as traditional spatial methods and is effective at solving spatial problems (Breiman, 2001; Fox et al., 2020; Manley and Egoh, 2022). For example, Manley and Egoh (2022) used social media data from Flickr along with social and biophysical data to create a Random Forest regression model that connects the summer demand for recreational ecosystem services to social, environmental, and climate variables in California. Random Forest can also handle many predictors, is robust to correlated explanatory variables, and allows for varying functional relationships between the predictor and response variables (Larson et al., 2018). In addition to being a data driven model that can model without making a priori assumptions about the input data, the Random Forest algorithm adds a large amount of randomness into the regression analysis and effectively avoids model overfitting (Manley and Egoh, 2022; Willcock et al., 2018; Rammer and Seidl, 2019; Scowen et al., 2021). This is a key advantage of the algorithm for our analysis, considering that recreation is based upon a large set of complexly interacting variables, which makes it vulnerable to overfitting. 2.3.3 Making predictions about visitation in the TCSI After training a Random Forest model and assessing its accuracy, it can then be used to generate predictions of unknown values in a dataset that has the same associated explanatory variables (ESRI, 2021). In the Forest-based Classification and Regression toolset, predictions can be performed for both categorical variables (classification) and continuous variables (regression). In addition, the toolset also calculates the importance of each explanatory variable to the model and reports variables with the top twenty importance scores, helping us better understand which variables drive the results of the model. We trained and assessed various classification models based on the presence and absence of visitation data (Fig. 3), as well as the potential explanatory variables of visitation (Appendix Table 1), in the Forest-based Classification and Regression toolset before selecting the best classification model. The best model was then used in predict mode to map the recreational potential of different areas in the TCSI for recreational visits (i.e., the presence or absence of recreational visits). This was achieved by assigning the same explanatory variables used to train the model to all grid locations in the TCSI. 3 Results The analysis was able to illustrate how crowdsourced geotagged data from Flickr and machine learning techniques, together with environmental variables and model-based analysis, can be used to support assessments looking at cultural ecosystem services such as recreation in natural lands. The following sections present results for the various analyses undertaken to illustrate how these approaches can be leveraged to identify the types of nature experiences and unique qualities of landscapes that are important to recreational visitors, identify key variables influencing recreational activities in the TCSI that are useful for mapping the recreational potential of natural lands, and illustrate the recreation potential of natural lands in the TCSI. 3.1 Distribution of Flickr photographs taken in the TCSI Our analysis retained a unique dataset of 80,500 photographs taken in non-urban areas of the TCSI area uploaded by approximately 5,000 users. The median number of photographs taken by each photographer was 3, and 86% of photographers uploaded fewer than 20 photographs. The maximum number of photographs uploaded by a single photographer was 8,244 (only 4 photographers uploaded more than 1,000 photographs). From the spatial distribution of the photographs (Fig. 2), it can be observed that there is some clustering of the photographs, for example, at focal points and along linear features such as access routes. 3.2 Nature experiences and unique qualities of landscapes that are important to visitors from image content analysis The Google Cloud Vision algorithm was able to access 80,050 photographs and assign 4,561 unique labels to them. These labels included descriptors of physical objects (e.g., \u2018tree\u2019, \u2018woody plant\u2019, and \u2018water\u2019), activities (e.g., \u2018skiing\u2019, \u2018hiking\u2019, and \u2018backpacking\u2019), and concepts such as \u2018leisure\u2019 and \u2018fun\u2019. Of all labels, only 1,239 were linked to recreation. Fig. 4 shows the 1,239 labels summarized across the ten categories described in Appendix Table 2 for all photographs (up to a maximum of 20 labels each). For each category, the top five labels obtained from the analysis are illustrated in the table. Overall, photographs depicting mountains, hills, and rocks had the greatest percentage contribution to labels retrieved (22%), followed by those focusing on trees (16%), water (16%), general landscape views (14%), and other vegetation (14%). Cohen\u2019s Kappa resulted in a good agreement (93%) between the manual coding and Google Cloud Vision derived labels (Kappa statistic = 0.918), indicating that Google Cloud Vision automatically describes and classifies photo content with a high level of accuracy. 3.3 Key environmental variables for mapping the recreational potential of natural lands Our multicollinearity tests yielded VIF values within tolerance (VIF less than 10 with a tolerance statistic not less than zero), and no presence of small eigenvalues (close to zero) which would have indicated multicollinearity. However, the pairwise correlations between the number of parks and presence of parks, majority existing vegetation cover and majority vegetation type, variety of existing vegetation type and variety of existing vegetation cover, change in smoke days, and number of smoke days were greater than 0.75, implying some degree of correlation. Our final classification model yielded an accuracy of 0.99 after filtering and was able to predict the presence and absence of recreational visits based on the given training dataset. After training the Random Forest model, results show that vegetation cover (both majority and variety) and variety of land cover types have the most predictive power. The number of smoke days, elevation, and distance to rail have also proven to be important factors in determining recreational visits in the TCSI. The top variables found to significantly affect the presence or absence of recreational visits to the TCSI are shown in Table 1 . Variables with high \u201cimportance\u201d are drivers of the outcome in the model, and their values have a significant impact on predicting the presence or absence of visitation in the TCSI. According to ESRI (2021), importance is calculated using Gini coefficients and can be thought of as the number of times a variable is responsible for a split in the decision tree and the impact of that split divided by the number of trees. The percentage (%) column highlights the percentage of the total sum of Gini coefficients for each variable. 3.4 Recreational potential of the TCSI\u2019s natural lands Our Random Forest classification model was able to predict the presence and absence of visitation in different areas across the TCSI (Fig. 5 ). Of the 9,531 1-km grids used in the analysis, 2,471 (25.9%) were predicted to have the potential to support recreational visits in the TCSI. Most of the grids with high recreation potential are predominantly in protected areas (77.8%) listed in the California Protected Areas Database (GreenInfo Network, 2021). These high recreation potential areas are mainly located in conifer forests (66%), shrublands (13%), and barren lands (7%). A smaller proportion of the high recreation potential grids occur over hardwood forest (5%), water (5%), herbaceous cover (3%), and wetland (1%) land cover categories. Most of the grids predicted for recreational visits fall within the Tahoe National Forest (37.6%), Eldorado National Forest (33.4%), and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (24.8%). Few grids are predicted for recreation in areas outside of USDA Forest Service national forest boundaries (11.4%) and Plumas National Forest (1.3%). 4 Discussion We set out to explore the utility of crowdsourced social media data and machine learning techniques to improve our understanding and mapping of ecosystem services, particularly recreational ecosystem services in natural lands. Recently, there have been concerted efforts to utilize social media data and emerging artificial intelligence in assessing cultural ecosystem services such as recreation. Availability and access to crowdsourced data provide an opportunity to connect the biophysical and social aspects of ecosystem services, a key gap that has previously resulted in an incomplete understanding of the impacts of ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide to human well-being (Manley and Egoh, 2022). Several studies, including Sonter et al. (2016), Arslan and \u00d6r\u00fcc\u00fc (2021), Mancini et al. (2018), Richards and Tun\u00e7er (2018), Cheng et al. (2019), Cardoso et al. (2021), and Zhang et al. (2021), have used geo-tagged photographs from social media to understand the spatial patterns of nature-based recreational visits. However, as our analysis illustrates, there are other important possibilities besides mapping visitation that social media data offers to ecosystem service research that are yet to be tapped upon. For example, our study adds to the few studies that have included image content analysis to understand the unique qualities of the environment that are of most interest to people or sought to refine the indicators used for mapping the recreational potential of landscapes (Richards and Tun\u00e7er, 2018; Figueroa-Alfaro and Tang, 2017). This is particularly important for improving methods that reduce uncertainty in the mapping of ecosystem services. Non-market valuation approaches such as the travel cost method, for example, typically rely on limited administrative data and surveys to get visitation data (Nyelele et al., 2023; Bowker et al., 2009). As such, approaches such as ours that take advantage of emerging data sources and methodologies are critical in filling important gaps and expanding ecosystem service modeling capabilities to rapidly assess the inherent properties of landscapes, how people interact with their environment, and their preferred nature-based experiences (Rossi et al., 2020; Ghermandi et al., 2020). Additionally, algorithms such as Random Forest allow for the assessment and selection of relevant indicators for mapping ecosystem service provision (Scowen et al., 2021). Such information can help determine the factors that influence, for example, recreational visits, which is essential to understanding people\u2019s recreational values and crucial for planners and managers. With growing demand for outdoor recreation and increasing pressure on parks and protected areas, such an analysis can be used to influence decision making around the management of natural areas for ecosystem service provision. Content analysis provides us an opportunity to look beyond photograph density in assessing the recreational potential of sites and instead explore people\u2019s preferences and features of the environment that attract their attention when they recreate. Our image content analysis shows that mountains, hills, and rocks were either more common, more noticeable, or of greater interest to the visitor community, followed by trees, water, and general landscape views of the area. This result is also mirrored in the results of the variable importance analysis, which identified vegetation cover, land cover, and elevation as some of the most important variables for predicting recreational visits. This is not surprising considering that the Sierra Nevada contains the headwaters of 24 major river basins, has higher elevations, and has a unique character of forests defined by tall trees, a relatively mild climate, and low forest density (Bales et al., 2011). Lake Tahoe, a year-round outdoor paradise, is not only one of the largest alpine lakes anywhere but is also one of the highest lakes, attracting hikers to its tall peaks (Freel Peak, Monument Peak, Pyramid Peak, and Mount Tallac) that offer a picturesque view of the lake below. Although these findings are in line with observations by van Zanten (2016) and Oteros-Rozas et al. (2018) that some of the best predictors of recreational value are geomorphological features such as hills and mountains, interestingly, few studies (Pe\u00f1a et al., 2015; Paracchini et al., 2014; Tenerelli et al., 2016; Weyland and Laterra, 2014) have included them as important determinants of recreational activity. The variable importance analysis sought to identify key pointers and indicators influencing recreational activities that are useful for mapping the recreational potential of landscapes. Previous studies have used several indicators such as accessibility (e.g., proximity to roads), presence of recreational outdoor opportunities, scenic beauty, and visitor numbers to map recreational services (Sch\u00e4gner et al., 2016; Egoh et al., 2012; Byczek et al., 2018; Paracchini et al., 2014). Our variable importance results show that although these factors are important, heterogeneity may play a bigger role in choosing where to recreate. We found two factors associated with heterogeneity (variety of vegetation cover and variety of land cover types) to be the most important factors. Interestingly, Harrison et al. (2014) found a very strong relationship between recreational services and biodiversity, in particular species richness and abundance. However, very few studies have used species richness or vegetation richness as a proxy for mapping recreational services except in cases such as hunting and angling (Egoh et al., 2012; Villamagna et al., 2014; Grima et al., 2019). Although our image content analysis did not show accessibility as an important driver of recreation, similar to Paracchini et al. (2014) and mostly listed in Egoh et al. (2012), accessibility, specifically distance to rail, came up as an important variable in the variable importance analysis. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the photographs (Fig. 2) highlights that photograph locations follow a linear pattern, implying that areas along access routes, for example, roads, trails, and other paths, that are easily accessible are also easier to photograph. This is not surprising, as distance from roads and viewsheds has been used to map recreational services (Reyers et al., 2009; Karasov et al., 2020; Ihtimanski et al., 2020), implying that even though people prefer undisturbed and pristine areas, they cannot reach those areas without access routes. One of the most interesting results from the variable importance analysis is the importance of smoke days in predicting visitation. Climatic variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, as well as air quality, are hardly included in mapping recreational services but are some of the most important aspects that people consider when going out. California is marred with frequent wildfires (Seipp et al., 2023), and smoke has increasingly become a fixture on the Western landscape, making recreational activities unattractive on certain days due to bad air quality linked to severe human health impacts and often resulting in forest and park closures. For example, Gellman et al. (2022) found that campers on public lands experience at least 400,000 days of wildfire smoke each year on public lands in the western USA. Such an analysis is helpful in identifying and refining important indicators for mapping certain services and reducing the uncertainty in our mapping approaches. Random Forest allowed us to test and then use important explanatory variables shown to be influential in determining recreational activities in the TCSI to predict the presence or absence of recreational visitation in the area. Merrill et al. (2020) were also able to develop a Random Forest-based model to predict visitation to a range of water recreation areas using cellphone data and other explanatory variables in New England, USA. Manley and Egoh (2022) also demonstrate the effectiveness of Random Forest in predicting the impact of different environmental and climatic factors on recreational ecosystem services in California. Our focus was not on estimating absolute visitation numbers since our Flickr dataset does not capture all the recreational visits to the area. Instead, we focused on using social media-based visitation data and machine learning to determine whether an area within the TCSI has the potential to \u201chost\u201d recreational visits, given the unique characteristics of the landscape. It is interesting to note that while our classification and prediction model were based on 2012 Flickr visitation data, our predicted presence and absence of visitation map (Fig. 5) mimics the observed overall visitation patterns for 2005-2019 depicted on Fig. 2. This adds confidence to the accuracy of our model to predict areas that can support recreation based on the explanatory variables we used. Interestingly, most of the areas predicted to host recreational visits fall mainly within national forest boundaries and in protected areas. Such findings support calls for the conservation and protection of outstanding ecosystems to retain important functions for conserving valued species, habitats, and landscapes in their natural or semi-natural state. Our methodology and results can be used to highlight key areas that should be preserved for an array of conservation and cultural ecosystem services and benefits, including those related to recreation. While the approach used in the analysis improves our understanding of recreational ecosystem services and demonstrates the utility of publicly available datasets and machine learning techniques in mapping cultural ecosystem services such as recreation, it is not without limitations. Firstly, unlike field surveys, social media data is based on inference, considering that the motivation for sharing photographs is not known and the initial purpose of social media is not for ecosystem services research. Additionally, approaches such as ours relying on social media data assume that a visit to the area is only for the purpose of recreation and do not account for the people who travel through the area to recreate in other places. To overcome this, we filtered photographs to focus on those taken in natural lands and looked at the image content to obtain labels related to nature-based recreation. Other studies (e.g., Schirpke et al., 2021; Hirahara, 2021) have overcome this limitation through text analysis of user generated tags from the photograph metadata or essays written by forest recreation participants to obtain deeper insights into people\u2019s experiences, preferences, or emotions related to cultural ecosystem services such as recreation. A further potential limitation of relying on social media data for proxy counts of visitation, more specifically a single photograph platform (Flickr), is that the number of observations provided is sometimes too low to adequately represent visitor rates in natural areas. Social media might underestimate the actual visitation as a smaller proportion of people visiting parks and other recreation locations may post images to Flickr (Nyelele et al., 2023; Hausmann et al., 2019; Wood et al., 2013; Toivonen et al., 2019). Although Flickr is the most popular source of geotagged photographs for cultural ecosystem service research due to its global popularity and open API (Ruiz-Frau et al., 2020), studies can explore how to include data from multiple social media data streams, especially popular streams such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter that have better data but have restricted access through their APIs. Additionally, Flickr has previously been validated as an effective proxy of visitation (Wood et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2020; Manley and Egoh, 2022), and thus we can deduce trends in the use and demand of ecosystem services based on the data. While we cannot completely rule out errors in the datasets and techniques used in our analysis, our accuracy assessment, specifically the weighted Cohen\u2019s Kappa agreement index between the manual and automated classification (93%), indicates a good result of the automated content analysis. It must be stressed that the particular focus of this study was to show a methodology that could be used in different areas where crowdsourced data, environmental data, and landscape data can be obtained and that may be applicable to other ecosystem services. Although our analysis and findings may be site specific, they can be extended to other areas and scales. This will help improve forest and land use management and decision making including the identification of focal areas for prioritizing management actions that improve ecosystem service provision. Our study has illustrated how the concurrent use of crowdsourced social media data and machine learning has great potential to close key data and methodological gaps in ecosystem service research by improving estimates of visitation and the ability to assess changes in recreation use. Future work can build on this work and harness geotagged social media data from a variety of platforms and machine learning resources to improve estimates of visitation trends across space and time that can be used to inform assessments and management actions related to ecosystem service provision. There is also the potential to incorporate big data and social media data to study and improve the valuation of recreational ecosystem services, and other cultural ecosystem services as well as provisioning and regulating services across various scales and management contexts. This will be important in facilitating sustainable land use management and informing policy and decision making. 5 Conclusions Using recreation as an example, this study provides novel insights into the variety of ways social media and machine learning can be used to improve the mapping of cultural ecosystem services that rely on visitation estimates, especially in places with limited traditional onsite visitation data. Results from the study reveal that recreational visits are related to a variety of environmental and landscape characteristics of the area, including vegetation cover, elevation, landforms, and smoke days. This supports the conclusion that recreational ecosystem services from natural lands are not the same across landscapes, and improved mapping approaches are needed to determine the provision of ecosystem services across landscapes. Additionally, the study has demonstrated how environmental and landscape variables deemed as important possible drivers of recreational visits can be used to map recreational potential in the absence of visitation data, filling in key data availability gaps in ecosystem service research. Furthermore, results from the image content analysis have helped us evaluate nature-human interactions to uncover the types of nature experiences and unique qualities of landscapes that are important to recreational visitors, providing us with an additional layer of information that has the potential to guide more decision-making regarding areas to focus on for management action and forest restoration activities that enhance and protect the recreational opportunities that are important to visitors. Although the study is based on a prototype area, the TCSI, with a particular focus on non-urban areas, the methodological and conceptual approaches of this analysis can be used to advance the mapping of recreational ecosystem services as well as other ecosystem services and the planning and evaluation of priority action by leveraging on social media and machine learning approaches to improve ecosystem service provision, assessment, and mapping of ecosystem services in different landscapes.

Machine learning is extensively utilized for predicting creep rupture of high-temperature steels. Recently, five soft-constrained machine learning algorithms (SCMLAs) have been developed to enhance the extrapolation capabilities of machine learning. These SCMLAs were applied to the austenitic steel Sanicro 25, showing their potential. To improve SCMLAs, this study has introduced new guidelines that address temperature culling within the input range and temperature extrapolation beyond the input range. Leveraging these guidelines, the SCMLAs were extended to various austenitic and martensitic stainless steels. The predicted results of TP316H, the data of which is representative of austenitic stainless steels, were validated through error estimates. Furthermore, notable agreement has been reached for temperature culling and temperature extrapolation, as demonstrated for TP91 and TP92 martensitic steels. The effects of single casts and the temperature dependence of the predictions have been analyzed for the studied materials. Consistent results can be readily achieved through systematic evaluations of SCMLAs for extrapolating up to 300,000 h or three times the maximum experimental rupture time for the studied materials. It is demonstrated that SCMLAs can provide reliable creep rupture life prediction across various high-temperature materials. Keywords Creep rupture extrapolation Soft-constrained machine learning Soft-constrained neural network Stainless steels Error estimate 1 Introduction Creep properties play a vital role in engineering materials serving at high temperatures and stresses for a long time, such as fossil fuel-fired, petrochemical, and nuclear power plants. The accurate prediction of creep rupture behavior has a long history; many models have been developed to address this challenge. Empirical or phenomenological models, such as the Norton equation, Time-Temperature Parameters (TTP), and the Wilshire Equation, have gained prominence due to their simplicity and ability to yield good fits to observations. However, these methods rely on multiple adjustable parameters and, in general, lack a solid theoretical foundation. In contrast, fundamental models for predicting creep rupture of fcc metals have been proposed [1\u20136] but are not yet widely used in spite of their potential. They require a quantitative description of the operating mechanisms, which are not always available. Some common TTPs generally assume an approximately linear relationship between creep rupture life (t R) and temperature (T K), i.e., log(t R) vs. 1/T K, implying a constant activation energy (Q c) for creep rupture [7\u20139]. However, this does not always hold, for example for TP91 (9Cr1MoVNb) steels [8]. In practice, it is often observed that there is a change in Q c at longer times, indicating alterations of the creep rupture mechanisms [8,10], which may be attributed to particle coarsening or substructure coarsening [10]. Consequently, common TTPs may overestimate the creep rupture life. To mitigate this overestimation, Maruyama et al. proposed a multiregion analysis approach based on the stress exponent and activation energy. The multiregion analysis has been successfully applied to single casts of various materials such as austenitic stainless steels TP316H [7], high Cr steels TP91 [8,9,11] and TP92 (9Cr1.8W0.5MoVNb) [10]. On the other hand, machine Learning algorithms, such as Neural Networks (NNs), present a compelling alternative to conventional empirical methods for analyzing creep rupture data due to their flexibility. These algorithms eliminate the need to presuppose a specific function, thus empowering the method to handle complex datasets. Machine learning algorithms have found extensive applications in resolving a multitude of engineering challenges involving complex interactions, including creep [12\u201322]. For instance, Hakimian et al. [23] employed four machine learning classifiers (random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and bagging classifier) to predict the corrosion behavior of stainless steels, where they found that DT and bagging classifiers exhibited superior accuracy. Zhao et al. [24] leveraged machine learning algorithms across four categories (linear regression, support vector regression, regression tree, and Gaussian process regression) to search for better properties of Cu alloys using unsatisfactory results from trial-and-error tests. In the realm of creep behavior prediction, machine learning algorithms have been extensively used for predicting creep rupture life of austenitic stainless steels [13,17,25,26], 9 % Cr steels [14], and Ni-base superalloys [16]. Notably, Shin et al. [13] employed synthetic input features, encompassing precipitates (including NbC and M23C6) computed using ThermoCalc and the interaction of alloying elements with phases and temperatures, to predict the creep properties of austenitic stainless steels, utilizing five machine learning algorithms (RF, linear regression, nearest neighbor, kernel ridge, and Bayesian ridge). It is important to bear in mind that while machine learning algorithms are primarily designed for interpolation within datasets; they are often used for extrapolation as well, leading to a longstanding debate about their extrapolation capabilities. Many researchers argue that the NN cannot be used for extrapolation, but only interpolation [27\u201329]. Conversely, some researchers have attempted to use NN as extrapolators [30\u201333]. Applying common machine learning algorithms can manage interpolation errors in data, yet they may result in considerable extrapolation errors. This has recently been demonstrated for creep rupture data, where the use of common machine learning algorithms leads to predictions that deviate from physical reality [19,20]. However, by integrating constrained requirements on common machine learning algorithms, reasonable extrapolation results have been obtained [19\u201321]. Meanwhile, the concept of Physics-Constrained NN (PCNN) has emerged, offering improved generalization and extrapolation capabilities by combining the common NN with underlying physical principles [34\u201337]. By integrating constraints on the derivatives of the creep rupture curves, it can be assured that the predicted creep rupture curves show a physically correct behavior [19\u201322]. This assertion has been validated by applying post-assessment tests (PATS) recommended by European Creep Collaborative Committee (ECCC). The inclusion of these constraints helps prevent unphysical fitting and extrapolation. New algorithms have been developed for the constrained NN and TTP [19\u201322] by encoding the constraints into the common NN or TTP frameworks. Five soft-constrained machine learning algorithms (SCMLAs) have been formulated and implemented for the austenitic stainless steel Sanicro 25, where the constrained requirements on the first and second derivatives of the creep rupture curves are integrated into conventional machine learning algorithms [20]. In addition to the constrained derivatives, systematic methods for evaluating the stability, accuracy, and consistency of the results have been introduced. This approach goes beyond the sole reliance on the regression coefficient and mean squared error of the common machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the distribution of the prediction errors generated by the SCMLAs has been quantitatively analyzed and applied in the assessment of the remanent creep life of high-temperature alloys [21]. SCMLAs have been systematically employed for the analysis of an advanced commercial austenitic stainless steel, Sanicro 25 [20]. However, the dataset for Sanicro 25 is typically well-organized, which may not be representative of most austenitic stainless steels, especially the common grades like TP316H and TP321H with multiple casts. The primary source of the significant scattering observed in experimental data, especially the data reported by the National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS, Japan), is the cast-to-cast variation [9]. In light of these considerations, in this study, we will analyze all casts and single casts for the studied materials, and evaluate the temperature dependence of creep rupture life predictions, according to the post-assessment tests proposed by Maruyama et al. [8\u201310]. This study aims to extend the applications of SCMLAs to various austenitic stainless steels and martensitic stainless steels, encompassing prediction and extrapolation of creep rupture life. The effects of single casts and the temperature dependence of the predictions will be evaluated. Furthermore, the stability of SCMLAs will be assessed through the selective elimination of specific temperatures, including temperature within the experimental range and the highest temperature, an approach referred to as temperature culling and extrapolation. Accordingly, this study will introduce a new guideline for temperature culling and extrapolation. 2 Methods 2.1 Soft-constrained machine learning algorithms Settings of machine learning algorithms, including Neural Networks (NN), can be found in various references [16,25,30,31] and programming languages or software like MATLAB and Python. In this study, the aforementioned five soft-constrained machine learning algorithms (SCMLAs) will be employed. Detailed explanations of the principles of these algorithms are provided in Ref. [20]; thus, only essential information will be summarized here. Five common machine learning algorithms were adopted, including three variants of backpropagation NN: Bayesian Regularization NN (BRNN), Levenberg-Marquardt NN (LMNN), and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Quasi-Newton NN (BFGNN), along with two forms of machine regression (MR): Limited-memory BFGSNNMR (LBFGSNNMR) and Support Vector MR (SVMR). Within these common machine learning algorithms, the training process for LMNN and BFGNN automatically halts when generalization gives no further improvement, indicated by a decrease in mean squared error for validation samples. As for BRNN, training ceases according to adaptive weight minimization (regularization). Bayesian regularization expands the loss function in the training process to search for the optimum model for both the minimal error and the minimal weights [38]. SVMR cross-validates a support vector machine regression model using various kernel functions. LBFGSNNMR trains a neural network for regression, with an activation function in the hidden layer. According to physical principles, creep rupture life must decrease with increasing stress at a given temperature for creep rupture curves. This implies that the first derivative of the rupture curve must be negative, while the second derivative is also negative. An exception to this rule is the so-called sigmoidal behavior, which requires special analysis but is not considered here. The requirements on the first and second derivatives of the predicted creep rupture curves are given as follows [19\u201322]: (1) m = d log t R d log \u03c3 \u2265 1.5 ; d 2 log t R d log \u03c3 2 \u2264 0 ; d log t R d log T \u2264 0 ; where t R is the rupture time, \u03c3 the creep stress, and T the absolute temperature. In this study and in the authors' prior work [20,21], the term \u2018log\u2019 pertains to the logarithm with a base of 10. m is the inverse of the slope of the creep rupture curve with a minus sign for convenient illustration. The minimum m value helps ensure that the creep rupture curves are not too steep for extrapolation at extended times. The inclusion of the second derivative serves to eliminate oscillations or unphysical extrapolation of the predicted curves. Additionally, the temperature-related derivative prevents the occurrence of crossovers or bending back of the predicted curves at varying temperatures. The significance of the constraints has been well documented in Refs. [20,21]. To generate reasonable creep rupture life prediction and extrapolation, the constrained derivatives in eq. (1) are integrated with the five common machine learning algorithms, thereby creating the soft-constrained machine learning algorithms (SCMLAs), i.e. SC BRNN, SC LMNN, SC BFGNN, SC LBFGSNNMR, and SC SVMR [20]. The parameter configurations during the training and optimization of SCMLAs are detailed in Table 1 . The input parameters are stress and temperature, and the output is the creep rupture life, all in logarithmic form with a base of 10. For creep rupture prediction, one hidden layer is employed, in accordance with the findings that one hidden layer is usually sufficient to model the creep behavior [19,20,39]. The architecture used for the NNs is 2-n-1, where n is the number of neurons in the hidden layer. Regarding the datasets, they are randomly divided in a ratio of 70:15:15 for training, validation, and testing for NNs. 2.2 Stability and extrapolation guidelines Fitting all data using SCMLAs can be readily carried out. However, ensuring stability and repeatability for extrapolation demands thorough analysis. The guidelines for stability analysis have been comprehensively documented in Ref. [20], where the main principles are as follows: (1). Reanalyze the data with 50% of the longest creep rupture time data removed (PAT 3.1). (2). Reanalyze the data with 10% of the lowest stress dataset at each temperature removed (PAT 3.2). (3). Extrapolate the creep rupture time to longer times using the network obtained from fitting short-time data. Compare the extrapolation results at longer times to the available experimental data. The predicted results from the above analysis should exhibit only marginal differences compared to the original analysis (unculled ones) [40]. It has been shown that the ECCC PATs can be satisfied automatically with constrained TTP and machine learning algorithms in many cases [19,20,22,41]. Moreover, extrapolations from short to long times have exhibited good agreement with the unculled results [19,20]. Furthermore, alongside the stability analysis proposed in Ref. [20], new guidelines for temperature culling and extrapolation have been introduced in this work, aiming to enhance the reliability of the model for creep rupture life extrapolation. This guideline is outlined as follows: A. Utilize SCMLAs to fit experimental data through culling of specific temperatures. Temperature culling involves eliminating temperatures within the experimental range, while temperature extrapolation involves removing the highest temperatures within the experimental range. This process generates a network. B. Employ the network created in step A, which is now held constant (frozen), to predict creep rupture life at the target temperature. Document and preserve these predicted results for further analysis. C. Subsequently, conduct a thorough comparison between all available experimental creep rupture data and the predicted results generated in step B. 2.3 Solution requirements In contrast to relying solely on the regression coefficient, mean squared error or cross-validation loss, stringent and systematic criteria have been imposed on the final solutions of the predicted results [20], as outlined below. (1). Apart from the constraints in eq. (1), the solutions should satisfy the requirements of stability analysis, including PAT 3.1 long time culled, PAT 3.2 low stress culled, extrapolation from short to long times, and prediction at specific temperatures. The errors between the unculled data and the culled data should remain under 10% [20,22]. (2). To assess the reliability of the extrapolation procedure, an extrapolation is performed based on culled data of t max/3 to t max, where t max is the maximum experimental rupture time. The predicted rupture stresses close to t max should not deviate significantly from the experimental data points. (3). The consistency of the methods is assessed with the relative deviation (RD) of the solutions, average relative standard deviation (ARSD), and self-consistency index for each algorithm. The RD, ARSD, and self-consistency index are defined below. (2) RD i j = \u03c3 i j \u2212 \u03c3 j \u203e \u03c3 j \u203e (3) SD j = \u2211 i = 1 n \u03c3 i j \u2212 \u03c3 j \u203e 2 n \u2212 1 ; RSD j = S D j \u03c3 j \u203e \u00d7 100 % ; ARSD = \u2211 j = 1 n j R S D j n j ; where i is the ith solution, e.g., i = 1-n, where n is the number of solutions. j is the jth temperature. n j is the number of temperatures. \u03c3 i j is the predicted stress at a given temperature j for each solution i. \u03c3 j \u203e is the average predicted stress at a specific temperature j averaged over the solutions i. SD j is the standard deviation at the temperature j averaged over the solutions, RSD j is the relative standard deviation at temperature j. ARSD is the relative standard deviation also averaged over the temperatures. The self-consistency index for each algorithm can be taken as 1-ARSD. It should be stated that the ARSD and self-consistency index introduced here primarily serve as tools for evaluating the consistency of the machine learning algorithms, given that distinct solutions may arise during the training process. The prediction errors, calculated as log(predicted rupture time/experimental rupture time), along with their distribution have been comprehensively addressed in a previous paper [21] and will not be reiterated here. A schematic representation of the evaluation process for SCMLAs is depicted in Fig. 1 . 2.4 Experimental information Experimental creep rupture data of austenitic and martensitic stainless steels were used in this work to validate the proposed models. The experimental information is listed below. (1). Austenitic stainless steels 316H, including tubes and plates with 10 different casts [42,43]; and austenitic 18Cr10Ni3CuNbN stainless steel Super304H with four different casts [44,45]. (2). Advanced tempered martensitic high Cr ferritic stainless steels 9Cr1MoVNb, TP91 (including tubes, plates, and pipes), with 11 casts [46], and 9Cr0.5Mo1.8WVNbB, TP92 (where T indicates tubes and P pipes), with 4 different casts [47]. 3 Results 3.1 Fitting and extrapolation Creep rupture life prediction for austenitic stainless steels, high Cr steels, and Ni-based alloys has been successfully performed through the utilization of the five soft-constrained machine learning algorithms (SCMLAs), resulting in satisfactory outcomes. An illustrative example is demonstrated for the austenitic stainless steel TP316H using SC LBFGSNNMR, as shown in Fig. 2 . Considering the substantial scatter within the experimental data of TP316H [42,43], the data that results in pronounced scatter at low stress levels at each temperature were excluded from the training process and reserved as validation data for the models. The training and optimization parameters can be found in Table 1. The prediction curves are compared to all the experimental data (including the large scatters), where a reasonable fit can be obtained, as depicted in Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b) illustrates extrapolation from t max/3 to t max, where t max is the longest experimental creep rupture time. This extrapolation analysis hinged on generating a model using experimental creep rupture data below t max/3, which was then employed to extrapolate outcomes at extended times. These extrapolated results were subsequently compared to experiments at longer times. Notably, compared with Fig. 2a) of fitting all experiments, the extrapolated results in Fig. 2b) exhibit a reasonable prediction with an extrapolation factor of over 3 in time. During extrapolation from short to long times, the experimental data at longer times (creep rupture time larger than t max/3) were unseen to the training and fitting process of SCMLAs. The first and second derivatives of the prediction curves that satisfy the criteria in eq. (1) with creep rupture time up to 300,000 h are shown in Fig. 2c) and d). It is essential that the first and second derivatives should satisfy the requirements of eq. (1) not only for creep rupture data beneath t max/3, but also at extended times up to 300,000 h. Fig. 2e) effectively demonstrates the absence of bending back or cross-overs for the predicted results over an extended time of 1,000,000 h, with temperatures ranging from 575 to 775 \u00b0C with 25 \u00b0C intervals, according to PAT 1.2 of ECCC [40,48]. PAT 2.1, which pertains to the biases of the predicted results, has been well documented in Ref. [21] and is not repeated here. The stability analysis of TP316H using SC LBFGSNNMR is depicted in Fig. 2f), encompassing PAT 3.1 long time culled, PAT 3.2 low stress culled, and extrapolation from short to long times. The errors between culled and unculled ones are reasonable and smaller than 10% recommended by ECCC [40]. To ascertain the final predicted values of the studied materials, a comparative evaluation of the five SCMLAs is necessary. In Fig. 3 a), a comparison of four SCMLAs for the creep rupture prediction of TP316H is presented. At extended times, such as 300,000 h, the average values obtained from these four algorithms can serve as the final predicted stresses. Notably, SC SVMR has been omitted from Fig. 3a), due to its substantial deviations observed during extrapolation from t max/3 to t max, as indicated in Fig. 3b). Similarly, for Super304H, the average values derived from the three SCMLAs presented in Fig. 3c) can be regarded as the final predicted values for extended times, such as 3t max. SC BRNN and SC SVMR failed in extrapolating from t max/3 to t max for Super304H, as illustrated in Fig. 3d). Remarkably, it has been demonstrated that the average value of all five algorithms can be adopted as the final predicted values for Sanicro 25, considering their minimal significant differences [20]. The quantitative determination of the final creep rupture prediction is based on evaluating the capability of the five SCMLAs for extrapolation from short to long times. These results demonstrate that the methods are reliable for fitting and extrapolating creep rupture life. It is worth noting that all methods do not automatically generate satisfactory results. The applicability of each method must be verified, for example, with the help of the culling analysis in Fig. 2f) and Fig. 3b) and d). Fig. 4 presents a comparison of creep rupture fitting and extrapolation for high Cr steels TP91 and TP92. Extrapolation from t max/3 to t max was carried out following the guidelines outlined in sections 2.2 and 2.3. The results clearly demonstrate a strong agreement between extrapolation from t max/3 to t max and fitting of all data, as depicted in Fig. 4a) for TP92 steels. This consistency underscores the stability and reliability of the methods for extrapolation. For TP91, as shown in Fig. 4b), the relative deviations between fitting all data and extrapolation from t max/3 to t max, are generally within 10% at the maximum creep rupture time for each temperature, except for the case of 650 \u00b0C. The relative deviations, expressed as \u03c3 extrap/\u03c3 fit, involve comparing the predicted stresses at the maximum creep rupture time, where \u03c3 extrap and \u03c3 fit represent the predicted stresses obtained through extrapolation from t max/3 to t max and fitting all data, respectively. At 650 \u00b0C, the relative deviation is approximately 11%, and it tends to increase with increasing creep rupture time, which is due to the sharp decline of the experimental data at longer times, which the model cannot cover fully. 3.2 Temperature culling and extrapolation Incorporating the reanalysis of PAT 3 group and the extrapolation from short to long times, this study introduces the novel guideline for temperature culling and extrapolation, as elaborated in section 2.2. This facet gains prominence due to its significance in various engineering applications, particularly the extrapolation to higher temperatures. Fig. 5 illustrates one example for predicting creep properties through temperature culling at 575 \u00b0C and 625 \u00b0C for TP91 high Cr steels, encompassing tubes, plates, and pipes across 11 different casts. The SC LMNN method was employed to fit the experimental data excluding experimental data at 575 \u00b0C and 625 \u00b0C, and the obtained prediction curves were then compared to the experiments at those specific temperatures, where a good agreement can be obtained, as depicted in Fig. 5a). Furthermore, the predicted results based on fitting all data and those excluding experiments at 575 \u00b0C and 625 \u00b0C were compared in Fig. 5b). It can be readily seen that there are negligible differences between fitting all data and prediction through temperature culling, and both can agree well with the experiments. Notably, comparable results were obtained with the other methods, but they are not presented here. Fig. 6 provides an illustrative example of temperature extrapolation at 700 \u00b0C for an advanced tempered martensitic high Cr ferritic stainless steel TP92 using SC BRNN. First, a network was established employing SC BRNN by utilizing all the experimental creep rupture data, excluding those exceeding 1000 h at 700 \u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 6a), which is referred to as extrapolation with t R < 1000 h at 700 \u00b0C (t R represents creep rupture time). Subsequently, the predicted results from Fig. 6a) were compared to various datasets, including all experimental data and fitting of all data (unculled), as demonstrated in Fig. 6b). It is evident that there exist only minor differences between unculled ones and extrapolation with t R < 1000 h at 700 \u00b0C, suggesting that it is stable and reliable for temperature extrapolation using SCMLAs. To eliminate the restriction imposed by the threshold value of 1000 h at 700 \u00b0C, which is commonly available for many materials, an additional dataset is introduced in Fig. 6b) as indicated by the dashed line. This dashed line corresponds to the prediction curve obtained by culling all experimental data at 700 \u00b0C, referred to as extrapolation with 700 \u00b0C culled. The errors exhibited a slight increase compared to the culling of t R > 1000 h at 700 \u00b0C, especially at longer times; however, these errors (\u03c3 extrap/\u03c3 fit, with \u03c3 extrap and \u03c3 fit denoting the predicted stresses obtained through extrapolation with 700 \u00b0C culled and fitting all data) remain within 10% compared to the unculled ones, affirming the reliability of temperature extrapolation at the highest temperatures. Regarding the extrapolation with 700 \u00b0C culled, the omission of prediction curves at other temperatures is due to the near absence of discrepancies when compared to the unculled results. The first and second derivatives that satisfy the requirements of eq. (1), including at 700 \u00b0C, are not repeated here. Besides 700 \u00b0C, it is also possible to generate the prediction results at other temperatures, such as 650 or 725 \u00b0C for TP92 steels. Comparable results can be obtained using other methods for a number of materials; TP92 serves as an illustrative example within this context. 3.3 Effects of single casts The significant scattering observed in the experimental data in the preceding figures primarily results from variations between different casts. Thus, the effects of single casts will be further analyzed in this section. It is important to note that unless otherwise specified, the results discussed in this paper pertain to all casts. For specific analyses of single casts, they will be explicitly designated. Fig. 7 presents the results depicting the effects of single casts on the studied materials using SC LMNN. In Fig. 7a), a comparison is made between predictions based on all casts and those based on single cast MGC for TP91 steels. It is apparent that the single cast MGC can effectively represent the mean predictions of all casts, with only minor deviations between them. Nevertheless, it is evident that at lower stress levels and longer time regions, particularly at 600\u2013650 \u00b0C, the predictions exhibit more pronounced deviations. This divergence may be attributed to substantial alterations in the failure mechanisms; however, the model does not fully account for these changes. Moving to Fig. 7b), predictions based on all casts are compared with those based on single casts of MJP and MJU for TP92 steels. For MJP, the predictions closely align with experiments, and show only slight deviations from the predictions of all casts. However, in the case of MJU, the predictions agree well with experiments but exhibit substantial deviations from the predictions of all casts and MJP. The deviations may be attributed to the quality of the MJU data. The creep rupture times of MJU fall within the range of 527\u201320992 h, which is significantly lower than for other casts (with a maximum of 118,649 h). Additionally, the shorter time range of 10\u2013500 h is absent in MJU compared to other casts. These observations raise concerns about the suitability of the MJU data for extrapolation using SCMLAs. Alternatively, the extrapolation results of MJU demonstrate a similar trend to those generated by Maruyama et al. [10], who employed the multiregion analysis and observed a transition within the median-term range. Furthermore, they suggested that the notable deviations from MJP can be attributed to differences in prior austenite grain size. Fig. 7c) exhibits an analysis focused on single casts of AAF and AAL for TP316H. It is evident that AAL and AAF represent the upper and lower bands of the creep rupture data, respectively. The predictions agree with experiments but deviate significantly from the mean predictions based on all casts. This indicates that these single casts exhibit significantly different behavior compared to other casts. The results demonstrate that analysis of single casts should be carried out, particularly those that exhibit significant deviations. However, it is worth noting that the quality of AAF data may not be suitable for extrapolation using SCMLAs, despite reasonable agreement being obtained. On the other hand, to study the general behavior of TP316H, five casts with minimal deviations between them, namely AAA, AAB, AAC, AAM, and AAN (referred to as ABCMN in this paper), were analyzed and presented in Fig. 7d). A comparison of fitting all data and extrapolation from t max/3 to t max, for casts ABCMN, reveals strong agreement, suggesting that it is feasible to fit and extrapolate the creep rupture life of TP316H by combining data from several casts. In conclusion, SCMLAs can be successfully applied for analysis of single casts, such as MGC of TP91, MJP of TP92, five similar casts of TP316H, the single cast of Sanicro 25 [20], and four similar casts of Super304H. However, it is not advisable to use the methods for single casts with lower quality data. Fig. 8 illustrates the temperature dependence of creep rupture predictions, i.e., log(t R) vs. 1/T K. The comparison involves regression fits, SCMLAs predictions, and experimental data for single casts. In Fig. 8a), the results for a single cast MGC of TP91 steels are examined. The regression lines tend to overestimate the creep rupture life at 80 MPa, while the SC LMNN predictions gives a better representation at stress levels of 100 MPa and 140 MPa. The regression lines depicted in the figures were obtained through ordinary least squares regression, employing the experimental data for log(t R) and 1/T K. As suggested by Maruyama et al. [10], the regression fits or common TTPs often overestimate the creep rupture life at longer times due to the expected transition in deformation and rupture mechanisms, which is related to the changes in the activation energy. Multiregion analysis for TP91 shows evident transitions [8,9], whereas the SCMLAs in this study consistently show minor smooth transitions, indicating that the model accounts for the changes in rupture mechanisms to a limited extent. Similar minor transitions are observed for a single cast AAL of TP316H, as depicted in Fig. 8b). In the case of AAL, the regression fits represent the experimental data, suggesting no significant changes in activation energy under the presented experimental conditions. It is evident from Fig. 8 that the changes in activation energy with temperature are larger for TP91 than for TP316H. 3.4 Fitting and self-consistency error estimates Fig. 9 presents a comprehensive overview of error estimates for SCMLAs applied to various materials. In addition to the regression coefficient and error histogram which are basic requirements of common machine learning algorithms, the relative deviation in solutions and self-consistency of algorithms have been employed, as outlined in section 2.3. Fig. 9a) and b) display the regression coefficient and error histogram of fitting analysis for TP92 using SC BRNN and TP91 using SC LMNN, respectively. The regression coefficient stands at approximately 98% for all fitting computations and around 96% for all extrapolation analyses, including the unphysical results derived from common machine learning algorithms, indicating that the high regression coefficient alone cannot serve as a reliable indicator for reasonable fitting analysis. Additionally, the error histogram demonstrates a normal distribution with reasonably small errors; similar outcomes were observed across various algorithms and materials. Turning to Fig. 9c) and d), these figures illustrate the relative deviation histogram (RDH) of fitting solutions for Super304H using SC SVMR and extrapolation at 700 \u00b0C for TP92 using SC BRNN, respectively. The relative deviations obtained according to eq. (2) are reasonably small (within \u00b11%) and exhibit an approximately normal distribution, indicating that the methods can generate consistent results for creep rupture prediction. Comparable patterns were noted for other cases, although they are not depicted in the figure. The fitting accuracy and self-consistency index of the algorithms, expressed as 1-ARSD, where ARSD is the average relative standard deviation of the predicted results at different temperatures, c.f. eq. (3), is depicted in Fig. 9e) and f) for TP316H and Super304H, respectively. The self-consistency index of SCMLAs across various stability analyses (including fitting of all data, PAT 3.1, PAT 3.2, and extrapolation from short to long times) exceeds 97.5% for TP316H at 300,000 h and for Super304H at 3t max, indicating that the methods can generate consistent results across different analyses. Comparable findings were observed for other materials. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods, yielding reliable and consistent outcomes. All the presented methods exhibit low fitting errors. The methods are also self-consistent, i.e., they are stable against culling of some of the data. This does not mean that the methods automatically generate accurate extrapolation results, as demonstrated in section 3.1. Specifically, SC SVMR for TP316H, as well as SC BRNN and SC SVMR for Super304H deviated from the experimental data close to t max in the test of extrapolation from t max/3 to t max and had to be excluded from the extrapolation. This demonstrates that careful analysis must always be made for the extrapolation results to ensure that they are consistent with the experimental data. 4 Discussion 4.1 Influential factors It has been exemplified by Sanicro 25 [20] that arbitrary and unphysical results can be generated using the common machine learning algorithms without the constraints in eq. (1). This observation extends to the present study with TP316H and Super304H, depicted in Fig. 10 , where evident occurrences of bending backs, crossovers, and flexing of prediction curves emerge. Similar patterns are observed across other cases, though not explicitly shown. As stated in section 3.4, comparably high regression coefficients (98%) can be obtained for constrained and unconstrained methods. However, it has come to light that focusing solely on low errors and high regression coefficients cannot ensure the physical validity of fitting and extrapolation results across all studied materials, including Sanicro 25 [20]. Notably, while BRNN has been suggested to have a better capability of avoiding overfitting and enhancing generalization performance [16,34,36,38,49], it is evident in the context of creep, that it can generate unphysical results without the constraints. The testing and comparisons reveal that variations in hidden neurons, loss functions, and evaluation numbers do not significantly affect the final predictions. This aligns with the findings for Sanicro 25 [20]. The dominant factor lies in the soft-constrained derivatives, which play a crucial role in ensuring rational outcomes. Consequently, common machine learning algorithms without constraints are inadequate for accurately fitting and extrapolating creep rupture properties. In the context of temperature extrapolation, a threshold of 1000 h at 700 \u00b0C has been selected, a value readily available across various materials. As demonstrated in Fig. 6b), employing creep rupture times below 1000 h at 700 \u00b0C has facilitated improved accuracy compared to culling all experiments at this temperature. This finding implies that reliable temperature extrapolation by soft-constrained machine learning algorithms (SCMLAs) using short-term data (e.g., 1000 h) can be obtained. TP316H was selected for this study due to its data distribution being representative of many austenitic stainless steels, such as TP347H and TP321H. For most creep rupture curves, the constraints in eq. (1) can be used. To date, SCMLAs have been successfully applied to various materials, including austenitic stainless steels like Sanicro 25 [20], TP316H, TP321H, NCF800H (32Cr21NiMnSi), Super304H, advanced martensitic high Cr ferritic stainless steels such as TP91, TP92, SUH616B (12Cr1Mo1W0.3V), and Ni-based superalloys like Ni\u201313Cr4.5MoTi6Al, where similar outcomes were obtained. 4.2 Methods comparison A hard-constrained neural network (NN) has been proposed by He and Sandstr\u00f6m [19], where new algorithms have been developed from scratch by encoding the constraints in eq. (1) into the NN frameworks. The physics-constrained NN (PCNN) and hard-constrained NN usually require complex encoding of the physical constraints into the new algorithms. Allthese methods provide alternative approaches for analyzing the properties of materials. Moreover, a constrained TTP (Time-Temperature Parameter) method has been proposed for creep rupture analysis of austenitic stainless steels [22]. Compared with the hard-constrained NN and the constrained TTP methods, SCMLAs exhibit analogous behavior in terms of fitting and extrapolation. In this study, SCMLAs have been extended to various austenitic and martensitic stainless steels, where the obtained results can be applied to high-temperature alloys. The SCMLAs also present an alternative approach for creep rupture assessment. It has been demonstrated that SCMLAs could be applied to predict the remaining creep life of high-temperature steels and alloys. Such an approach has been proposed by He and Sandstr\u00f6m [21], involving the fitting of prediction error distributions using log-logistic distribution functions, where the probability of premature creep failure can be evaluated quantitatively using the position of outliers. There are creep rupture curves where the second derivative is not consistently negative. The first derivative is always negative. In particular, this is the case for so-called sigmoidal curves, which can be due to extensive precipitation reactions. However, such situations are difficult to handle with statistical methods such as NN or TTPs anyway because the temperature and time dependence of the precipitation reaction must be identical to that of the rupture process, which is rarely the case. Cases with complex metallurgical reactions should instead be treated with fundamental models. Such models have successfully been developed by the authors [1\u20136]. Thus, the assumption about negative derivatives implies little restriction to statistical methods. In the fundamental models, the evolution of microstructures and defects, such as dislocation hardening, precipitation hardening, solid solution hardening, stacking faults contribution, and creep cavitation along grain boundaries, are considered. The employment of fundamental models offers valuable insights into the mechanisms governing creep rupture, granting a more reliable prediction for longer times. However, their intricate nature has restrained their widespread adoption, impeding their broader usage. In the end, it is crucial to recognize the limitations of the SCMLAs and other statistical methods like TTPs. These methods are inherently data-driven; it is worth noting that extrapolating by a factor exceeding 3 in time following the ECCC suggestions is not recommended. The methods have been applied to single casts of materials; however, it is not recommended to utilize the methods for single casts with low-quality data. Data quality hinges on the distribution and size of the dataset, without strict criteria. High-quality data is characterized by well-distributed experimental data within fine time and stress intervals, as exemplified by MJP of TP92 in this study. Conversely, low-quality data emerges from a small dataset size or gaps in data distribution within fine stress or time intervals, resulting in substantial prediction uncertainties, such as MJU of TP92 in this study. For further illustration, in case of low-quality data, extrapolating from 30,000 h to 100,000 h becomes problematic when experimental data in the range of 10,000\u201330000 h is absent, leading to an extrapolation ratio of 10 instead of 3, rendering extrapolation unfeasible. 5 Conclusions \u2022 New guidelines for temperature culling, involving the removal of specific temperatures within the input experimental range, and temperature extrapolation beyond the input experimental range have been introduced in this study. The implementation of these guidelines yields significant agreement between experimental and predicted results, facilitating effective temperature culling and extrapolation. \u2022 Soft-constrained machine learning algorithms (SCMLAs) have been successfully applied to various austenitic and martensitic stainless steels. The methods are associated with low fitting errors, and they are self-consistent, i.e., they are stable after culling some of the long-term data. To obtain accurate extrapolation results, the predicted rupture values should also be verified against the test of extrapolation from t max/3 to t max. \u2022 Comprehensive evaluations have been conducted for SCMLAs, covering constrained derivatives, fitting of all data, extrapolation from short to long times, temperature extrapolation, temperature culling, culling of long-time and low-stress data, as well as error estimate using relative deviation and self-consistency. The methods that fulfil all the requirements can predict creep rupture with consistent accuracy when extrapolated to 300,000 h or three times the longest experimental creep rupture time for all investigated materials. \u2022 SCMLAs can be effectively applied to single casts of materials with high-quality data, but it is discouraged to employ the models for single casts with lower quality data. \u2022 The temperature-dependent creep rupture life predictions reveal that SCMLAs partially account for the transitions in fracture mechanisms. \u2022 These findings suggest that SCMLAs offer an alternative avenue for assessing creep rupture life.

Ecological carrying capacity is key to evaluating sustainable development capacity, and land use change has varying degrees of impact on ecosystems. This study explores the ecological carrying capacity based on land use change, which is important for the conservation and scientific and rational use of ecosystems. Therefore, in this study, three machine learning classification 3algorithms, namely support vector machine, random forest and artificial neural network, were selected for accuracy comparison and analysis based on multi-source data, using Southwest Guangxi Karst-Beibu Gulf as the study area. The Patch-generating Land Use Simulation Model is used to dissect the spatial and temporal changes in ecological carrying capaciyt from 1990 to 2040 and future trends. The results showed that (1) Coupling multiple sources of data and machine learning classification algorithms can ultimately improve land use classification accuracy. The RF is compared and found to be the optimal classification algorithm for this study. (2) The area of arable and grassland gradually decreases between 1990 and 2040, mainly encroached upon by build land; the area of forested land gradually recovers, the watershed fluctuates up and down, and the area of build land gradually increases. (3) The ecological carrying capacity from 1990 to 2040 shows a trend of decreasing and then increasing, and the area of low and medium\u2013low decreases from 2020 to 2040, with arable land and forest land having a stronger potential to increase ecological carrying capacity. Nanning City, Qinzhou City and Chongzuo City are severely damaged. The framework provides an effective tool for exploring future ecological carrying capacity to support the ecological conservation and future sustainable development of the region.

Land is the carrier of terrestrial ecosystems and the basis for human survival and development, and land use change is closely linked to human activities and the structure of terrestrial ecosystems. (McBain et al., 2017). Since China's reform and opening up, economic development has neglected ecological protection, and the development of many regions has exceeded the ECC of the region, making the development model unsustainable (Qiu et al., 2021). Therefore, it is necessary to explore the ECC based on land use change, which is important for improving ecosystems and sustainable development. In the early 20th century, some scholars had already started land-related research, focusing on land registration, land classification and mapping (Chen., 1996; Anderson et al., 1976). During the 1950s and 1980s, space technology continued to develop and land use classification based on remote sensing data gradually began to become mainstream. Beginning in the 1990s, research on land use in China began to move from its beginnings to a flourishing development. Currently, high precision long time series intelligent extraction and future prediction of land information is already a global hotspot and frontier (Zhang et al., 2023; Benjamin et al., 2013; Kline, 2004; Wang et al., 2022). With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, land use classification methods are gradually changing from the traditional visual interpretation to remote sensing intelligent classification algorithms (Shukla et al., 2018). Among the intelligent classification algorithms for land use, the widely used and representative algorithms are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neutral Network (ANN). The RF is an ensemble algorithm composed of different decision trees that can handle high-dimensional data, fast training, and simple implementation. However, classification noise can appear to be overfitting, which will affect classification accuracy (Zhang et al., 2016). The SVM model solves the problem of data classification by solving the optimization problem and finds the optimal classification hyperplane in the high-dimensional feature space. Its small sample training supports high-dimensional feature space. However, for large-scale training samples and multicategory classification problems, corresponding improvements need to be made (Li et al., 2009). The ANN simulate biological neural structures for classifying and storing data. They are simple to operate, do not require complex mathematical models and have a high learning capacity, but are not subject to human control, have slow learning times and take a long time to train (Gu et al., 2019). Nowadays, single data sources and classification methods in complex ecosystems are not sufficient to meet research needs. How to efficiently use multiple sources of data to quickly extract land surface information and realise high precision comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms is still in the development stage. Therefore, we realize the extraction and accuracy comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms for land use, with a view to providing technical support for the screening and formulation of optimal algorithms for intelligent land use information extraction. Land use includes both quantitative and spatial aspects in its projections. Currently, the more commonly used models are Markov, Grey Model (GM(1,1)) and Logistic models (Zhang et al., 2021). The Cellular Automaton (CA) has a unique advantage in geotemporal simulation, with powerful spatio-temporal coupling characteristics and spatial computing power, which can realize the simulation of complex systems by analyzing the way of spatio-temporal location transformation. Therefore, there are many models combined with CA models for comprehensive use, such as CA-Markov, CA-ANN and CA-logistic are more widely used. Today, there are new land use models such as the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model and the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model (Qiu et al., 2021). The FLUS model is derived from CA and improves on the traditional basis by combining ANN algorithms to extract conversion probabilities for various land types. It is an adaptive competition mechanism through roulette wheel selection that increases the accuracy of the simulation significantly, but the method is quantitatively under-predictive, requires coupling to other models, and lacks conceptual and mechanistic mining of land use drivers (Liu et al., 2017). The PLUS model is constructed by RF and CA. It addresses the shortcomings of traditional CA models in two areas, namely transformation rule mining and patch dynamic change simulation. The model proposes a site sprawl analysis strategy, and a CA model with multiple types of random patch seeding mechanisms with better interpretation (Liang et al, 2021). The ECC was introduced by Park in 1921. It is defined as the maximum size at which a certain organism can survive in a certain environment and reflects the ecological supply capacity (Park, 1921). In terms of research content, it includes the ECC of tourism, the ECC of agriculture, forestry and fisheries (Hu et al., 2020; Wu, 2019). In the environmental assessment method, it include the ecological footprint method, the three-dimensional ecological footprint model, and the life cycle assessment method (Zhou, 2019; Yang et al., 2020). In terms of areas of study, it includes countries, urban agglomerations, watersheds and administrative regions across the globe. A large number of scholars have focused their research on the ECC on administrative units or watersheds (Li et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Due to the effectiveness of statistical data updating and the variability, there is a deficiency in revealing the spatial pattern of the ECC, and relatively few studies have been conducted at the raster scale(Shan et al., 2012). The ecological footprint method is one of the most common methods used by experts and scholars to study the ECC. It is a mature method, highly operational. However, in the calculation of important parameters, it mostly refers to \u201cglobal hectares\u201d or \u201cnational hectares\u201d. However, it is worth noting that there are problems such as large scale variability and poor targeting, and the final calculation results are inaccurate (Shan et al., 2012). Therefore, this study makes reference to the previous achievements and optimises two shortcomings of the current situation. Firstly, This study calculates the ECC index based on the land use raster scale, with a view to quantifying and spatially expressing the ECC of the region and realising the spatial pattern analysis of the regional the ECC. Secondly, this study has improved the ecological footprint model by using \u201cprovincial hectares\u201d instead of the traditional \u201cglobal/national hectares\u201d. This study aims to improve the accuracy of the calculation of the ecological carrying capacity index and provide a scientific basis for analysing the ECC of the region. The Southwest Guangxi Karst-Beibu Gulf is an integrated transition zone spanning the mountain-river-sea-edge. It has the fragility of karst mountains, the complexity of multiple watersheds and the interaction of coastal zones. Its ecosystems are integrated, diverse and complex. The frequent occurrence of cloudy and rainy weather in the region makes it difficult to acquire and process high-quality remote sensing images, and poses many technical problems for long time series monitoring and prediction of the ecological environment. In the context of China's new era, the region is a new strategic pivot point for the open development of the southwest central and southern regions, a new land and sea corridor in the west and a newly promoted free trade zone, and the heart of the Beibu Gulf City Cluster, the Pan Delta City Circle and the China-ASEAN City Cluster. It is located at the south-western border being pushed to the forefront of China's opening up to the outside world and has been given a rare and historic opportunity. Therefore, how to scientifically carry out monitoring and assessment management of complex ecosystem data to provide data support and theoretical basis for the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems and provide scientific reference for regional ecosystem management. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Research content This study proposes a model framework that integrates machine learning, improves ecological footprint and PLUS model. The study investigates past and future spatial and temporal changes in land use and ECC. Details of the study are given below. (1) In this study, Landsat remote sensing images were used as the base data, combined with multiple sources of data such as topography and climate. Three machine learning classification algorithms, namely SVM, RF and ANN, were selected for accuracy comparison and analysis, and the classification algorithm with the highest accuracy was selected as the classification algorithm for this study. (2) This study examines the spatial and temporal changes and spatial shifts in land use over the past 30 years, and analyses the spatial and temporal trends in ECC, in conjunction with an improved ecological footprint methodology. (3) The PLUS model constructed based on coupled RF and CA predicts the ECC pattern in 2030 and 2040 and analyses the future change trend. The changes in ECC of each land use type from 1990 to 2040 were explored. 2.2 Study area The Southwest Guangxi Karst-Beibu Gulf (E104\u00b028\u2032\u223c109\u00b056\u2032, N20\u00b026\u2032\u223c25\u00b007\u2032), consisting of the Southwest Guizhou Karst Region and the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone, contains seven cities and 55 counties, it has a total area of 108,365.41 km2 (Fig. 1 ). The topography of the region gradually decreases from north-west to south-east as a whole, with a top-down slope along the foothills of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the coastline of Beibu Gulf. It has a subtropical monsoon climate with hot and rainy summers, mild and less rainy winters and abundant heat, with distinct dry and rainy seasons. Temperatures in the study area range from 2.8 to 40.4 \u00b0C, with precipitation ranging from 1745.6 to 3111.9 mm. The area is rich in rainfall and water resources, and sometimes extreme weather can occur. The northwestern part of the study area is a karst mountainous region with serious stone desertification, poor soil, prone to drought, not easy to cultivate, and serious soil erosion. The coastal area of the northern bay is densely populated by humans, with unreasonable development of coastal zone resources such as sea enclosures and scenic development, and aquaculture destroying marine resources. The region's forest, wetland and grassland resources are all declining from 1990 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the total population of the region reaches 26.43 million people and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reaches 1,212.783 billion yuan. 2.3 Data source and data pre-processing The remote sensing image data are Landsat series images from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) with a spatial resolution of 30 \u00d7 30 m and a temporal resolution of 16 d. This study perform radiometric correction, mosaic and crop fusion pre-processing of the image classification. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were obtained from the National Center for Basic Geographic Information (Qiu et al., 2021). The obtained data were extracted from the DEM using GIS spatial analysis for 30 \u00d7 30 m in the study area, and pre-processed by unified projection (Albers projection coordinate system, datum D Krasovsky 1940), cropping and reclassification. Through spatial analysis tools, slope and slope direction were calculated for the analysis of the driving mechanism and the restricted area setting for simulation prediction. The meteorological data in this study include mean annual precipitation and mean annual air temperature. This study spatially interpolated the acquired data using the inverse distance weighting method to produce a dataset of the spatial distribution of mean temperature and mean annual precipitation at a spatial resolution 30 \u00d7 30 m for each year. The underlying geographic information data includes highways, railways and settlements. This study modified the data by means of Google Earth data validation vectors (Dai et al., 2020). The data were mainly used to drive the mechanism detection and simulation prediction of the restricted area setting, and the highway distance, railway distance and settlement centre distance were calculated by the Euclidean distance method to obtain a spatial distribution layer with a spatial resolution 30 \u00d7 30 m. 2.4 Research methods 2.4.1 Training sample and test sample selection After analysing the general situation of the study area, this study used Google Earth and existing land use data products, with the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Differential Build Index (NDBI) and DEM as the most auxiliary data (Dai et al., 2020). According to the principle of uniform distribution of samples, manual visual interpretation was used to select cultivated land, forest, grassland, water and build land in order based on a priori knowledge and spectral features of the features. This study built a training sample set and a test sample set according to the ratio of 7:3. This study repeatedly experimented according to the algorithm results and adjusted the inconsistent results repeatedly until the classification results reached a high accuracy. The training samples and test samples for each land class are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 . 2.4.2 Random forest RF is an integrated learning algorithm that is more accurate than a single classifier. The principle is to randomly select training samples and feature parameters for decision tree classification, and the final result is obtained by integrated decision tree voting (Breiman, 2001). (1) y = Y max \u2211 t \u2208 F f x , t = y Where, F is the random forest expression F={f1, f2,\u2026, fn }, I is the indicative function, which takes the value of 0 or 1. A value of 1 indicates that the function holds and the classification target with the highest number of votes is the final type. 2.4.3 ECC calculation - improved ecological footprint model Ecological footprint models are widely used in ECC research, and have the advantages of intuition, simple operation and high feasibility. At present, the calculation of ecological footprint in China is unified in national and global hectares (Shan et al., 2012), and there is no unified calculation method based on \u201cprovincial hectares\u201d, which will affect the reliability and relevance of the results. This study therefore uses the 'provincial hectare' as the unit of accounting. The statistical yearbook data was used to recalculate the provincial equilibrium and yield factors, which are decisive for the ECC calculation (Gu et al., 2019). Finally, the results of the provincial parameters were entered into the ecological footprint formula to calculate the ecological carrying capacity index, the formula is as follows: (2) Q = \u2211 i = 1 n A i \u00d7 p i \u00d7 r i Where Ai is the productive land area of category i, pi equilibrium factor, and ri is the yield factor. 2.4.3.1 Equilibrium factor The equilibrium factor, which characterizes the differences in the productive capacity of different land classes, can convert the per capita occupancy of different productive land classes into equilibrium area by the following formula. (3) p i = p i \u00af p \u00af = E i F i / \u2211 E i \u2211 F i Where pi is the equilibrium factor of productive land of class i, p i \u00af is the average productivity of land i, p \u00af is the productivity of all land, Ei is the total production of land of class i, and Fi is the productive area of land of class i. 2.4.3.2 Yield factor The yield factor is an expression of the difference in productive capacity between the same land class geographically, and due to the different natural and human factors, which leads to the different productivity of each land class in each year, the conversion of the yield factor is needed, as follows. (4) r i = p i j \u00af p \u00af i = E i j F i j / E i F i where ri is the yield factor of productive land of category i, p i j \u00af is the average productivity of land i, p \u00af i is the productivity of all land, E i j is the total output of land of category i in region j, F i j is the area of land of category i in region j, Ei is the total yield of land of category i, and Fi is the productive area of land of category i. 2.4.4 ECC prediction - PLUS model In this study, the PLUS model is used to simulate and predict the spatial and temporal patterns of ECC in the study area. Compared with other related models, the PLUS model can obtain higher simulation accuracy and more reasonable spatio-temporal patterns. The PLUS model consists of two modules, a framework for transformational rule mining based on land sprawl analysis strategies and a CA model based on a multi-type stochastic patch seeding mechanism. (1) Based on the overlay of ECC change data, the part of change between two periods of data is extracted, and then randomly selected sampling points are selected and trained separately to explore the relationship between the spatial change of ECC and the driving factors using the RF algorithm. The algorithm is able to handle high-dimensional data as well as the multicollinearity between variables, and finally output the probability of ECC change. (2) The PLUS model uses a multi-type random patch seeding mechanism based on a descending threshold, which is implemented through a process of calculating the overall probability. (3) In this study, Kappa coefficients and FOM coefficients are used for classification accuracy validation. Based on the confusion matrix Kappa coefficients have a very significant advantage for consistency testing. 3 Analysis of results 3.1 A comparative study of machine learning algorithms for land use in 2020 based on multi-source data 3.1.1 Overall classification accuracy comparison analysis The overall classification accuracy of the three intelligent classification algorithms is shown in Table 3 , and the overall classification results and local results are shown in Fig. 2 . This study compared the results of the three machine learning algorithms using only Landsat data involved in classification (A) and those using multiple sources of data involved in classification (B) separately and found that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were significantly higher using multiple sources of data involved in classification. The SVM has the least improvement in overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The study area is large in scale and the SVM algorithm has some spatial advantages for small sample training, which is more prominent for large-scale training samples and multi-category classification problems in this region. The ANN showed the greatest improvement in overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. As the ANN is not under human control and the Training Rate parameter is set to improve the classification speed of the algorithm, but reduces the accuracy of the classification and has the problem of more fragmented patches. The study area has a staggered distribution of land cover types, for which the heterogeneity of the image elements is large. The RF classification algorithm is prone to overfitting situations, which in turn affects its classification accuracy. The final classification accuracy results show that the RF algorithm has the highest overall accuracy (89.4%) and Kappa coefficient (0.88) for land use classification. Therefore, the RF algorithm coupled with multiple sources of data can obtain higher classification accuracy and at the same time have better classification efficiency. 3.2 Analysis of spatial and temporal land use patterns 1990\u20132020 The results show that the cultivated land is gradually decreasing in area from 1900 to 2020, mainly in Nanning and Yulin, with a relatively concentrated distribution in recent years. The area of forest land is on the rise, mainly in the northern part of Baise and Chongzuo. The forest has been the most widely distributed type of land use in the region and plays a vital role in the ecological environment of the region. The distribution of grassland in the area is relatively small and has been sporadic over the years. The water are the least regionally variable land type, with a relatively stable spatial distribution, especially for river and lake types, with no significant changes. There is a clear tendency for build land to expand, with Nanning, Yulin and Beihai expanding the most. When simulated the spatial distribution of GDP based on nighttime lighting, it was also the three cities mentioned above that had a higher rank, indicating a direct relationship between urban construction and the economy. However, it is important to consider the reasonableness and appropriateness of the expansion of Build land, which once again confirms the need to study the ECC and to always adhere to the concept of \u201cgreen water and green mountains are the silver mountain of gold\u201d (Fig. 3 ). To further grasp the study land use area, calculations were made to obtain Fig. 4 . The results found that overall, the largest area of forest land was found, accounting for about 65% of the study area, followed by arable land, accounting for about 25% of the study area, with the remaining 10% being grassland, water and build land, respectively, and the smallest area of water, accounting for about 2% of the study area. From 1990 to 2020 the area of cultivated land and grassland is on a downward trend, and the area of forest and build land is on an upward trend, with the expansion of build land encroaching on cultivated land and grassland. The area of water variation remains within 50 km2, which is somewhat related to the precipitation of the year. Although the area of forest and build land has increased year by year, the city has developed and the ecological environment has been improved. However, the decline in cultivated land and grassland should not be overlooked. If natural resources are used in an unreasonable manner and food security may not be guaranteed, then ecological risks will increase and there will be a risk of a decline in the ECC. The spatial transfer of land use from 1990 to 2020 is shown in Fig. 5 . The results show that there is less transfer out of build land, basically from forest and cultivated land to build land, mainly in Yulin and Nanning. These two cities are key construction areas in Guangxi and key areas in the national development strategy. The forest transfer is highly variable, and the forest transfer out of the terrain is mostly flat and hilly, closer to water sources, but also in the vicinity of cultivated land. The next step of ecological restoration and land improvement should focus on the forest, otherwise both forest restoration and biodiversity conservation will be at increased risk. The spatial transfer of water is relatively smooth. Many waters are surrounded by cultivated and build land. The cultivated land has been a priority for the government and relevant parts of the planning, and the cultivated land has been centrally regulated as productive land. These areas have flat terrain, complete water facilities and convenient transportation. The grassland is always scattered and randomly distributed, with a clear shifting distribution in the north and south-west of Baise. 3.3 Analysis of spatial and temporal changes in the ECC The ECC is calculated by improving the ecological footprint model, and the GIS spatial analysis is used to classify the ECC per unit area into 5 levels using the geometric breakpoint method, which are low (0\u20131.462), middle-low (1.463\u20132.776), middle (2.777\u20134.392), middle-high (4.393\u20136.454), high (6.455\u20138.176) finally obtained the ECC level map for 1990\u20132020 as shown in Fig. 6 . The ECC per unit area for the four periods 1990\u20132020 ranges from 0.884 to 8.176, with an average value of 4.531, which is a middle-high class overall. The trend of the ECC rises and then continues to fall, with a downward trend in the karst mountains, mainly in Baise and Chongzuo. The main categories are middle and middle-low. The basin and its surrounding areas are dominated by low, with the upper reaches having a greater impact on a number of rivers downstream. The Beibu Gulf coastal zone region, as a whole, shows a small downward trend. 3.4 Spatial and temporal patterns of the ECC forecast for 2020\u20132040 3.4.1 PLUS model simulation accuracy validation The simulation results take the real the ECC of the study area in 2020 as a comparison, and use Kappa coefficient and FOM coefficient to verify the accuracy. The spatial distribution of the ECC in 2010 was chosen as the input data, and the simulation results were compared with the real data in 2020, resulting in a Kappa coefficient value of 0.836. The consistency of our simulation accuracy results is good and the results are credible. The result of calculating FOM coefficient is 0.325, due to the resolution setting of 30 \u00d7 30 m and the large scope of the study area, the simulation accuracy cannot reach very high, the overall accuracy is high and the error value is small, which indicates that the simulation accuracy has reached the ideal effect. (Fig. 7 ). 3.4.2 Analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of the ECC prediction The results found that overall, the ECC per unit area in 2030 and 2040 ranged from 1.299 to 8.832, with a mean value of 5.06. The ECC as a whole is middle to high, showing a transitional trend of increasing carrying capacity from the southwest karst region to the southeast coast, with the watershed as a link. In comparison, the trend in the ECC of the study area over the two years is upwards, with the ECC of the watershed remaining low and the ECC of the cropland and woodland increasing and becoming more widely distributed. (Fig. 8 ). This study counted the area of each class and found that there is an increasing trend towards better the ECC in the study area. The area of low and middle-low are slowly decreasing and some of the middle-low is being converted to high. The middle accounts for a relatively small proportion of the study area. The middle-high is more variable and also has the widest distribution of the ECC classes in the region, with an increasing trend from 2010 to 2040. The high shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing, with small changes and a risk of degradation grade, and should be strengthened, with enhanced means of governance and improved governance systems. (Fig. 9 ). 3.5 Trends in the ECC of various land use types from 1990 to 2040 Different land use types have different ecosystem services and correspondingly different ECC, and it is necessary to explore the trends. The ECC of cultivated land is rising and then falling, and the arable area and yield factor are declining year by year. It is vital to pay attention to water and soil pollution to ensure food security. Forests are showing a continuous decline followed by an increase, and much of the degradation of forest land is caused by encroachment of cultivated land and build land, which should be brought to the attention of policy makers. Grasslands are in a downward trend and have been characterised in the study area as an unstable ecosystem with an irregular and fragmented distribution. The ECC of the waters is low, and the waters are mostly in the water interaction zone and sea-land interaction zone, with complex ecosystems and fragile ecological environments. 2010\u2032s low ECC spatial distribution is also mainly distributed in the coastal zone areas, which, together with the frequent occurrence of natural disasters in the coastal zone, has contributed to the reduction of ECC. The upward trend in the ECC of build land is closely linked to the ecological projects that have been continuously proposed in recent years and to the accelerated urbanisation process (Fig. 10 ). 4 Discussion 4.1 Research content aspects At present, global ecological problems and climate change are currently intensifying, and global climate change must have a non-negligible impact on the ECC of the region. This study combines the characteristics of the study area with the fact that climate change varies greatly from ecosystem to ecosystem and plays an important role in woodland restoration, watershed change and crop growth. In the future we need to actively explore how the ECC is driven in this respect and assess whether this will affect local ecological security (Deeksha et al., 2022). The local ecological situation needs to be assessed and analysed with reference to the international situation, for example in relation to the SDGs. The main reason for such strong changes is the conversion of large amounts of forest to dryland, which has increased food security but has had a greater impact on the forest ecosystem. The region is mountainous and the destruction of forests is prone to natural disasters such as soil erosion and landslides. Of course it cannot be overlooked that according to the first SDGs report submitted in 2019, many of the SDGs will not be achieved by 2020 and 2030 if UN member states continue to follow the current development model and such conclusions as mentioned above also apply to this region (Kavvada et al., 2020). Comparing similar studies, it is found that the RF algorithm is the highest accuracy in the comparative analysis of land use machine learning algorithms based on multi-source data, which is similar to and different from the results of some scholars (Gu, 2018; Dai, 2020), mainly because of the different scales selected for the study area, and the smaller training samples of the study sample area have obvious advantage, for other algorithms in general. In the analysis of land use change, arable land showed a decreasing trend and forest land and construction land showed an increasing trend, and the study concluded that the trend of the results of the third national land resources survey coincided (Huang, 2021). In the analysis of ECC based on land use change, a large amount of arable land was converted to construction land, and the ECC of arable land showed an upward trend, and the ECC of basin was lower, etc. also obtained similar results as some scholars could (Zhao, 2020). The comparison found our research to be advantageous and we propose a modeling framework that integrates machine learning to improve the ecological footprint and PLUS. The results of the present study are more systematic than those of Zhao (2020), which used a single method. Li (2021) uses the administrative unit as the unit of study, and base the final results on a raster for the study unit to improve accuracy and also to provide more targeted decision support. This study has applied the PLUS model with the highest accuracy for ECC prediction (Gou et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022), which enriches the research results in this area and can provide better technical support and data support. The reliability of the land use classification results is discussed in qualitative comparison with existing land use data products in order to make it more intuitively clear. This study uses the China Ecosystem-type Classification Dataset (CECD) data for comparison (Liu et al., 2014). As shown in Fig. 11 , this study also found that the spatial distribution of rivers was also found to be more consistent for both data types for all land use types. However, for fine water CECD extraction was generally effective. The river differences between the two are mainly due to the spatial resolution of the data and the method of production. The CECD data is produced by visual interpretation and often includes deltas and alluvial fans in the centre of the river for ease of mapping. Spatial consistency is best for forest and moderate for cultivated land. The consistency is better for build land, with CECD easily mapping bare land, vegetation and farmland inland of built-up areas as build land, and the results of this study are able to identify small areas of build land better. In summary, the classification results of this study are in good agreement with the CECD and the final classification results of this study are credible. 4.2 Data and methodological aspects This study uses a single dataset, different classification algorithms to analyse the difference in classification accuracy of land use types in the same study area. Differences in classification accuracy between different datasets and the same classification algorithm for the same study area were also used. This study succeeded in selecting the algorithm with the highest accuracy, showing that machine learning algorithms are very effective when applied to improve the accuracy of land use classification. The RF outperforms SVM and ANN in terms of classification efficiency, while high accuracy increases the amount of data, parameters and complexity of the classification, which all have an impact on classification efficiency. In the use of machine learning algorithms, long time-series intensive, high precision, high spatial and temporal resolution data analysis, in addition to being based on multi-source data and combining feature parameters, has become a trend and direction for research. In particular, multi-seasonal phase analysis should be carried out in water and vegetation extraction, which will continue to be considered for addition in future research. In the simulation forecasts carried out by applying the PLUS model, the drivers selected are not fully representative of the changes in ECC in the study area. The neighbourhood weights were assigned from the empirical calculations made by the previous ECC, and the conversion rule settings and simulation parameter settings are also subjective. The richness and detail of the constraint settings lead to the extent that they also affect the final simulation accuracy, which is bound to be somewhat biased. The PLUS model also suffers from limitations in the accuracy of the spatial allocation algorithm, and a comparison of simulation results with actual observations in 2020 found that the PLUS model is unable to predict new patches, the allocation model applies statically, and the drivers are all selected from historical data. If the environment in the ECC changes, there are potential changes that cannot be described. The future ECC simulations would benefit from adding dynamic environmental variables to the model reducing errors due to new patches. In the future, the inclusion of future urban ecological planning data and future climate data will continue to be explored to improve the accuracy of the simulations. 4.3 Limitations There are limitations to this study due to limited research time, data acquisition and personal competence. In the selection of algorithms for applying machine learning for land use classification, only three algorithms, namely SVM, RF and ANN, were compared and analysed. The algorithm selection is relatively traditional and insufficient in number. Deep learning algorithms such as ultra-random trees, rotating forests and convolutional neural networks are further considered in subsequent studies, and more in-depth comparative analysis of classification errors and their causes is conducted to further improve classification accuracy (Dai et al., 2020). The projections in this study are based on natural developments only and there is no discussion of multiple scenario simulation projections. Future developments are highly uncertain and should need to be explored in more ways. However, the discussion of however many scenarios is not a precise prediction of the future, but an attempt to explore possible future directions in an appropriate way to provide decision makers with response options. There is no clear indicator system for researchers at home and abroad to refer to, so there is still a certain degree of subjectivity after combining various forms of selection, and it does not fully represent the ECC of the study area, so it is difficult to use a more accurate and reasonable method to verify the scientific and systematic selection of factors. This study realises the extraction and accuracy comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms for the region, with a view to providing technical support for the screening and formulation of optimal algorithms for the extraction of intelligent land use information. This study reconstructs the pattern of ECC changes over the past 30 years and predicts the next 20 years, which is conducive to the selection of appropriate ecological development patterns and the promotion of sustainable development in the region. 5 Conclusions This study couples multi-source data to compare the overall accuracy of different algorithms and the accuracy of different land uses. It was found that coupling multi-source data and machine learning algorithms could ultimately improve the overall land use classification accuracy. The validation showed that the RF algorithm had the highest accuracy for each, with an OA of 89.4% and a kappa of 0.88. The corrected allocation prediction model was used to forecast the ECC for 2030 and 2040, and the validation results were better than the prediction results. The results show that: from 1990 to 2040, the area of cultivated land and grassland gradually decreases, the water fluctuates up and down, and the area of build land gradually increases. From 1990 to 2040 ECC as a whole belongs to the medium\u2013high, showing a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with 2000 as the inflection point, and from 2020 to 2040 the low and medium. The future focuses on the continuing changes in forests and arable land in terrestrial ecosystems. Ecological conservation is particularly important in the densely populated city of Nanning.

In recent years, the advent of machine learning techniques has yielded satisfactory results in intelligent gland cancer diagnosis based on clinical images, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical image interpretation while reducing the workload of doctors. The focus of this study is to review, classify, and analyze intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning and deep learning. This paper briefly introduces some basic imaging principles of multimodal medical images, such as the commonly used computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), positron emission tomography (PET), and pathology. In addition, the intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer were further classified into supervised learning and weakly supervised learning. Supervised learning consists of traditional machine learning methods, such as K- nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron, and deep learning methods evolving from convolutional neural network (CNN). By contrast, weakly supervised learning can be further categorized into active learning, semisupervised learning, and transfer learning. State-of-the-art methods are illustrated with implementation details, including image segmentation, feature extraction, and optimization of classifiers. Their performances are evaluated through indicators, such as accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. In conclusion, the challenges and development trends of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer were addressed and discussed.

Relevant studies have shown that with the early detection of breast cancer and timely surgical treatment, the 5-year survival rate of patients can exceed 80%, whereas that of advanced breast cancer patients is approximately 50%[1]. Cancer diagnosis is currently being streamlined. Usually, computed tomo- 2096-5796/\u00c2\u00a9Copyright 2023 Beijing Zhongke Journal Publishing Co.

The diagnosis process is mainly based on the doctors' subjective judgment; thus, the diagnosis results are subjective and largely limited by the doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 skills and experience. In particular, inexperienced doctors are prone to misdiagnosis, and even doctors with long-term practical experience have difficulty making completely consistent and accurate judgment when facing various complex diseases. Research shows that two doctors with more than 10 years of experience in abdominal imaging have only 67%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c70% accuracy in identifying 130 pancreatic cysts on CT images[2] because most of the useful information in the image is hidden in tiny gray changes, which are difficult to recognize by humans[3]. Meanwhile, as cancer rates increase with doctors having to read more images, chronic overwork is more likely to cause misdiagnoses[4]. In recent years, diagnosis methods based on artificial intelligence have attracted increasing attention because they cannot only reduce the subjectivity of human operation but can also achieve an accuracy far exceeding the level of experienced doctors[5]. It also has significant advantages in terms of efficiency. Machine learning algorithms have been used to interpret X-ray images since the mid-1960s. By the mid-1980s, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms were first used for cancer detection and diagnosis using chest radiographs and mammograms. Later, the application scope gradually expanded to imaging modes, such as CT and ultrasound[6]. Traditional CAD algorithms perform image preprocessing, image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image classification. Image preprocessing is required to improve the image quality. Various filters[7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9] can be used to remove noise, and methods such as histogram equalization[10] can be used for contrast and boundary enhancement. The purpose of image segmentation is to separate the region of interest from the image background. Common methods include threshold segmentation[11], edge detection[12], and cluster segmentation[13], among others. The extracted features can be roughly divided into two categories: external and internal features of the region. Based on feature extraction, a machine-learning algorithm is used to classify the images. Machine learning algorithms are divided into supervised and unsupervised learning based on the presence of labels. Supervised learning methods include Bayesian classifier[14] and minimum distance classifier[15], whereas unsupervised learning methods include K-means clustering algorithm[16]. Table 1 lists the number of publications on AI-based gland cancer diagnosis using supervised learning and weakly supervised learning since 2010, which indicates that this field is developing vigorously. In Figure 1, we also present a line chart to show the trends in these research fields since 2010. Data implies that in recent years, deep learning methods have dominated, which in- volves the majority of studies. Transfer learning, which is the most popular weakly supervised learning method, has developed most rapidly and has more related studies than traditional methods since 2021. Compared with manual diagnosis, although tra- ditional machine learning algorithms have made great progress in diagnosis speed with the diagnosis results able to reach a level similar to that of manual diagnosis, the quality of the results depends heavily on the selection and representation of image features[6]. In recent years, deep learning technology has been widely used because of its ability to au- Table 1 Statistics of GoogleScholar publications on AI-based gland cancer diagnosis methods since 2010 Category Specific methods Amount supervised learning traditional methods 5565 deep learning 7070 weakly supervised learning active learning 482 transfer learning 2554 semi-supervised learning 795 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 20 10 20 11 20 12 20 13 20 14 20 15 20 16 20 17 20 18 20 19 20 20 20 21 20 22 Traditional methods Active learning Semi-supervised learning Deep learning Transfer learning Year Figure 1 Research trend of Google Scholar publications on AI- based gland cancer diagnosis methods since 2010.

However, owing to the small amount of training database, deep learning technology is prone to overfitting[17]. In the medical field, owing to the small number of cases or the protection of patient privacy, there is a lack of training data available. However, deep learning algorithms lack explicability. Although the specific operation of each step in the decision-making process of the deep model is clear, it cannot be described using semantics that can be understood by humans. This paper summarizes the intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancers using machine learning. We selected a large number of representative works published in authoritative international journals and conferences within the last five years, which have proposed new directions or breakthrough solutions to the problems existing in previous methods. We also selected several landmark studies that first applied machine- learning methods to tumor imaging diagnosis. We collected diagnostic methods for multiple types of gland nodules, compared and analyzed the technical improvements of machine learning methods longitudinally, and discussed the universality of the methods among different gland types. In the second part of this paper, the imaging principles of multimodal medical images, such as the commonly used CT, MRI, US, positron emission tomography (PET), and pathology, are summarized. The third and fourth parts of this paper presents the intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on supervised learning and weakly su- pervised learning, respectively. Finally, the problems and development trends in intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer are summarized and analyzed. 2 A brief introduction to the imaging principles of commonly used medical imaging modes The urgent need for the early detection and diagnosis of diseases is driving the development of imaging models. In addition to CT, MRI, PET, and other commonly used imaging modes, photoacoustic imaging, nanoimaging, and other technologies have emerged in recent years. The imaging principles of the commonly used medical imaging modes are briefly introduced below. 2.1 Computed tomography (CT) Computed tomography mainly uses the principle of radioactive elements producing different attenuation through different media to perform gray-scale imaging. A CT image is a series of continuous cross-sectional images that can be reconstructed to show the entire organ. CT can be divided into ordinary and enhanced scanning methods. To make the lesion clearer, contrast agent injection is required for enhanced scanning; however, there are also problems such as rapid clearance of the contrast agent, potential renal toxicity, and possible allergic reactions. Despite high exposure to ionizing radiation, CT imaging has been widely used for the screening and evaluation of breast cancer[18,19], thymic carcinoma[20], lung cancer[21], and other cancers because of its faster examination speed, lower cost, and higher efficiency. 2.2 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) By applying a radiofrequency pulse with a certain frequency to the human body in a static magnetic field, a magnetic resonance phenomenon occurs when the hydrogen protons in the human body are stimulated. When the pulse is stopped, the protons produce radio signals during the relaxation process. An MRI image is generated by receiving radio signals, spatial coding, and image reconstruction. MRI images provide high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, high temporal resolution, and excellent soft tissue contrast. They can also display anatomical sectional information in a three-dimensional form. In addition, MRI does not use ionizing radiation or radioactive tracers, making it less harmful to humans than CT. The limitations of MRI are long imaging time, high equipment cost, motion artifacts, and potential implant artifacts. It is also inappropriate for Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 295 patients with pacemakers and claustrophobia[22]. Currently, MRI is mainly used for the diagnosis of prostate, breast, head and neck, and brain tumors[1]. 2.3 Ultrasound (US) imaging Ultrasound imaging uses an ultrasonic beam to scan the human body and obtain images of internal organs through the reception and processing of reflected signals. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic imaging methods because of its noninvasiveness, non-ionizing radiation, high spatial resolution, wide availability, low cost, and real-time imaging[23]. Ultrasound contrast agents have been developed to enhance acoustic signal differences between normal tissues and target lesions. The problems of ultrasound imaging lie in the high false-positive rate, image quality that is significantly affected by the level of operators, and all types of inherent artifacts and noise[24]. Ultrasound imaging technology can be applied to the screening of breast masses and the evaluation of breast density, among others[25]. 2.4 Positron emission tomography (PET) Positron emission tomography (PET) involves radioactive labeling of metabolites in cellular activities, such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and the subsequent usage of a highly sensitive camera to capture photons gen- erated during decay for imaging. Owing to the vigorous metabolism of malignant tumors, more marker compounds accumulate, which can be reflected in images, thus realizing the diagnosis and analysis of lesions. PET is a powerful and widely used medical imaging technology with the characteristics of high tissue penetration, high sensitivity, and real-time quantitative imaging analysis. In addition to anatomical in- formation, PET can provide biological information at the molecular level based on nuclide tracking. The problem with PET lies in its limited spatial resolution, dependence on the experience and knowledge of inspectors, and high inspection costs[26]. Currently, PET is primarily used for the diagnosis, metastasis, and staging of malignant tumors, such as breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, to facilitate the clinical development of better treatment plans[1]. 2.5 Pathological section imaging Pathological section imaging first requires patient biopsies to obtain pathological tissues. The pathological sections are then obtained through embedding, sectioning, staining, and other steps. Finally, the pathological sections are scanned with high resolution and full view of vision. The scanning images are seamlessly spliced to complete section digitization to finally obtain digital pathological images. Using pathological images are the most direct method for cancer diagnosis because they can provide information at the cellular level of diseased tissue. They have been also widely used in the classification, risk stratification, and prognosis of breast, thyroid, prostate, and other cancers. 2.6 Multimodal imaging PET is extremely sensitive, has sufficient tissue penetration, and provides functional information at the molecular level; however, its spatial resolution is limited. CT provides excellent spatial resolution but pro- duces a large amount of ionizing radiation. Fluorescence imaging provides optimal spatial resolution; how- ever, its tissue penetration is limited[26]. To overcome these limitations, multimodal imaging methods have been gradually developed. Applications of multimodal imaging in oncology have focused on combining anatomical imaging with functional imaging, such as PET and CT, to improve diagnostic specificity and target clarity. In recent years, the fusion of multimodal images has become more common, such as multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging sequences, different PET tracer images, and PET and MRI images, which allows the results to better characterize tumor phenotypes. PET and CT are commonly used for the diagnosis, staging, Virtual Reality & Intelligent Hardware August (2023) Vol. 5 No. 4296 and treatment of head and neck, lung, and breast cancers. PET and MRI are superior to PET and CT in specific applications, such as liver cancer, owing to the better soft tissue contrast of MRI. Studies have shown that PET and MRI have better diagnostic accuracy than single-mode imaging (multiparameter MRI and PET) for detecting the location of primary prostate cancer tumor[27]. It should be noted that multimodal imaging is a relatively new mode, and the challenge lies in uniformly preprocessing and fusing different images. As shown in Table 2, a public database of various gland cancers were collected and sorted in this study, and the information on image modes and database sizes are provided. This was a within-subjects laboratory study in which participants wore an HMD, were immersed in a virtual environment, and were required to repeatedly move forward along a road and stop at a target. The velocity of their movement on the road was controlled with different finger postures, such as curling (flexing) or ex- tending the fingers. The participants were instructed to move as rapidly as possible toward each target. The participants were aged 18 years or older and had no arm or shoulder injuries during the past month. The University Committee on Human Research approved the study, and the subjects signed an informed consent form. 3 Diagnosis method of gland cancer based on supervised learning With the development of artificial intelligence technology, several machine learning algorithms have been applied to medical image analysis and processing. Moreover, great progress has been made in the intelligent diagnosis of gland cancer, greatly reducing the burden on doctors, improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis, and reducing the occurrence of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. In general, machine learning models must learn from the training database, with each training sample corresponding to an event or object. The training sample consists of two parts: a feature vector (or sample) describing an event or object and a label representing the truth output. In the classification task, the labels represent the training sample category. In regression tasks, the label is a real value corresponding to the sample. Machine-learning methods can be divided into supervised and weakly supervised learning methods. Chapters 3 and 4 summarizes and analyzes recent research results on supervised learning and weakly supervised learning, respectively. Supervised learning requires the inference of the probability of occurrence from labeled training data. The training dataset includes a set of samples. In supervised learning, each instance comprises an input object (usually a vector) and the desired output value (also known as a supervised signal). Supervised learning algorithms perform feature analysis on a training database and generate a set of inferential logic to map new instances to the results. In recent years, the general idea in research on gland cancer diagnosis based on supervised learning has been Table 2 Public database of various gland cancers Cancer types Name Image mode Database size Pancreatic cancer NIH Pancreas-CT1 CT 82 Medical Segmentation Decathlon2 CT Unknown (Compressed package size 11.45G) Prostate cancer Medical Segmentation Decathlon2 Unknown Unknown (Compressed package size 229MB) Breast cancer Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis)3 Pathological image 9109 Thyroid cancer Thyroid Disease Data Set4 Unknown 7200 1https://academictorrents.com/details/80ecfefcabede760cdbdf63e38986501f7becd49 2https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HqEgzS8BV2c7xYNrZdEAnrHk7osJJ\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 3https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/breast-cancer-histopathological-database-breakhis/ 4https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thyroid+Disease Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 297 to segment medical images, extract features, and complete the classification of feature sets using machine learning or deep learning algorithms. Below, we classify and summarize the research achievements in the past five years based on traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms. 3.1 Diagnosis method of gland cancer based on traditional machine learning algorithm The workflow of the diagnosis method for gland cancer based on traditional machine learning can be sum- marized as follows. (1) Generate ROIs. (2) Extract handcraft features from the ROIs. (3) Select the features. (4) Classify the features using single or multiple classifiers. In 2017, Xia et al. proposed a method based on an extreme learning machine (ELM) to classify thyroid nodules as malignant or benign on ultrasound images[28]. The workflow is illustrated in Figure 2. To identify the most recognizable features, researchers used a feature selection technique based on ReliefF to score the extracted features, and the eight highest-scoring features were input into the ELM classifier. Specifically, the ELM is a multilayer perceptron with only one hidden layer. Using ELM and ReliefF, this method achieved a high accuracy of 87.72%. Similar to the ELM-based approach mentioned above[28], Mohanty et al. utilized a parameter-optimized kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) to construct an automated diagnosis system for breast cancer in 2020[29]. This system contains five phases, as detailed in Figure 3. The first step was to generate ROIs, which was conducted by manual cropping using two ground-truth parameters: the center and radius of the abnormal regions. The second step was to extract features using a cross-diagonal texture matrix (CDTM). Haralick\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2s features were then extracted from each ROI. Third, to reduce the dimension of the features and enhance the overall performance, KCPA is adopted to reduce the size of the high-dimensional feature space. Fourth, the Sonographic features collected by radiologists Split the obtained feature subsets via 10-fold cross validation scheme Training set Rank features using ReliefF Subtraining set Train Validate ELM Optimal ELM model Output Benign tumor Malignant tumor w \u00ce\u00b2 Malignant or benign Output layer Hidden layer Input layer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sh ap e C om po si tio n Ec ho ge ni ci ty C al ci fic at io n C er vi ca l L ym ph n od e Testing set Subtesting set \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Figure 2 Flowchart of the proposed thyroid cancer diagnostic system[28]. Virtual Reality & Intelligent Hardware August (2023) Vol. 5 No. 4298 grasshopper was exploited to select the optimal set of features and determine the optimal parameters of the KELM. Compared to the method proposed by Xia et al. both studies used ELM as their classifier; however, they operated with different kernel functions[28]. This method achieved an accuracy of 0.974 and 0.926 for the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) and Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) datasets, respectively. Aside from the extreme learning machine, other traditional machine learning techniques, such as K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM), have also been adopted in the detection of gland cancer. In 2018, Sadad et al. proposed a method consisting of five phases, including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification, based on Fuzzy C-Means and region growing (FCMRG), which uses hybrid texture features to detect breast cancer[30] .The workflow is illustrated in Figure 4. In the preprocessing phase, a cropping procedure was adopted to obtain the ROIs. In the segmentation phase, Feature matrix Normalize within the range [\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, 1] Divide the sample set using 5-fold cross validation Training1 Test1 Training5 Test5 Training sets Testing sets Initialize the population of GOA \u00ce\u00bb \u00ce\u00b3 1 0 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 1 Code \u00ce\u00bb, \u00ce\u00b3, and feature set Set the accuracy of KELM as fitness value Sort the fitness value of each grasshopper in descending order Evaluate the fitness value of each grasshopper on the training set Choose the current bests solution Update the best solution so far Maximum iteration?

Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 299 FCMRG was used to segment the mammographic images. FCMRG is composed of the cascading FCM, morphological operations, and region-growing methods. In the feature extraction phase, LAP-GLCM and local phase quantization (LPQ) were adopted to extract the features. In the feature selection phase, the features are selected using the mRMR algorithm, which eliminates irrelevant features and guarantees better classifi- cation. In the classification phase, KNN, SVM, and other techniques were adopted to classify the selected features. To avoid overfitting, the K-fold method was used for cross-validation. An accuracy of 0.958 was obtained for the DDSM dataset using the KNN classifier applied to LPQ features, whereas an accuracy of 0.982 was obtained for the MIAS dataset using Decision Tree on hybrid features. This method applies multiple machine learning methods on different features or hybrid features, suggesting that different low-level feature extraction methods can result in different accuracies for different datasets. Thus, more robust feature ex- traction methods are required. In 2020, Sadad et al. proposed a method comprising four phases to identify breast malignancies[31]. First, preprocessing using the Hilbert Transform was performed to rebuild the B-mode images (a two-dimensional image containing bright dots) from the raw data. Second, a region-based segmentation method called Wa- tershed Transformation[32] was adopted to segment the lesion. To overcome oversegmentation, automatic markers are introduced by dedicating the transformation only to the basins related to each marker. Third, both the texture and shape features were extracted to represent the segments. Finally, the KNN, ensemble classifier, and DT were applied with different parameters to attain promising accuracy. This method achieved a state-of- the-art performance in 2020. In 2020, Asif et al. constructed a diagnosis model of thyroid disease by using several commonly used machine learning algorithms[33], including KNN[34], SVM[35], adaptive boost algorithm (AdaBoost)[36], XGBoost algorithm (XGB)[37], Gaussian process classifier (GPC)[38], gradient boost classifier (GBC)[39], and multi-layer perceptron classifier (MLPC)[40], among others. Table 3 presents the results of the study. The classification accuracy of the MLPC is the highest, reaching 99.70%. In 2021, Masuda et al. proposed a detection method for thyroid lymph node metastasis based on SVM[41]. This study compared the accuracy of the model with image texture and morphological features as the analysis indexes. The image texture features referred to 96 texture features calculated by a computer based on the methods of wavelet filtering, grey co-occurrence matrix, and grey area size matrix, and the analysis of texture features adopted an SVM classifier. Morphological features referred to the four attributes of major axis, minor axis, volume, and sphericity, which were analyzed using a univariate logistic regression classifier. The experimental results (Figure 5) show that the SVM classifier based on 96 texture features performed better than the univariate logistic regression classifier based on the morphological method. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the former was as high as 0.96, whereas that of the latter was less than 0.70. However, with the rapid development of deep learning techniques over the past five years, researchers have gradually become aware that deep learning has greatly simplified the feature extraction process from datasets and the learning process of an algorithm model. Moreover, it has achieved a superior accuracy and precision Table 3 Research results of thyroid disease diagnosis based on machine learning algorithms[33] ML Algorithms Accuracy (%) Precision Sensitivity Specificity F1 Score ROC-AUC KNN 93.34 0.5942 0.7455 0.9514 0.6613 0.8916 SVM 96.00 0.7826 0.8182 0.9735 0.80 0.921 AdB 97.62 0.9178 0.8816 0.9892 0.8993 0.950 XGB 96.20 0.8429 0.8194 0.9803 0.8310 0.921 GPC 95.56 0.7536 0.8254 0.9701 0.7879 0.943 GBC 98.26 0.9315 0.9189 0.9910 0.9826 0.956 MLPC 99.70 0.9878 0.9878 0.9982 0.9878 0.957 Virtual Reality & Intelligent Hardware August (2023) Vol. 5 No. 4300 beyond the limits of traditional machine learning algorithms. Deep learning techniques can be adap- ted to various circumstances related to computer vision and thus perfectly fit in the detection and diagnosis of gland cancer from a mass of images. Considering the merits of deep learning, researchers have switched their focus from traditional machine- learning methods to deep learning methods. 3.2 Diagnosis method of gland cancer based on the combination of traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms Deep learning networks have mainly evolved from convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks, including AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet. These net- works have laid a solid foundation for the proposal of state-of-the-art object detection methods, such as R-CNN, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN. Over the last five years, researchers have made significant progress in utilizing various object detection techniques to spot and locate gland tumors in clinical images. This section summarizes the novel approaches for the diagnosis of gland cancer based on deep learning techniques. This section is broadly divided into two parts. First, we introduce CNN-based methods because CNN are regarded as the most fundamental component of deep learning and the basis of object detection techniques. Second, several methods based on systematic object detection models, including FPN, Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, are illustrated. In 2018, Mohamed et al. developed a novel medical imaging application based on deep learning for the two categories that are most difficult to be distinguished in clinical breast density assessment, which are \u00e2\u20ac\u00b3dispersed density\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3 and \u00e2\u20ac\u00b3heterogeneous density\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3[42]. In this system, a Bi-RADS-based breast density classification computerized reader was constructed using CNN with a large digital mammography dataset to distinguish the most difficult dual radiation density categories mentioned previously. Experiments showed that when CNN models were trained from scratch on their mammography images, the AUC was 0.9421, and the accuracy gradually improved with an increase in the training sample scale. Using the pretrained model and fine-tuning only 500 mammogram images yielded an AUC of 0.9265. After removing potentially inaccurate labeled images, the AUC increased to 0.9882 and 0.9857, which were significantly higher than the AUC with the complete imaging dataset. In 2019, Lee et al. extracted the features of thyroid ultrasound images based on various pretrained CNN networks, including AlexNet32, OverFeat-accurate, VGG-F, VGG-19, ResNet-50, and Inception-v3, classi- fied them on the feature set through SVM and Random Forest, and integrated the classification results of the two to obtain the final results[43], as shown in Figure 6. The innovative aspect of this study can be illustrated as combining features from various CNNs (feature concatenation) and combining the results from different classifiers (classifier ensemble), which achieved an accuracy of 94.7%. In 2019, Khan et al. proposed a CAD system based on multiview feature fusion (MVFF) to classify mammograms using four-view feature fusion technology[44]. The system consists of three phases. The first phase classified mammograms as abnormal or normal; the second phase classified lumps or calcifications; and the last phase classified mammograms as malignant or benign.

Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 301 operates on each view separately. The extracted features were incorporated into the final layer of the final prediction. Experiments on publicly available datasets, such as Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBRIS-DDSM) and the small MIAS mammography database, show that the system has achieved an AUC higher than all single-view based systems, with 0.932 for lumps and calcifications and 0.84 for malignancies and benign. The AUC for the normal and abnormal classifications was 0.93. In 2019, Shi et al.[45] proposed GANet, inspired by PCANet[46], which is an unsupervised deep learning network that extracts features without labeled data. GANet adopts a network structure similar to PCANet to inherit its ability to extract features effectively with fewer parameters. It also leverages Grassmann averages (GA) to solve the problem of PCANet being sensitive to noise and outliers and enhance robustness. GA can address this issue by averaging all the subspaces generated by the data on the Grassmann manifold to realize dimensionality reduction. To represent color images, quaternion algebra is adopted to learn effective feature representations containing color information. GANet achieved an average accuracy of approximately 0.81 on gray scale images from the ADL Kidney dataset, whereas quaternion-based GANet achieved an average accuracy of approximately 0.90. In 2019, Tabibu et al. proposed an SVM-DAG based diagnostic classification and survival prediction model for renal cell carcinoma (RCC)[47], as shown in Figure 7. The model extracts features from large-scale whole- slide images (WSI) of the kidneys using CNNs. The unique feature of this model is that it detects whether the images contain cancer cells and further classifies them into three subtypes: Clear Cell RCC or KIRC, Papillary RCC or KIRP, and Chromophobe RCC or KICH, reaching an accuracy of 93.39% for KIRC and 87.34% for KICH. Additionally, the model solves the problem of unbalanced database using two methods. The first method transforms an N-category decision problem into an N(-1)/2 categories dichotomy decision problem by constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) decision graph, which reduces the complexity of each decision and improves the overall decision accuracy, as shown in Figure 8. The second method involves the data augmentation of small databases and weighted resampling techniques to train the CNN. In 2020, Zhu et al. proposed a ResNet-18-based renal cell carcinoma detection method[48], which achieved an average accuracy higher than 0.95 on TCGA databases. The unique feature of this method is that it can realize the fine-grained classification of cancer cells and accurately classify the images of renal cell carcinoma into four subtypes: renal oncocytoma, Chromophobe RCC, Clear Cell RCC and Papillary RCC. Moreover, this study is potentially useful for assisting pathologists because it enables the localization and visualization of renal cell carcinoma. The workflow and research results are shown in Figure 9. In 2020, Chandio et al. proposed a classification decision method for medullary thyroid cancer based on CNN[49]. The database used in this study contained approximately 100 high-resolution microscopic images of medullary thyroid cancer with 5601 nuclei, including the class label attributes marked by doctors and the physical attributes of each nucleus.

In 2020, Mustra et al. developed an end-to-end approach named Multiscale All Convolutional Neural Network (MA-CNN) based on deep CNN, which can accurately and automatically classify mammogram images from the mini-MIAS dataset[50] into normal (without tumor) and abnormal (with tumor) patterns[51]. The proposed system consists of two main stages: context-feature extraction and classification.

Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 303 sification system, the model fuses a wide range of information contexts using multiscale filters without negotiating the computation speed. The architecture of the MA-CNN is shown in Figure 11. Experiments on the mini-MIAS mammogram image dataset showed that the proposed MA-CNN is powerful in diagnosing breast cancer, with a total classification sensitivity of 96% and an AUC of 0.99. In 2020, Zhang et al. constructed a multiview feature fusion network model to classify mammograms from two perspectives and proposed a multiscale attention network as the backbone network for feature extraction[52]. The model consists of two independent branches used to extract features from two mammograms from different views. To effectively extract the features of the entire mammogram image, the team constructed a new multiscale convolution module and integrated it into DenseNet. Simultaneously, a new attention module that connects the channel attention and spatial attention modules in parallel is proposed, and the module is added to the multi-scale convolution module. Finally, the experimental results showed that the proposed model achieves good performance in both classification tasks. The accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC values for normal and abnormal mammography were 94.92%, 96.52% and 94.72%, respectively. The accuracy, sensi- tivity, and AUC for benign and malignant mammography were 95.24%, 96.11%, and 95.03%, respectively. In 2021, Naglah et al. proposed a novel CAD system based on multimodel magnetic resonance imaging (MMRI) to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules[53]. This system is based on a novel texture- learning architecture using CNN. It is the first to combine T2-weighted MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps by using CNN to model thyroid cancer. In addition, the system learns independent texture features for each input, enabling it to simultaneously extract complex texture patterns from both patterns.

Virtual Reality & Intelligent Hardware August (2023) Vol. 5 No. 4304 Finally, the system can use multiple channels for each input to combine the collected scans into a deep learning process using different values of configurable diffusion gradient coefficients. Thus, the proposed system can learn more advanced radionics and has the added advantage of visualizing texture patterns after learning. The researchers of the study evaluated the proposed system using data collected from a cohort of 49 patients with pathologically confirmed thyroid nodules. As shown in the table, the diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were 0.87, 0.97, and 0.69, respectively, achieving better results than the other algorithms. In 2021, Naglah et al. proposed a novel CAD system based on multimodal MRI to detect thyroid cancer nodules using CNN[54]. The system was constructed using multiple inputs to perform the fusion of two MRI modes: the diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. The system can perform independent convolution processing on DWI and ADC images, which improves the possibility of detecting deep texture patterns of thyroid nodules. Additionally, the system can add additional channels to each input with the possibility of integration with other MRI modes and imaging techniques. Experimental results indicated that the diagnostic accuracy, precision, and recall of the system were 0.88, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively. In 2022, Kavitha et al. presented a novel breast cancer diagnosis model based on optimal multilevel threshold segmentation with DL-enabled Capsule Network (OMLTS-DLCN)[55]. The adaptive fuzzy median filtering (AFF) technique was used as a preprocessing step to eliminate noise from the mammogram images. Furthermore, a multilevel threshold and shell game optimization (SGO) algorithm based on optimal Kapur (OKMT-SGO) was applied to breast cancer segmentation. To detect breast cancer, the proposed model involves a CapsNet-based feature extractor and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) classification model. Experiments on the benchmark MINI-MIAS and DDSM datasets showed that the proposed model performed better than the other methods, with an accuracy of 98.50% and 97.55%, respectively. In addition to the basic CNN framework, systematic object detection methods have been widely recognized and incorporated into the diagnosis of gland cancer. In 2018, Li et al. integrated Region Proposal Network (RPN) with improved Faster R-CNN and proposed an Input (192\u00c3\u2014192) Convolution d=1 d=2 Dilated convolution Dilated convolution d=3 B 1_ C on v1 19 0\u00c3\u2014 19 0 @ 3 2 B 1_ C on v2 18 8\u00c3\u2014 18 8 @ 3 2 B 1_ C on v3 18 6\u00c3\u2014 18 6 @ 3 2 B 5_ C on v1 9\u00c3\u2014 9 @ 3 2 B 5_ C on v2 7\u00c3\u2014 7 @ 3 2 B 5_ C on v3 5\u00c3\u2014 5 @ 3 2 Concatenation 5\u00c3\u20145@96 Fully Connected MalignantNormal Benign Concatenation & convolution with stride 2 186\u00c3\u2014186@96 Figure 11 Proposed MA-CNN architecture for mammogram classification[51]. Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 305 ultrasonic image-based detection method for papillary thyroid cancer[56]. Compared with the traditional Faster R-CNN model, this study made the following optimizations: (1) It connected the conv3 and conv5 layers; and (2) A spatial constrained layer was added before the output layer, as shown in Figure 10. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy of the improved network model on the test set significantly improved, and the true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) increased from 0.868 and 0.711 to 0.935 and 0.815, respectively. The workflow and performance of the proposed method are shown in Figure 12. In 2019, Liu et al. proposed a novel CAD system based on deep learning to automatically detect and classify nodules in ultrasound images under the guidance of task-specific prior knowledge[57]. The CAD system consists of two parts: (1) a multiscale region-based detection network for learning pyramid features to detect nodules of different feature scales. They are bound by prior knowledge of the size and shape of real nodules; and (2) a multibranch classification network for integrating features. Experimental evaluation confirmed that the proposed method achieved a higher diagnostic accuracy than the previous CAD method for thyroid nodule classification, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system were better than those of experienced radiologists. In 2020, Zhang et al. proposed a novel and efficient tumor detection framework for pancreatic cancer CT images using a network model combining FPN and Faster R-CNN[58], achieving an accuracy of 90.18%. The proposed method makes the following three main contributions: enhanced feature pyramid network, adaptive feature fusion, and dependency calculation module. The improved network diagram is shown in Figure 13. Because the information propagation path in FPN is extremely long, which slows the transmission of low- level accurate positioning information, this study inputted the preprocessed CT images into the trained ResNet-101 for feature extraction. The feature pyramid through upsampling and horizontal connection were then established. To improve the detection performance by enhancing the entire feature level, a bottom-up path was established in the model to make the dissemination of low-level positioning information more effective. The model used RPN to generate candidate regions at each level, and subsequently used self-adaptive feature fusion to amplify the corresponding ROI By doing this, the model can contain high-level and low-level features simultaneously to make the context information multidimensional. In addition, the study also im- plemented a dependency calculation module, which enlarges the weighted sum of the features of all locations in region R. This was performed so that the network focuses on the interaction and dependency from local to RPN Fast R-CNN Cls layer(2k scores) 256-d feature vector Reg layer (4k coordinates) Region proposals Concat layer L2 Normalization Conv feature map ROl pooling layer spatially constrained layerCNN C onv1 C onv2 C onv3 C onv4 C onv5 FC 8 FC 7 FC 6 BBox Class score Ground truth ID1 ID2 ID3 TP TPR FP FPR TN TNR FN FNR 1881 1633 1694 1759 1 0.868 0.900 0.935 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 104 79 67 0.289 0.218 0.185 359 255 280 292 1 0.711 248 0.132 0.782 187 0.100 0.815 122 0.065 ID1 does not use any strategy.

The results in Figure 13 show that the method proposed in this study exhibits the most satisfactory performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. According to this section, it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that CNNs are suitable for processing data with spatial structure because the attributes of CNN contain the position relationship of image pixels by default, which has enabled it to become the essence of object detection. The studies mentioned in this section aim to improve the accuracy and speed of CNN through the adjustment and cascade of the network structure or the optimization of image segmentation and feature extraction in the early stage to improve the comprehensive performance of the diagnostic system. 4 Diagnosis method of gland cancer based on weakly supervised learning In contrast to supervised learning, weakly supervised learning no longer requires cumbersome pixel-level slice labeling for pathological diagnosis models. It only requires coarse-grained labels at the image level, which can significantly reduce the workload of labeling and provide new possibilities for imaging diagnosis and analysis of gland cancer. Generally, weak supervision can be classified into three types. The first type is incomplete supervision, where only a (usually extremely small) subset of the training set is labeled, and the rest of the data are not labeled. For example, in the image classification task, truth tags are provided by human taggers. Although it is easy to obtain a large number of images from the Internet, only a small subset of images can be tagged, owing to the high labor cost of tagging. The second type is inexact supervision, in which the images have only coarse- grained labels. The third type is inaccurate supervision, where the labels provided by the model are not always true values[59]. In the image analysis of gland tumors, the lack of a complete and effective labeled database is an important factor restricting the development of deep learning. Therefore, incomplete supervision is more widely used than the other two methods. This study elaborates on the application of incomplete supervision in the diagnosis of gland tumors. Among numerous machine learning paradigms developed for incompletely supervised environments, active learning, semisupervised learning, and transfer learning are the three most popular paradigms.

Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 307 4.1 Active learning The key idea of active learning is to assume that truth labels of unlabeled data can be queried by human experts, who can label the most valuable data points in the estimation model. Active learning requires selecting the most valuable unlabeled data to query human experts, of which the information amount and representa- tiveness are the two most widely used criteria. The amount of information measures the extent to which unlabeled data can reduce the uncertainty of a statistical model, whereas representativeness measures the extent to which a sample can represent the input distribution of a model. Researchers often combine these approaches to complement each other. In 2019, Lee et al. proposed a breast cancer detection method based on active learning[60]. First, only a small amount of data were labeled in the database. These labeled data were used to train the model and predict the unlabeled data, after which the newly labeled data were corrected by human experts and added to the training set to enhance the data and improve the accuracy of the model. The active learning framework is illustrated in Figure 14. The experiment shows that active learning provides better performance in the ensemble learning of six different machine learning models. Active learning can better deal with the lack of data; however, we must still look for stable methods that can fully utilize the information of the labeled data. 4.2 Semi-supervised learning Unlike active learning, semisupervised learning is a learning paradigm that analyzes and utilizes un- labeled data without the participation of human experts. In reality, although unlabeled samples have no clear label information, their data distribution characteristics are often related to the distribution of labeled samples. Therefore, researchers can con- struct and analyze models based on these statistical properties. In semisupervised learning, there are two main hypotheses regarding data distribution: clus- tering and manifold hypotheses.

Labeled data Unlabeled data EnhancementEnhancement Feature extraction Feature extraction Feature selection Select features Iteration section Features without label Data labeling Deep neural network Features with label Data weighing Figure 15 A brief flowchart of our proposed scheme[62]. Virtual Reality & Intelligent Hardware August (2023) Vol. 5 No. 4308 tection method based on semisupervised learning[61]. The WDBC database was used in the study, with half of the data in the training set labeled and half unlabeled. First, the labeled data were used for semisupervised learning. The trained model was then used to generate labels for the unlabeled data using the KNN algorithm. Subsequently, the database was k-folded, where one fold of which was taken each time as the test set, the other k-1 fold was taken as the training set. The model was trained repeatedly. Experimental results showed that this method (AISl) has higher classification accuracy than other traditional machine learning methods. Without decreasing the accuracy, semisupervised learning requires only half the time required by supervised learning methods. However, semisupervised learning methods are based on the assumption of a balanced dataset. In the imaging diagnosis of glandular nodules, it is difficult to ensure the balance of marker data in different classes. Considering an unbalanced dataset, Sun et al.[62] in 2017 proposed a semisupervised learning method with a data-weighing module based on the DROP3 instance selection method[63] and assigned different weights to different data using the weighing function. They also compared the effects of different weighing formulas, such as exponential, Gaussian, and Laplacian functions. The experiment showed that the exponential function had the most satisfactory performance in terms of labeling accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Inspired by the idea of the prototype in deep learning, utilizing a vector to represent a class, Alirezazadeh et al. proposed a new representation-learning-based unsupervised domain adaptation method in 2018 to over- come the problems of a large gap between the source and target domains and the great similarity between images of benign and malignant tumors[64]. This method utilizes handcraft features, including local binary patterns (LBP), LQP, and PFTAS, and subsequently learns a projection matrix to map the features of training and test images into the same invariant feature space, resulting in correct classification of both the training and test images. This method achieved an average accuracy of 0.885 on the BreaKHis dataset. In 2018, Koundal et al. proposed a computer-aided thyroid nodule detection system using medical ultra- sound images without any DCNN[65]. This system consists of three modules including a speckle reduction module to reduce speckle noise and preserve the diagnostic feature, a ROI auto-generating module to identify suspicious regions, and an auto-segmentation module to segment the nodule in processed ROI images. This method is fully automatic and requires no training, resulting in low accuracy and performance; however, it is an early study for us to consult. We observed that the existing weighing function can measure the importance of a single data based on its accuracy. However, in the diagnosis of certain kinds of glandular nodules, such as thyroid nodules, data from Natural Image CNN Fe3 WC1 WC2 WC3 WC4 WC5 WPC1 WPC2 Transfer Parameters WC1 WC2 WC3 WC4 WC5 WPC1 WPC2 Features Fusion Biological Image HOG L&P SIFT+VLAD Figure 16 Flowchart of deep models for transfer learning and feature fusion[67]. Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 309 the same class may have significant differences. Consequently, the traditional weighing formulas mentioned above may not perform well for other kinds of glandular nodules. Future studies should focus on dealing with unbalanced datasets and finding more suitable weighting formulas for the diagnosis of glandular nodules. 4.3 Transfer learning Transfer learning primarily uses the idea of analogy to improve the utilization rate of data. The goal of transfer learning is to use the knowledge in the source domain to solve the prediction function in the target domain under the condition that the source and target domains are different or the tasks in these domains are different[66]. In 2017, Liu et al. conducted transfer learning by applying the VGG-F model trained using ImageNet, a kind of CNN whose network structure is shown in Figure 14[67], and proposed a thyroid cancer detection method based on ultrasound images. The main contribution of this study is the proposal of an effective method for feature extraction and fusion. It fuses low-level features with high-level features extracted from the CNN network model to obtain a model with a higher classification accuracy. Low-level features include histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), scale- invariant feature transform (SIFT), and local binary patterns (LBP). High-level features include those ex- tracted from pool3, fc1, and fc2 layers in the VGGmodel. The experiment used an SVM classifier for training, and the experimental results showed that the classification results obtained by fusing the low-level features with the high-level features extracted from the pool3 layer of VGG (the fused feature set was pool3 +) had the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, some researchers have also attempted to conduct transfer learning based on AlexNet (a kind of CNN) model to identify and diagnose gland tumors. In 2019, Reda et al. proposed a prostate cancer diagnosis method based on AlexNet[68]. To reduce the cost of database annotation, the method of transfer learning was adopted. Researchers utilized a CNN pretrained by millions of images to transform its output layer, and subsequently used a small part of the data in this problem for fine-tuning, so it can effectively capture the features that require attention. This model can locate the prostate gland based on its appearance, prior shape, and spatial voxel relations. The researchers compared the classification results of the CNN and traditional machine learning classifiers (SVM, RF, and RT). The results showed that the AUC values of CNN, SVM, RF, and RT based on AlexNet were 0.93, 0.83, 0.87, and 0.50, respectively. It can be observed that the CNNmodel based on AlexNet has the best accuracy in terms of the localization and detection of prostate cancer, which also confirms the superiority of CNN in image processing and feature extraction. In 2019, Hussein et al. proposed an unsupervised method to classify lung and pancreatic pathological images, as shown in Figure 17[69]. First, clustering appearance features were adopted to estimate an initial set of labels. Second, the label proportions of each class were calculated. Finally, the initial cluster assignments and label proportions were used to train the proportion-SVM. The proposed method combining clustering with \u00ce\u00b1SVMoutperforms other approaches in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In addition to utilizing CNN to classify pathological images, some researchers have utilized generative adversarial networks (GAN), a deep learning structure based on CNN, to achieve style transfer. Pathological images were captured in various scenarios, such as different illuminations and fields of view, resulting in large uncertainties in cell shape, resolution, and color. Therefore, it is significant to narrow the gap between the source and target domains, while GAN shows a way. In 2021, Wang et al. proposed a method called prototype transfer generative adversarial network (PTGAN), which can reduce the feature distribution difference be- tween the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain, learn the category prototype in the source domain, and transfer the classification capability to the target domain[70]. This method contains two sub- modules, TBGAN and PTA, which are described in Figure 18. TBGAN refers to a target-biased generative Virtual Reality & Intelligent Hardware August (2023) Vol. 5 No. 4310 adversarial network that realizes style transfer between the source and target domains through GAN and projects the extracted features to the cross-domain. PTA refers to the prototype transfer algorithm that further transfers the features through cross-domain feature adaption loss in feature-level, with TBGAN performing the same in style-level. The results on the BreakHis dataset showed that the PTGAN achieved a high accuracy of 0.87. Transfer learning can fully utilize the general features of a task, improving the accuracy and avoiding repetitive work. However, the accuracy of the transfer learning model relies significantly on the reliability of the source domain and is not flexible to apply a transfer learning model to a new disease type. Therefore, it is important to reduce the complexity of applying the transfer learning to various disease types. 5 Summary In recent years, researchers have made numerous remarkable achievements in the field of combining machine learning with traditional medical imaging, which provides a new technical approach for the diagnosis of gland Target bias loss Ta rg et So ur ce D G A N 1o ss Cross domain loss Prototype Transfer Module Figure 18 Framework of the Prototype transfer generative adversarial network (PTGAN)[70].

Han JIANG, et al. Review of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning 311 cancer and significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in practical applications. To achieve the ultimate goal of aiding and promoting the development of medicine, we propose a possible developmental direction for medical image-related technology based on three dimensions: dataset, method, and results. Data are crucial for the effectiveness of machine learning. First, the scale of most datasets is extremely small to cover the morphology of various cancers, resulting in uneven samples and affecting the accuracy of the model for practical applications. However, large datasets face the burden of data annotation. Accurate sample labeling requires professional physicians to spend several years, which is impossible for most researchers. In addition, the labeling of current datasets typically only distinguishes malignant and benign or labels different subtypes of cancer; however, it rarely provides annotations from the perspective of tumor characteristics and cancer diagnostic criteria. Moreover, most datasets do not contain healthy tissue sections. If a large and comprehensive dataset can be constructed, more fine-grained annotation can be made on pathological sections, and even prognostic and survival data can be provided. Although this work is time-consuming, it has a huge significance for disease diagnosis and understanding cancer development. Having adequate data is ideal, and in most cases, the cost of collecting and labeling data is unacceptable. Therefore, improving the performance of a model with limited data is an extremely critical problem. The application of semisupervised learning and weakly supervised learning reduces the dependence on the data- base size to a certain extent and has achieved some results. In addition, the applications of data enhancement, transfer learning, and small-sample learning can be combined with knowledge graphs to solve the problem of insufficient data. Another concern with these methods is the interpretability of the model. Deep learning is a black box model that involves unexplainable parameters. However, in clinical settings, the diagnosis of diseases typically requires strict medical explanations; however, machine learning alone cannot reasonably explain the results. To address this problem, a reverse analysis should be performed based on these results. Step-by-step learning methods are more frequently used in CAD than end-to-end methods. The former provides good support for interpreting the diagnosis results. Possible methods for improving interpretability include extracting common patterns from the learned representations and exploring their mathematical meanings. Regarding the output of the models, the current research focuses on distinguishing between benign and malignant samples or classifying different subtypes of cancer. However, cancer treatment is not limited to yes or no questions. Histopathological examination is a qualitative diagnosis, after which the diagnosis oncologists must quantitatively detect the extent of the tumor, existence of the metastasis, size of the lesion, damage to the function of the corresponding organ, and so on. These subsequent diagnoses are important steps in tumor staging and the determination of treatment strategies and means. Currently, only a few CAD methods are aimed at distinguishing or predicting the different stages of cancer, with this information being critical for cancer treatment. Some researchers have suggested three types of diagnoses: existing cancer, non-existing cancer, and disagreement about whether cancer exists[71]. This method not only improves the diagnostic efficiency but also avoids the occurrence of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis so that doctors can focus on sections with unclear histological characteristics and promote further study of intermediate types of lesions. This problem ultimately points to the dataset; there is a vacancy for detailed annotation, which includes pixel- level labeling and a healthy tissue section. Many possibilities can be explored if a completely annotated dataset becomes available. Declaration of competing interest We declare that we have no conflict of interest.

Gland cancer is a high-incidence disease that endangers human health, and its early detection and treatment require efficient, accurate, and objective intelligent diagnosis methods. In recent years, the advent of machine learning techniques has yielded satisfactory results in intelligent gland cancer diagnosis based on clinical images, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical image interpretation while reducing the workload of doctors. The focus of this study is to review, classify, and analyze intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer based on machine learning and deep learning. This paper briefly introduces some basic imaging principles of multimodal medical images, such as the commonly used computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), positron emission tomography (PET), and pathology. In addition, the intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer were further classified into supervised learning and weakly supervised learning. Supervised learning consists of traditional machine learning methods, such as Knearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron, and deep learning methods evolving from convolutional neural network (CNN). By contrast, weakly supervised learning can be further categorized into active learning, semisupervised learning, and transfer learning. State-of-the-art methods are illustrated with implementation details, including image segmentation, feature extraction, and optimization of classifiers. Their performances are evaluated through indicators, such as accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. In conclusion, the challenges and development trends of intelligent diagnosis methods for imaging gland cancer were addressed and discussed.
